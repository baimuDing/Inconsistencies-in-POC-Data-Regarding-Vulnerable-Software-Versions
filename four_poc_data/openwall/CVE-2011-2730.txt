This is vulnerable to CVE-2010-1622 ， and CVE-2011-2730, flaws which can allow for arbitrary remote code ， execution: ， http:/support.springsource.com/security/cve-2010-1622 ， http:/support.springsource.com/security/cve-2011-2730 ， The way that Jenkins uses spring does not seem to expose an ， exploitable use case, but nonetheless it is dangerous to distribute a ， component with known serious vulnerabilities. I suggest upgrading to ， spring 2.5.6.SEC03 to mitigate these flaws. ， * Jenkins included: ， jenkins.war (unzip) ， - -> WEB-INF/plugin/maven-plugin.hpi (unzip) ， - -> WEB-INF/lib/xercesImpl-2.9.1.jar ， This copy of xerces is vulnerable to CVE-2009-2625. I have tested with ， a reproducer and confirmed it is vulnerable. The flaw relates to how ， xerces processes the SYSTEM identifier in DTDs. A remote attacker ， could provide a specially-crafted XML file, which once parsed by an ， application using xerces, would lead to a denial of service ， (application hang due to excessive CPU use). This would be exploitable ， on jenkins so long as an attacker can somehow provide an XML file that ， jenkins will process using the vulnerable copy of xerces. It seems to ， me that this would be possible, but I could be wrong. ， Either way, upgrading to xerces >= 2.10.1 will resolve this flaw: ， http:/xerces.apache.org/xerces2-j/releases.html ， So three more reasons to update =) ， Also does anyone know if kk@.suke.org is the correct email for ， Kohsuke Kawaguchi or if there is a better one? ， Kurt Seifried Red Hat Security Response Team (SRT) ， PGP: 0x5E267993 A90B F995 7350 148F 66BF 7554 160D 4553 5E26 7993"
