Our plan was to start notifications to distros and ， other vendors after discussing with OpenSSL. Codenomicon did mention ， us as the coordinator in the original text of heartbleed.com , but the ， current text reflects the situation quite well :  ， \" ， Who coordinates response to this vulnerability? ， NCSC-FI took up the task of reaching out to the authors of OpenSSL ,  ， software , operating system and appliance vendors , which were ， potentially affected. However , this vulnerability was found and ， details released independently by others before this work was ， completed. Vendors should be notifying their users and service ， providers. Internet service providers should be notifying their end ， users where and when potential action is required. ， \" ， - -Jussi / NCSC-FI ( formerly known as CERT-FI ) ",
