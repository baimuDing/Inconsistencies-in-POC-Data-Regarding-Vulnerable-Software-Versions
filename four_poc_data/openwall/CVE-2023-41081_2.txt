Such ， an implicit mapping could result in the unintended exposure of the ， status worker and/or bypass security constraints configured in httpd. As ， of JK 1.2.49 , the implicit mapping functionality has been removed and ， all mappings must now be via explicit configuration. ， Only mod_jk is affected by this issue. The ISAPI redirector is not affected.",
