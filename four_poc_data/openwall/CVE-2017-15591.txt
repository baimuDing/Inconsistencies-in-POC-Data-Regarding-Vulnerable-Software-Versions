The I/O request server page mapping ， interface uses range sets to represent I/O resources the emulation of ， which is provided by a given I/O request server. The internals of the ， range set implementation require that ranges have a starting value no ， lower than the ending one. Checks for this fact were missing. ， IMPACT ， Malicious or buggy stub domain kernels or tool stacks otherwise living ， outside of Domain0 can mount a denial of service attack which, if ， successful, can affect the whole system. ， Only domains controlling HVM guests can exploit this vulnerability. ， (This includes domains providing hardware emulation services to HVM ， guests.) ， VULNERABLE SYSTEMS ， Xen versions 4.5 and later are vulnerable. Xen versions 4.4 and ， earlier are not vulnerable. ， Only x86 systems are affected. ARM systems are not affected. ， This vulnerability is only applicable to Xen systems using stub domains ， or other forms of disaggregation of control domains for HVM guests."
