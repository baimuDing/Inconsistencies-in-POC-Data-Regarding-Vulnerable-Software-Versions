That's annoying : P As for the ， requirements it depends , different CVE requesters have different ， requirements depending on how well they do things. E.g. Some do CVE ， very well , but to make absolutely sure SPLIT/MERGE is done right I ， request some details , others like Drupal have security advisories that ， are sufficiently detailed that i can assign based on them alone , so ， until a CVE requester proves that they know what they are doing ,  ， reliably , I'm going to need details to make sure the CVE assignment is ， done correctly. Part of the issue is scale , I do 1000+ CVE assignments ， a year , so if they start taking more then 5-10 minutes I won't have ， time to do anything else ( like my day job , or sleep ) . ， > I enjoy contributing time to the community via code submissions and ， > by making flaws/fixes known to vendors via this list.
