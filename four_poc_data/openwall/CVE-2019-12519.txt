Poisoning the HTTP ， response cache with corrupted objects. ， The CVE-2019-12519 issue also overwrites arbitrary attacker ， controlled information onto the process stack. Allowing remote ， code execution with certain crafted ESI payloads. ， These problems are restricted to ESI responses received from an ， upstream server. Attackers have to compromise the server or ， transmission channel to utilize these vulnerabilities. ， _ ， Updated Packages :  ， This bug is fixed by Squid versions 4.11 and 5.0.2. ， In addition , patches addressing this problem for the stable ， releases can be found in our patch archives :  ， Squid 4 :  ， <http : /www.squid-cache.org/Versions/v4/changesets/squid-4-fdd4123629320aa1ee4c3481bb392437c90d188d.patch> ， If you are using a prepackaged version of Squid then please refer ， to the package vendor for availability information on updated ， packages. ， _ ， Determining if your version is vulnerable :  ， All Squid-2.x are not vulnerable. ， All Squid built with -disable-esi are not vulnerable. ， All Squid-3.0 versions built without -enable-esi are not ， vulnerable. ， All Squid-3.x versions built with -enable-esi are vulnerable. ， All Squid-4.x up to and including Squid-4.10 are vulnerable. ， Squid-5.0.1 is not vulnerable to the CVE-2019-12519 remote code ， execution issue. ， Squid-5.0.1 is vulnerable to the CVE-2019-12521 issues. ， _",
