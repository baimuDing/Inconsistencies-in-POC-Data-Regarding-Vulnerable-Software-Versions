When a user and password are provided for a URL with a given ， hostname , curl makes an effort to not pass on those credentials to other hosts ， in redirects unless given permission with a special option. ， This \"same host check\" has been flawed all since it was introduced. It does ， not work on cross protocol redirects and it does not consider different port ， numbers to be separate hosts. This leads to curl leaking credentials to other ， servers when it follows redirects from auth protected HTTP ( S ) URLs to other ， protocols and port numbers. It could also leak the TLS SRP credentials this ， way. ， By default , curl only allows redirects to HTTP ( S ) and FTP ( S )  , but can be asked ， to allow redirects to all protocols curl supports. ， We are not aware of any exploit of this flaw. ， INFO ， This flaw was added in curl 4.9 with the introduction of `-location` and has ， been present in all libcurl versions ever released. In July 2000 in the curl ， 7.1.1 release ,  [ this commit ]  ( https : /github.com/curl/curl/commit/29eda80f9669f ) was the first ， version that attempted to avoid this , but the check has been bad since then. ， The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures ( CVE ) project has assigned the name ， CVE-2022-27774 to this issue. ， CWE-522 : Insufficiently Protected Credentials ， Severity : Medium ， AFFECTED VERSIONS ， - Affected versions : curl 4.9 to and including 7.82.0 ， - Not affected versions : curl < 4.9 and curl >= 7.83.0 ， Note that libcurl is used by many applications , but not always advertised as ， such. ， THE SOLUTION ， There are two separate patches to apply for CVE-2022-27774 :  [ the main ， one ]  ( https : /github.com/curl/curl/commit/620ea21410030a997 ) and [ the SRP ， follow-up ]  ( https : /github.com/curl/curl/commit/139a54ed0a172ada ) .",
