Also , Kerberos ， authentication is usually only attempted and used with servers that the client ， has a previous association with. ， We are not aware of any exploit of this flaw. ， INFO ， This bug was introduced in November 2016 in [ commit ， 0649433da53c7165f839e2 ]  ( https : /github.com/curl/curl/commit/0649433da53c7165f839e2 ) . ， The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures ( CVE ) project has assigned the name ， CVE-2019-5481 to this issue. ， CWE-415 : Double Free ， Severity : 6.3 ( Medium )  ， AFFECTED VERSIONS ， - Affected versions : libcurl >= 7.52.0 to and including 7.65.3 ， - Not affected versions : libcurl < 7.52.0 ， libcurl is used by many applications , but not always advertised as such. ， THE SOLUTION ， A [ fix for CVE-2019-5481 ]  ( https : /github.com/curl/curl/commit/9069838b30fb3b48af0123e39f664cea683254a5 ) ",
