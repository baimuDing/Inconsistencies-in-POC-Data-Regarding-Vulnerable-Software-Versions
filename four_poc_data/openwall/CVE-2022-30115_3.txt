This mechanism could be bypassed if the host name in the given URL used a ， trailing dot while not using one when it built the HSTS cache. Or the other ， way around - by having the trailing dot in the HSTS cache and * not * using the ， trailing dot in the URL. ， Since trailing dots in host names are somewhat special , many sites work ， equally fine with or without a trailing dot present. ， We are not aware of any exploit of this flaw. ， INFO ， This flaw was introduced in [ commit ， b27ad8e1d3e68e ]  ( https : /github.com/curl/curl/commit/b27ad8e1d3e68e )  , shipped ， in curl 7.82.0 when the treatment of trailing dot host names was changed. ， Similar issues have been raised in the past for ，  [ Firefox ]  ( https : /www.mozilla.org/en-US/security/advisories/mfsa2015-13/ ) and ， The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures ( CVE ) project has assigned the name ， CVE-2022-30115 to this issue. ， CWE-319 : Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information ， Severity : Medium ， AFFECTED VERSIONS ， - Affected versions : curl 7.82.0 to and including 7.83.0 ， - Not affected versions : curl < 7.82.0 and curl >= 7.83.1 ， libcurl is used by many applications , but not always advertised as such !  ， THE SOLUTION ， A [ fix for CVE-2022-30115 ]  ( https : /github.com/curl/curl/commit/fae6fea209a2d4d ) ",
