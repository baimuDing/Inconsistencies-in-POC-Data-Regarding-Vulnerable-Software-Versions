This locking includes temporarily increasing ， the type reference count by one. When the page is later unlocked, the ， context precludes cleanup, so the reference that is then dropped must ， not be the last one. This was not properly enforced. ， IMPACT ， A malicious or buggy PV guest may cause a memory leak upon shutdown ， of the guest, ultimately perhaps resulting in Denial of Service (DoS) ， affecting the entire host. ， VULNERABLE SYSTEMS ， All Xen versions from 3.4 onwards are vulnerable. Xen versions 3.3 and ， earlier are not vulnerable. ， Only x86 systems are affected. ARM systems are not affected. ， Only x86 PV guests can leverage the vulnerability. x86 HVM guests ， cannot leverage the vulnerability."
