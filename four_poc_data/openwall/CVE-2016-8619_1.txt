When reading one of the length fields from the socket , it fails to ， ensure that the length parameter passed to realloc (  ) is not set to 0. ， This would lead to realloc (  ) getting called with a zero size and when doing so ， realloc (  ) returns NULL * and * frees the memory - in contrary to normal ， realloc (  ) fails where it only returns NULL - causing libcurl to free the ， memory * again * in the error path. ， This flaw could be triggered by a malicious or just otherwise ill-behaving ， server. ， We are not aware of any exploit of this flaw. ， INFO ， The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures ( CVE ) project has assigned the name ， CVE-2016-8619 to this issue. ， AFFECTED VERSIONS ， This flaw exists in the following curl versions ， - Affected versions : curl 7.3 to and including 7.50.3 ， - Not affected versions : curl < 7.3 and curl >= 7.51.0 ， libcurl is used by many applications , but not always advertised as such !  ， THE SOLUTION ， In version 7.51.0 , the function reading data will consider reading a zero size ， to be an error and bail out. ， A [ patch for CVE-2016-8619 ]  ( https : /curl.hax.se/CVE-2016-8619.patch ) is ， available.",
