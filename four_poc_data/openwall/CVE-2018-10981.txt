The requests themselves ， are placed in a memory page shared with the device model, so that the ， device model can communicate to Xen its progress on the request. The ， state field is in the request itself, where the device model may write ， to it. Xen correctly rejects invalid state values, but failed to reject ， invalid transitions between states. As a result, a device model which ， switches a request between two states at the right times can drive Xen ， into an unbounded loop. ， IMPACT ， A malicious unprivileged device model can cause a Denial of Service ， (DoS) affecting the entire host. Specifically, it may prevent use of a ， physical CPU for an indeterminate period of time. ， VULNERABLE SYSTEMS ， All Xen versions are vulnerable. ， Only x86 systems are affected. ARM systems are not affected. ， Only HVM guests can expose this vulnerability. PV and PVH guests cannot ， expose this vulnerability, but note that the domains being able to ， leverage the vulnerability are PV or PVH ones, running the device model. ， This vulnerability is only applicable to Xen systems using stub domains."
