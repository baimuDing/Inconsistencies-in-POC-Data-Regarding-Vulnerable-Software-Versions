The recording of the respective limit during domain ， initialization, however, has occurred at a time where domains are still ， deemed to be 64-bit ones, prior to actually honoring respective domain ， properties. At the point domains get recognized as 32-bit ones, the ， limit didn't get updated accordingly. ， Due to this misbehavior in Xen, 32-bit domains (including Domain 0) ， servicing other domains may observe event channel allocations to succeed ， when they should really fail. Subsequent use of such event channels ， would then possibly lead to corruption of other parts of the shared ， info structure. ， IMPACT ， An unprivileged guest may cause another domain, in particular Domain 0, ， to misbehave. This may lead to a Denial of Service (DoS) for the entire ， system. ， VULNERABLE SYSTEMS ， All Xen versions from 4.4 onwards are vulnerable. Xen versions 4.3 and ， earlier are not vulnerable. ， Only x86 32-bit domains servicing other domains are vulnerable. ， Arm systems as well as x86 64-bit domains are not vulnerable."
