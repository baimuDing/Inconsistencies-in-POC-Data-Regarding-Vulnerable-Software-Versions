There is no direct statement that ， the addressbook group vulnerability was fixed. It seems likely that ， the addressbook group vulnerability could cross privilege boundaries ， an administrator who was visiting the addressbook of an unprivileged ， user. ， The other issues were discovered by und3r and affect version 0.9.2. At ， least one of these issues ( JavaScript code in the signature ) also ， affects version 1.0-git. There seems to be a dispute about whether ， this signature issue crosses privilege boundaries. Apparently a user ， can use the signature issue to attack himself , but there is no ， discussion of whether an administrator can visit the \"identity ， configuration page\" of an unprivileged user , and thereby become a ， victim of the XSS attack. The signature issue might be interpreted as ， a CVE-2012-4668 regression. Also , there is some indication that all of ， the issues discovered by und3r might have a root cause of 'This kind ， of problem is present in all parts where there is the \"MCE\" editor ，  ( or , more specifically , where there is a <textarea> with the CSS class ， \"mce_editor\" ) .' ， Thus , so far , it seems that we should have one CVE for the addressbook ， group vulnerability , and one CVE for all of the vulnerabilities ， discovered by und3r. If anyone has established that the ， vulnerabilities discovered by und3r don't all have the same affected ， versions , please let us know. Also , if anyone thinks that the ， vulnerabilities discovered by und3r were actually the responsibility ， of a third-party product ( such as TinyMCE )  , please mention that as ， well. ， CVE assignment team , MITRE CVE Numbering Authority ， M/S M300 ， 202 Burlington Road , Bedford , MA 01730 USA ，  [ PGP key available through http : /cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] ",
