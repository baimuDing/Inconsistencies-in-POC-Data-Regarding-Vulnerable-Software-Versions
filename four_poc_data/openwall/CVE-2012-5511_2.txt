If the size of that bitmap is overly large , an intermediate ， variable on the hypervisor stack may overflow that stack. ， IMPACT ， A malicious guest administrator can cause Xen to become unresponsive ， or to crash leading in either case to a Denial of Service. ， VULNERABLE SYSTEMS ， All Xen versions from 3.4 onwards are vulnerable. ， However Xen 4.2 and unstable are not vulnerable to the stack ， overflow. Systems running either of these are not vulnerable to the ， crash. ， Version 3.4 , 4.0 and 4.1 are vulnerable to both the stack overflow and ， the physical CPU hang. ， The vulnerability is only exposed to HVM guests.",
