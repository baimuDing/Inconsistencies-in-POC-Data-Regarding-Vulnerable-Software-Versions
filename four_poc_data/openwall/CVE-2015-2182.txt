This patch seems ， related to: ， prodid ， qty ， variations ， subId ， whereas your report is about: ， id ， cid ， (An entirely separate issue is that the patch has a \"$_POST['qty'] = ， abs(int)$_GET['prodid']);\" line that might result in unintended ， quantity values.) ， So, we think that there is not, in any sense, a \"version\" of ZeusCart ， that fixes any attack vector that you reported. If there were an ， incomplete fix, additional CVE IDs may be required. ， Use CVE-2015-2183 for all of the SQL injection issues in your report. ， > http:/{TARGET}/admin/?do=getphpinfo ， Use CVE-2015-2184. ， CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority ， M/S M300 ， 202 Burlington Road, Bedford, MA 01730 USA ， [ PGP key available through http:/cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ]"
