    "text": "Subject :  [ SECURITY ]  [ UPDATE ] CVE-2016-8745 Apache Tomcat Information Disclosure ， CVE-2016-8745 Apache Tomcat Information Disclosure ， Severity : Important ， Vendor : The Apache Software Foundation ， Versions Affected :  ， Apache Tomcat 9.0.0.M1 to 9.0.0.M13 ， Apache Tomcat 8.5.0 to 8.5.8 ， Apache Tomcat 8.0.0.RC1 to 8.0.39 ( new )  ， Apache Tomcat 7.0.0 to 7.0.73 ( new )  ， Apache Tomcat 6.0.16 to 6.0.48 ( new )  ， Description ， A bug in the error handling of the send file code for the NIO HTTP ， connector resulted in the current Processor object being added to the ， Processor cache multiple times. This in turn meant that the same ， Processor could be used for concurrent requests. Sharing a Processor can ， result in information leakage between requests including , not not ， limited to , session ID and the response body. ， The bug was first noticed in 8.5.x onwards where it appears the ， refactoring of the Connector code for 8.5.x onwards made it more likely ， that the bug was observed. Initially it was thought that the 8.5.x ， refactoring introduced the bug but further investigation has shown that ， the bug is present in all currently supported Tomcat versions.",
