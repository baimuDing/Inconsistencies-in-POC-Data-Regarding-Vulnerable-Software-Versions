This can result in the event ， handling loop running for an extended time if new events are coming in ， at a high rate. In extreme cases this can lead to a complete hang of ， the kernel, resulting in a DoS situation of the host when dom0 is ， affected. ， IMPACT ， Malicious guests can hang the host by sending events to dom0 at a high ， frequency. ， VULNERABLE SYSTEMS ， All systems with a Linux dom0 are affected. ， All Linux kernel versions are affected."
