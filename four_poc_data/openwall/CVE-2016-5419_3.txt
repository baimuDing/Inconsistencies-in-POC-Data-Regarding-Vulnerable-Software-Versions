Users of ， libcurl/NSS that load client certificates from files are encouraged to ， also apply the attached follow-up patch. ， The original patch for CVE-2016-5420 has been amended to also contain the ， attached patch :  ， https : /curl.hax.se/CVE-2016-5420.patch ， > VULNERABILITY ， > libcurl did not consider client certificates when reusing TLS connections. ， > libcurl supports reuse of established connections for subsequent requests. ， > It does this by keeping a few previous connections \"alive\" in a connection ， > pool so that a subsequent request that can use one of them instead of ， > creating a new connection will do so. ， > When using a client certificate for a connection that was then put into the ， > connection pool , that connection could then wrongly get reused in a ， > subsequent request to that same server that either didn't use a client ， > certificate at all or that asked to use a different client certificate thus ， > trying to tell the user that it is a different entity. ， > This mistakenly using the wrong connection could of course lead to ， > applications sending requests to the wrong realms of the server using ， > authentication that it wasn't supposed to have for those operations. ， > We are not aware of any exploit of this flaw. ， > INFO ， > This flaw also affects the curl command line tool. ， > The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures ( CVE ) project has assigned the name ， > CVE-2016-5420 to this issue. ， > AFFECTED VERSIONS ， > This flaw is relevant for all versions of curl and libcurl that support ， > SSL/TLS and client certificates. ， > - Affected versions : libcurl 7.1 to and including 7.50.0 ， > - Not affected versions : libcurl >= 7.50.1 ， > libcurl is used by many applications , but not always advertised as such !  ， > THE SOLUTION ， > In version 7.50.1 , curl will check that re-used connections have the correct ， > client certificate ( file name ) before used. ， > A [ patch for CVE-2016-5420 ]  ( https : /curl.hax.se/CVE-2016-5420.patch ) is ， > available.
