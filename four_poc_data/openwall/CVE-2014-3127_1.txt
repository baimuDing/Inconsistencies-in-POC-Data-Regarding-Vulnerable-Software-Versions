    "text": "Cc : cve-assign @ .re.org , oss-security @ .ts.openwall.com ， Subject : Re : CVE request : another path traversal in dpkg-source during unpack ， -BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE- ， Hash : SHA1 ， > Another path traversal was discovered ， The short answer is that bug 746498 is CVE-2014-3864 , and bug 749183 ， is CVE-2014-3865. We can also , first , review the status of the CVEs ， related to our 1 May 2014 message. The proposed CVE mappings for all ， four of these CVEs are indicated below ; these would potentially start ， to be processed for the cve.mitre.org web site as early as today. ， CVE-2014-3127 ( revised CVE description to be published at ， http : /cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-3127 soon )  :  ， dpkg 1.15.9 on Debian squeeze introduces support for the \"C-style ， encoded filenames\" feature without recognizing that the squeeze patch ， program lacks this feature , which triggers an interaction error that ， allows remote attackers to conduct directory traversal attacks and ， modify files outside of the intended directories via a crafted source ， package. NOTE : this can be considered a release engineering problem in ， the effort to fix CVE-2014-0471. ， CVE-2014-3227 ( new CVE to be published at ， http : /web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2014-3227 and ， http : /cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-3227 soon )  :  ， dpkg 1.15.9 , 1.16.x before 1.16.14 , and 1.17.x before 1.17.9 expect ， the patch program to be compliant with a need for the \"C-style encoded ， filenames\" feature , but is supported in environments with noncompliant ， patch programs , which triggers an interaction error that allows remote ， attackers to conduct directory traversal attacks and modify files ， outside of the intended directories via a crafted source package. ， NOTE : this vulnerability exists because of reliance on unrealistic ， constraints on the behavior of an external program. ， CVE-2014-3864 ( new CVE to be published at ， http : /web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2014-3864 and ， http : /cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-3864 soon )  :  ，  ( reference is ， https : /bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=746498 )  ， Directory traversal vulnerability in dpkg-source 1.3.0 allows remote ， attackers to modify files outside of the intended directories via a ， crafted source package that lacks a - header line. ， CVE-2014-3865 ( new CVE to be published at ， http : /web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2014-3865 and ， http : /cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-3865 soon )  :  ，  ( reference is ， https : /bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=749183 )  ， Multiple directory traversal vulnerabilities in dpkg-source 1.3.0 ， allow remote attackers to modify files outside of the intended ， directories via a source package with a crafted Index : pseudo-header ， in conjunction with ( 1 ) missing - and + header lines or ( 2 ) a + ， header line with a blank pathname. ， CVE assignment team , MITRE CVE Numbering Authority ， M/S M300 ， 202 Burlington Road , Bedford , MA 01730 USA ，  [ PGP key available through http : /cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] ",
