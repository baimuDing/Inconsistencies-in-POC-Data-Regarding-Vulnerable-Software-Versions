They accept custom string length inputs in signed integer ， arguments. ( The functions having names without \"easy\" being the deprecated ， versions of the others. )  ， The provided string length arguments were not properly checked and due to ， arithmetic in the functions , passing in the length 0xffffffff ( 2^32-1 or ， `UINT_MAX` or even just -1 ) would end up causing an allocation of zero bytes ， of heap memory that curl would attempt to write gigabytes of data into. ， The use of 'int' for this input type in the API is of course unwise but has ， remained so in order to maintain the API over the years. ， We are not aware of any exploit of this flaw. ， INFO ， This flaw does not affect the curl command line tool. ， The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures ( CVE ) project has assigned the name ， CVE-2016-7167 to this issue. ， AFFECTED VERSIONS ， This flaw exists in the following libcurl versions. ， - Affected versions : libcurl 7.11.1 to and including 7.50.2 ， - Not affected versions : libcurl < 7.11.1 and libcurl >= 7.50.3 ， libcurl is used by many applications , but not always advertised as such !  ， THE SOLUTION ， In version 7.50.3 , these functions will deny negative string lengths from ， being used. ， A [ patch for CVE-2016-7167 ]  ( https : /curl.hax.se/CVE-2016-7167.patch ) is ， available.",
