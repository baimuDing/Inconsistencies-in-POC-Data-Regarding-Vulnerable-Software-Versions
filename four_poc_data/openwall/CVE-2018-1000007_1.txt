It existed in the first commit we ， have recorded in the project. ， The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures ( CVE ) project has assigned the name ， CVE-2018-1000007 to this issue. ， AFFECTED VERSIONS ， - Affected versions : libcurl 7.1 to and including 7.57.0 ， - Not affected versions : libcurl >= 7.58.0 ， libcurl is used by many applications , but not always advertised as such. ， THE SOLUTION ， In libcurl version 7.58.0 , custom `Authorization : ` headers will be limited the ， same way other such headers is controlled within libcurl : they will only be ， sent to the host used in the original URL unless libcurl is told that it is ok ， to pass on to others using the `CURLOPT_UNRESTRICTED_AUTH` option. ，  * NOTE *  : this solution creates a slight change in behavior. Users who ， actually want to pass on the header to other hosts now need to give curl that ， specific permission. You do this with ，  [ -location-trusted ]  ( https : /curl.hax.se/docs/manpage.html # -location-trusted )  ， with the curl command line tool. ， A [ patch for ， CVE-2018-1000007 ]  ( https : /github.com/curl/curl/commit/af32cd3859336ab.patch )  ， is available.",
