ARM systems are not vulnerable. ， Only Xen versions 4.11 and onwards are vulnerable. 4.10 and earlier are ， not vulnerable. ， Only x86 systems which do not implement the MISC_ENABLE MSR (0x1a0) are ， vulnerable. AMD and Hygon systems do not implement this MSR and are ， vulnerable. Intel systems do implement this MSR and are not vulnerable. ， Other manufacturers have not been checked. ， Only x86 PV guests can exploit the vulnerability. x86 HVM/PVH guests ， cannot exploit the vulnerability."
