A bug in how this logic deals with accesses spanning ， multiple fields allows the guest to write to the host MSI message data ， field. ， While generally the writes write back the values previously read, ， their value in config space may have got changed by the host between ， the qemu read and write. In such a case host side interrupt handling ， could become confused, possibly losing interrupts or allowing spurious ， interrupt injection into other guests. ， IMPACT ， Certain untrusted guest administrators may be able to confuse host ， side interrupt handling, leading to a Denial of Service. ， VULNERABLE SYSTEMS ， Xen versions 3.3 and onwards are vulnerable due to supporting PCI ， pass-through. ， Only x86 systems are vulnerable. ARM systems are not vulnerable. ， Only HVM guests with their device model run in Dom0 can take advantage ， of this vulnerability. ， Only HVM guests which have been granted access to physical PCI devices ， (`PCI passthrough') can take advantage of this vulnerability. ， Furthermore, the vulnerability is only applicable when the ， passed-through PCI devices are MSI-capable. (Most modern devices ， are.)"
