That is unacceptable since a server by specification is allowed ， to skip the client certificate check on resume , and may instead use the old ， identity which was established by the previous certificate ( or no ， certificate ) . ， libcurl supports by default the use of TLS session id/ticket to resume ， previous TLS sessions to speed up subsequent TLS handshakes. They are used ， when for any reason an existing TLS connection couldn't be kept alive to make ， the next handshake faster. ， This flaw is a regression and identical to ，  [ CVE-2016-5419 ]  ( https : /curl.hax.se/docs/adv_20160803A.html ) reported on ， August 3rd 2016 , but affecting a different version range. ， We are not aware of any exploit of this flaw. ， INFO ， This flaw also affects the curl command line tool. ， For version 7.52.0 , we rearranged a lot of TLS code to bring support for HTTPS ， proxies , which unfortunately made us accidentally bring this old flaw back !  ， The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures ( CVE ) project has assigned the name ， CVE-2017-7468 to this issue. ， AFFECTED VERSIONS ， This flaw is relevant for all versions of curl and libcurl that support TLS ， and client certificates. ， - Affected versions : curl 7.52.0 to and including 7.53.1 ， - Not affected versions : curl < 7.52.0 and >= 7.54.0 ， libcurl is used by many applications , but not always advertised as such !  ， THE SOLUTION ， TLS session resumption is disabled when a client certificate is used so that a ， subsequent connection attempt to the same server cannot risk getting a ， previously authenticated session resumed. ， A [ patch for CVE-2017-7468 ]  ( https : /curl.hax.se/CVE-2017-7468.patch ) is ， available.",
