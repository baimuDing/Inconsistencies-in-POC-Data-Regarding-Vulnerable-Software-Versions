This can trigger a REQUIRE assertion ， failure when those records are subsequently cached. Intentional ， exploitation of this condition is possible and could be used as ， a denial-of-service vector against servers performing recursive ， queries. ， Impact :  ， An attacker who can cause a server to request a record with a ， malformed class attribute can use this bug to trigger a REQUIRE ， assertion in db.c , causing named to exit and denying service to ， clients. The risk to recursive servers is high. Authoritative ， servers are at limited risk if they perform authentication when ， making recursive queries to resolve addresses for servers listed ， in NS RRSETs. ， CVSS Score : 7.1 ， CVSS Vector :  ( AV : N/AC : M/Au : N/C : N/I : N/A : C )  ， For more information on the Common Vulnerability Scoring System and ， to obtain your specific environmental score please visit :  ， https : /nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?calculator&version=2&vector= ( AV : N/AC : M/Au : N/C : N/I : N/A : C ) ",
