However, a ， change made to the implementation of the select view means that any ， user-supplied data bound to an option's label will not be escaped ， correctly. ， In applications that use Ember's select view and pass user-supplied ， content to the label, a specially-crafted payload could execute ， arbitrary JavaScript in the context of the current domain (\"XSS\"). ， All users running an affected release and binding user-supplied data to ， the select options should either upgrade or use one of the workarounds ， immediately. ， Releases ， Releases are available on emberjs.com/builds/#/tagged"
