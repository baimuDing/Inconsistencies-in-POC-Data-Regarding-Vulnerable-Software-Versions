The title for version 1 gave CVE-2022-21124 which was ， incorrect and should have been CVE-2022-21125. ， Patches are now reviewed. Backports are available. ， ISSUE DESCRIPTION ， This issue is related to the SRBDS, TAA and MDS vulnerabilities. Please ， see: ， https:/xenbits.xen.org/xsa/advisory-320.html (SRBDS) ， https:/xenbits.xen.org/xsa/advisory-305.html (TAA) ， https:/xenbits.xen.org/xsa/advisory-297.html (MDS) ， Please see Intel's whitepaper: ， https:/www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/articles/technical/software-security-guidance/technical-documentation/processor-mmio-stale-data-vulnerabilities.html ， IMPACT ， An attacker might be able to directly read or infer data from other ， security contexts in the system. This can include data belonging to ， other VMs, or to Xen itself. The degree to which an attacker can obtain ， data depends on the CPU, and the system configuration. ， VULNERABLE SYSTEMS ， Systems running all versions of Xen are affected. ， Only x86 processors are vulnerable. Processors from other manufacturers ， (e.g. ARM) are not believed to be vulnerable. ， Only Intel based processors are affected. Processors from other x86 ， manufacturers (e.g. AMD) are not believed to be vulnerable. ， Please consult the Intel Security Advisory for details on the affected ， processors and configurations. ， Per Xen's support statement, PCI passthrough should be to trusted ， domains because the overall system security depends on factors outside ， of Xen's control. ， As such, Xen, in a supported configuration, is not vulnerable to ， DRPW/SBDR."
