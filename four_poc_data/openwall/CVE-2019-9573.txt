Plugin URL ， https:/wordpress.org/plugins/hrm/. Affected 2.2.5 and possibly below. Fixed in ， 2.2.6 according to developer who didn't respond to me, but communicated with ， WordPress. ， https:/cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-9574 ， When creating new leave as admin user there is user picker visible in the UI. ， Using same queries as picker functionality any logged in user (e.g. ， Subscriber) can use search_emp_leave_records action to print all WordPress ， users credentials from database. ， {\"success\":true,\"data\":[{\"ID\":\"1\",\"user_login\":\"henri\",\"user_pass\":\"$P$Bho3. ， https:/cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-9573 ， Any user can create new leave and can change status of leave (approving, ， canceling etc). ， Recommendation for developers: ， Authorize users using a whitelist of roles allowed to call specific actions. ， Define roles for all actions with secure default e.g. admin only. Ensure that ， password hashes are not printed to any user. Function ， https:/codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/get_users could be used to list ， the users."
