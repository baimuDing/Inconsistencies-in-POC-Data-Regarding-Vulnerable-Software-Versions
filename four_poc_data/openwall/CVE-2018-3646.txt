If data resides in the L1D cache, it ， may be forwarded to dependent instructions, and may be leaked via a side ， channel. ， Furthermore: ， * SGX protections are not applied ， * EPT guest to host translations are not applied ， * SMM protections are not applied ， This issue is split into multiple CVEs depending on circumstance. The ， CVEs which apply to Xen are: ， * CVE-2018-3620 - Operating Systems and SMM ， * CVE-2018-3646 - Hypervisors ， For more details, see: ， https:/www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/security-center/advisory/intel-sa-00161.html ， IMPACT ， An attacker can potentially read arbitrary host RAM. This includes data ， belonging to Xen, data belonging to other guests, and data belonging to ， different security contexts within the same guest. ， An attacker could be a guest kernel (which can manipulate the pagetables ， directly), or could be guest userspace either directly (e.g. with ， mprotect() or similar system call) or indirectly (by gaming the guest ， kernel's paging subsystem). ， VULNERABLE SYSTEMS ， Systems running all versions of Xen are affected. ， Only x86 processors are vulnerable. ARM processors are not known to be ， affected. ， Only Intel Core based processors (from at least Merom onwards) are ， potentially affected. Other processor designs (Intel Atom/Knights ， range), and other manufacturers (AMD) are not known to be affected. ， x86 PV guests fall into the CVE-2018-3620 (OS and SMM) category. x86 ， HVM and PVH guests fall into the CVE-2018-3646 (Hypervisors) category."
