For PV guests, this is done by nominating ， an existing linear address, or an L1 pagetable entry, to be altered. ， Neither of these PV paths check for alignment of the passed parameter. ， The linear address path suitably truncates the linear address when ， calculating the L1 entry to use, but the path which uses a directly ， nominated L1 entry performs no checks. ， This causes Xen to make an incorrectly-aligned update to a pagetable, ， which corrupts both the intended entry and the subsequent entry with ， values which are largely guest controlled. If the misaligned value ， crosses a page boundary, then an arbitrary other heap page is ， corrupted. ， IMPACT ， A PV guest can elevate its privilege to that of the host. ， VULNERABLE SYSTEMS ， All versions of Xen are vulnerable. ， Only x86 systems are vulnerable. ， Any system running untrusted PV guests is vulnerable. ， The vulnerability is exposed to PV stub qemu serving as the device model ， compromised its PV stub qemu. By extension, it is likely that the ， vulnerability is exposed to HVM guests which are served by a PV stub ， qemu."
