This ， normally cascades into the whole system freezing, resulting in a a ， host Denial of Service (DoS). ， VULNERABLE SYSTEMS ， Xen versions from 3.4.x onwards are affected. ， Only x86 systems are vulnerable. ARM is not vulnerable. ， x86 PV VMs cannot leverage the vulnerability. ， Only systems with 2MiB or 1GiB HAP pages enabled are vulnerable. ， The vulnerability is largely restricted to HVM guests which have been ， constructed in Populate-on-Demand mode (i.e. with memory < maxmem): ， x86 HVM domains without PoD (i.e. started with memory = maxmem, or ， without mentioning \"maxmem\" in the guest config file) also cannot ， leverage the vulnerability, in recent enough Xen versions: ， 4.8.x and later: all versions safe if PoD not configured ， 4.7.x: 4.7.1 and later safe if PoD not configured ， 4.6.x: 4.6.4 and later safe if PoD not configured ， 4.5.x: 4.5.4 and later safe if PoD not configured ， 4.4.x and earlier: all versions vulnerable even if PoD not configured ， The commit required to prevent this vulnerability when PoD ， not configured is 2a99aa99fc84a45f505f84802af56b006d14c52e ， xen/physmap: Do not permit a guest to populate PoD pages for itself ， and the corresponding backports."
