It was assigned already ， > beginning of Dec. last year. ， > Roland ， According to the Wikipedia entry on CVE ( which I rewrote = )  :  ， http : /en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Vulnerabilities_and_Exposures # Date_Entry_Created ， Date Entry Created ， This is the date the entry was created. Please note that for CVEs ， assigned directly by Mitre this is the date Mitre created the CVE ， entry. For CVEs assigned by CNAs ( e.g. Microsoft , Oracle , HP , Red Hat ,  ， etc. ) this is also the date the entry was create by Mitre , not by the ， CNA. So in the case where a CNA requests a block of CVE numbers in ， advance ( e.g. Red Hat currently requests CVEs in blocks of 500 ) the ， entry date would be when that CVE is assigned to the CNA. The CVE ， itself may not be used for days , weeks , months or even possibly years ，  ( e.g. Red Hat maintains blocks of CVEs for older security issues in ， Open Source software that were not assigned a CVEs yet ) . ， So late last year I asked for and received a block of 2014 CVE's from ， Mitre which we are now assigning as issues come to light. So yeah ,  ， we're all good. ， Kurt Seifried Red Hat Security Response Team ( SRT )  ， PGP : 0x5E267993 A90B F995 7350 148F 66BF 7554 160D 4553 5E26 7993",
