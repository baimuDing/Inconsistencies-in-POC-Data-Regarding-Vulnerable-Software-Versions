When ， set , libcurl verifies the OCSP response that a server responds with as part of ， the TLS handshake. It then aborts the TLS negotiation if something is wrong ， with the response. The same feature can be enabled with `-cert-status` using ， the curl tool. ， As part of the OCSP response verification , a client should verify that the ， response is indeed set out for the correct certificate. This step was not ， performed by libcurl when built or told to use OpenSSL as TLS backend. ， This flaw would allow an attacker , who perhaps could have breached a TLS ， server , to provide a fraudulent OCSP response that would appear fine , instead ， of the real one. Like if the original certificate actually has been revoked. ， We are not aware of any exploit of this flaw. ， INFO ， This flaw has existed in curl since commit ，  [ d1cf5d570663d ]  ( https : /github.com/curl/curl/commit/d1cf5d570663d ) in curl ， 7.41.0. ， The vulnerability is present only if OpenSSL is the designated TLS backend. ， OCSP stapling is not enabled by default by libcurl , it needs to be explicitly ， enabled by the application to get used. ， OCSP Stapling can be used with any of the TLS based protocols curl supports ,  ， including HTTPS , FTPS , SMTPS , POP3S , IMAPS , HTTPS-proxy and more. ， The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures ( CVE ) project has assigned the name ， CVE-2020-8286 to this issue. ， CWE-299 : Improper Check for Certificate Revocation ， Severity : Medium ， AFFECTED VERSIONS ， - Affected versions : libcurl 7.41.0 to and including 7.73.0 ， - Not affected versions : libcurl < 7.41.0 and libcurl >= 7.74.0 ， Also note that libcurl is used by many applications , and not always ， advertised as such. ， THE SOLUTION ， The OCSP response checker function now also verifies that the certificate id ， is the correct one. ， A [ fix for CVE-2020-8286 ]  ( https : /github.com/curl/curl/commit/d9d01672785b ) ",
