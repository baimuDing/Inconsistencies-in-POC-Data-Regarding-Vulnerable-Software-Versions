    "text": "Subject : CVE-2017-9148 FreeRADIUS TLS resumption authentication bypass ，  ( erratum )  ， Due to various unfortunate circumstances , mostly related to my own ， sloppiness and stupidity , several \"alternative facts\" made their way ， into the advisory published on May 29 :  ， 1. Reports of EOL versions being vulnerable were greatly exaggerated. ， Only versions 2.1.1 through 2.1.7 are actually vulnerable. Other versions ， allow TLS resumption and skip inner authentication but they change their ， mind and refuse access at the last moment. ( I accept full responsibility ， every single FreeRADIUS release since 2.0.0. )  ， 2. The attribution of the discovery to Stefan Winter was wrong. Further ， inquiry into this matter has revealed the vulnerability was reported ， \"back in February\" but the true identity of a person who reported it ， remains unknown. ( Stefan reported a different problem with session ， resumption in early March and those two issues might have become ， conflated but that is purely my speculation. )  ， Enclosed below is the corrected advisory. The timeline has been extended ， to cover the complete history of the vulnerability. ， Vendor : The FreeRADIUS Project ， Product : FreeRADIUS server ， Affected Versions :  ， 2.x ( EOL )  : 2.1.1 through 2.1.7. ， 3.0.x ( stable )  : All versions before 3.0.14. ， 3.1.x and 4.0.x ( development )  : All versions before 2017-02-04. ， Description :  ， The implementation of TTLS and PEAP in FreeRADIUS skips inner ， authentication when it handles a resumed TLS connection. This is ， a feature but there is a critical catch : the server must never allow ， resumption of a TLS session until its initial connection gets to the point ， where inner authentication has been finished successfully. ， Unfortunately , affected versions of FreeRADIUS fail to reliably prevent ， resumption of unauthenticated sessions unless the TLS session cache is ， disabled completely and allow an attacker ( e.g. a malicious supplicant ) to ， elicit EAP Success without sending any valid credentials.",
