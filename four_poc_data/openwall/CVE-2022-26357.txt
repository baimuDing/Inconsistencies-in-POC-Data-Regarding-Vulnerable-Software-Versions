VT-d hardware may allow for only ， less than 15 bits to hold a domain ID associating a physical device with ， a particular domain. Therefore internally Xen domain IDs are mapped to ， the smaller value range. The cleaning up of the housekeeping structures ， has a race, allowing for VT-d domain IDs to be leaked and flushes to be ， bypassed. ， IMPACT ， The precise impact is system specific, but would typically be a Denial ， of Service (DoS) affecting the entire host. Privilege escalation and ， information leaks cannot be ruled out. ， VULNERABLE SYSTEMS ， Xen versions 4.11 through 4.16 are vulnerable. Xen versions 4.10 and ， earlier are not vulnerable. ， Only x86 systems with VT-d IOMMU hardware are vulnerable. Arm systems ， as well as x86 systems without VT-d hardware or without any IOMMUs in ， use are not vulnerable. ， Only x86 guests which have physical devices passed through to them can ， leverage the vulnerability."
