When cookies that contain ， such control codes are later sent back to an HTTP ( S ) server , it might make the ， server return a 400 response. Effectively allowing a \"sister site\" to deny ， service to siblings. ， We are not aware of any exploit of this flaw. ， INFO ， This flaw in the code was initially introduced in curl 4.9 but HTTP ( S ) servers ， back then did not generally reject requests using control codes so this ， mistake did not actually cause problems until HTTP ( S ) servers started doing ， this much later. Different server implementations of course doing it at ， different times ( with some also still accepting them just fine ) . ， The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures ( CVE ) project has assigned the name ， CVE-2022-35252 to this issue. ， CWE-1286 : Improper Validation of Syntactic Correctness of Input ， Severity : Low ， AFFECTED VERSIONS ， - Affected versions : curl 4.9 to and including 7.84.0 ， - Not affected versions : curl < 4.9 and curl >= 7.85.0 ， libcurl is used by many applications , but not always advertised as such !  ， THE SOLUTION ，  [ fix for CVE-2022-35252 ]  ( https : /github.com/curl/curl/commit/8dfc93e573ca740544a2d79ebb ) ",
