With the ， curl tool , it is enabled with `-referer \" ; auto\"`. ， We are not aware of any exploit of this flaw. ， INFO ， This flaw has existed in libcurl since commit ，  [ f30ffef477 ]  ( https : /github.com/curl/curl/commit/f30ffef477 ) in libcurl 7.1.1 ,  ， released on August 21 , 2000. ， The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures ( CVE ) project has assigned the name ， CVE-2021-22876 to this issue. ， CWE-359 : Exposure of Private Personal Information to an Unauthorized Actor ， Severity : Low ， AFFECTED VERSIONS ， - Affected versions : curl 7.1.1 to and including 7.75.0 ， - Not affected versions : curl < 7.1.1 and curl >= 7.76.0 ， Also note that libcurl is used by many applications , and not always ， advertised as such. ， THE SOLUTION ， If a provided URL contains credentials , they will be blanked out before the ， URL is used to populate the header field. ， A [ fix for CVE-2021-22876 ]  ( https : /github.com/curl/curl/commit/7214288898f5625a6cc196e22a74232eada7861c )  ，  ( The patch URL will change in the final published version of this advisory ) ",
