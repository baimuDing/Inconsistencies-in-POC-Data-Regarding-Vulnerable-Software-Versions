That ， field selects an entry from the active Task State Segment (TSS). ， Since, on AMD hardware, Xen switches to an HVM guest's TSS before ， actually entering the guest, with the Global Interrupt Flag still set, ， the selectors in the IDT entry are switched when guest context is ， loaded/unloaded. ， When a new CPU is brought online, its IDT is copied from CPU0's IDT, ， including those selector fields. If CPU0 happens at that moment to be ， in HVM context, wrong values for those IDT fields would be installed ， belongs to a PV guest, it will then have the ability to escalate its ， privilege or crash the hypervisor. ， IMPACT ， A malicious or buggy x86 PV guest could escalate its privileges or ， crash the hypervisor. ， VULNERABLE SYSTEMS ， All Xen versions from at least 3.2 onwards are vulnerable. Earlier ， versions have not been checked. ， Only PV guests can exploit the vulnerability. HVM guests cannot ， exploit the vulnerability, but their presence is necessary for the ， exposure of the vulnerability to PV guests. ， Only x86 systems using SVM (AMD virtualisation extensions) rather than ， VMX (Intel virtualisation extensions) are vulnerable. Therefore AMD ， x86 hardware is vulnerable; Intel hardware is not vulnerable. ， ARM systems are not vulnerable."
