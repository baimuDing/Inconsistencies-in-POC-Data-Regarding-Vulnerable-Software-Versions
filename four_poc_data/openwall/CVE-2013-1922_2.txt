This could lead to a scenario in ， which after restart of that guest , qemu-nbd would detect the new ， apparent format of the image , including a specified backing file or ， device , which could allow the guest to read any file on the host. ， IMPACT ， qemu-nbd ( qemu-nbd-xen ) is not used by the toolstack software supplied ， with the Xen tree. However , it is built and installed , and so might ， be used by host administrators or by toolstacks other than libxl or ， xend. ， If qemu-nbd is used , a malicious guest administrator may be able to ， read any file on the host , depending exactly how. ， VULNERABLE SYSTEMS ， For Xen systems using libxl ( xl ) or xend ( xm )  : if neither qemu-nbd-xen ， nor qemu-nbd ( since qemu-nbd-xen is installed under the latter name in ， /usr/lib/xen/bin ) is explicitly invoked by scripts or other software ， not supplied by the Xen project , the system is not vulnerable. ， Xen systems using other toolstacks may be vulnerable if those ， toolstacks use qemu-nbd [ -xen ] . ， A guest administrator who runs qemu-nbd-xen by hand on a guest may be ， exposing themselves to this vulnerability. ， Only qemu-xen-upstream is vulnerable ; qemu-xen-traditional has a fix ， which makes this bug not apply. However , the Xen build system builds ， and installs both by default , in some arbitrary order , to the same ， filename. So which is installed and might be used is not predictable ， unless the qemu-xen-upstream build is entirely disabled. ， Only systems with Xen 4.2 and later installed are vulnerable ( by ， virtue of the presence of Xen ) as earlier versions of Xen do not build ， qemu-xen-upstream at all.",
