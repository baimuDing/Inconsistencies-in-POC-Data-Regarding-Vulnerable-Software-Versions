On Intel hardware, ， the logic to turn off hardware acceleration is incomplete and leaves the ， guest with full control of the real Task Priority Register. ， IMPACT ， A malicious or buggy guest may cause a hypervisor crash, resulting in ， a Denial of Service (DoS) affecting the entire host. ， VULNERABLE SYSTEMS ， Xen version 4.8 and onwards are vulnerable. ， Only x86 systems are vulnerable. ARM systems are not vulnerable. ， Only x86 PVH guests can exploit the vulnerability. x86 PV and HVM ， guests cannot exploit the vulnerability."
