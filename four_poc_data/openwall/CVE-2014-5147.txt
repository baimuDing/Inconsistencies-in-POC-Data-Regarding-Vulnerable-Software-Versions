This ， assertion is false when a guest takes a trap from a 32-bit userspace ， running on a 64-bit kernel in a 64-bit domain. ， IMPACT ， Any user in a guest which is running a 64-bit kernel who is able to ， spawn a 32-bit process can crash the host. I.e. an unprivileged guest ， user can cause host-wide denial of service. ， VULNERABLE SYSTEMS ， 32-bit ARM systems and and X86 systems are not vulnerable. ， 64-bit ARM systems which support 32-bit userspace are vulnerable. ， Not all 64-bit ARM CPUs support 32-bit userspace in the actual CPU ， hardware. Systems without that hardware support are not vulnerable. ， Also, not all 64-bit ARM guest kernels have support for 32-bit ， userspace. Systems without that kernel support are vulnerable to a ， malicious guest administrator, but not to an unprivileged guest user."
