I ， can't find any link between them ( e.g. they don't work for the same ， company and reported them as a group )  , so the CVE's are :  ， Piwiki 1.10 XSS Mateusz Goik use CVE-2013-0193 ， Piwiki 1.10 XSS Pawe Hadrzyski use CVE-2013-0194 ， Piwiki 1.10 XSS Artur Czy use CVE-2013-0195 ， Kurt Seifried Red Hat Security Response Team ( SRT )  ， PGP : 0x5E267993 A90B F995 7350 148F 66BF 7554 160D 4553 5E26 7993",
