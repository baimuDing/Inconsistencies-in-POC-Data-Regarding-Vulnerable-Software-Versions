It proceeded ， to destroy the association , even though the user may have ， held the lock and had a ref on the association. ，  [ . ]  ， This was because the sctp_wait_for_connect (  ) would aqcure the socket ， lock and then proceed to release the last reference count on the ， association , thus cause the fully destruction path to finish freeing ， the socket. ， This affects kernels v2.6.11-rc2 and above. ， Thanks , Eugene",
