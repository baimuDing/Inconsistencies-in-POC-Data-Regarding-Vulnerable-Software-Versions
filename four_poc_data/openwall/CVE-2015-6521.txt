See also the second-to-last part of the ， http:/www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2015/08/06/6 post. ， For web applications, file upload is often of interest because the ， attacker can upload a file with an extension recognized by a web ， server as an executable file, e.g., an extension listed on an ， AddHandler line in an Apache HTTP Server configuration. We're not sure ， whether there are any web servers that, in their default ， configuration, have an AddHandler equivalent for all extensionless ， files. Although a web application might want to block uploads of any ， file that has a native executable-file format recognized by the ， underlying operating system, we don't think this is a commonly ， recommended feature, and we don't believe we should be assigning CVE ， IDs to every web application that omits this feature. (We're not ， disputing that the feature could sometimes be useful. Most web ， applications aren't intended to receive native executables through an ， upload mechanism, and there might be attack methodologies that rely on ， these uploads, e.g., uploading something like Staog - ， https:/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staog - to a Linux machine with a ， filename of Staog and no extension.) ， If there is something about a web application that makes native ， executables especially dangerous (e.g., local users are somehow ， encouraged to open all non-PHP files uploaded by web visitors) or if a ， vendor was actually trying to block all native executables but the ， code was wrong, then a CVE ID could exist. ， CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority ， M/S M300 ， 202 Burlington Road, Bedford, MA 01730 USA ， [ PGP key available through http:/cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ]"
