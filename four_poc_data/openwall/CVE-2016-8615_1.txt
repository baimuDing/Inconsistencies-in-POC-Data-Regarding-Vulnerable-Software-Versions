If an invocation of fgets (  ) cannot read the whole line ， into the destination buffer due to it being too small , it truncates the ， output. This way , a very long cookie ( name + value ) sent by a malicious server ， would be stored in the file and subsequently that cookie could be read ， partially and crafted correctly , it could be treated as a different cookie for ， another server. ， We are not aware of any exploit of this flaw. ， INFO ， The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures ( CVE ) project has assigned the name ， CVE-2016-8615 to this issue. ， AFFECTED VERSIONS ， This flaw exists in the following curl versions. ， - Affected versions : curl 7.1 to and including 7.50.3 ， - Not affected versions : curl >= 7.51.0 ， libcurl is used by many applications , but not always advertised as such !  ， THE SOLUTION ， In version 7.51.0 , these functions will deny negative string lengths from ， being used. ， A [ patch for CVE-2016-8615 ]  ( https : /curl.hax.se/CVE-2016-8615.patch ) is ， available.",
