This was a ， surprise to us and to the code. ， libcurl-using applications that allow LDAP URLs , or that allow redirects to ， LDAP URLs could be made to crash by a malicious server. ， We are not aware of any exploit of this flaw. ， INFO ， The bug is only present in curl versions built to use OpenLDAP. ， This bug was introduced in May 2010 in [ this ， commit ]  ( https : /github.com/curl/curl/commit/2e056353b00d09 ) . ， The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures ( CVE ) project has assigned the name ， CVE-2018-1000121 to this issue. ， CWE-476 : NULL Pointer Dereference ， AFFECTED VERSIONS ， - Affected versions : curl 7.21.0 to and including curl 7.58.0 ， - Not affected versions : curl < 7.21.0 and curl >= 7.59.0 ， libcurl is used by many applications , but not always advertised as such. ， THE SOLUTION ， In curl version 7.59.0 , curl checks the pointer properly before using it. ， A [ patch for CVE-2018-1000121 ]  ( https : /curl.hax.se/CVE-2018-1000121.patch ) is available.",
