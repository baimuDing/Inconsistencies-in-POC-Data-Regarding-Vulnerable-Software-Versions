Compared to the version in XSA-150 v4 and earlier, ， this patch is simpler and involves less rearrangement of the code. It ， is therefore thought to be less risky. However, both this version and ， the earlier versions have been tested, and both versions eliminate the ， vulnerability. Readers who have already prepared updates with, and/or ， deployed, the earlier patch, do not necessarily need to update. ， Public release. ， ISSUE DESCRIPTION ， When running an HVM domain in Populate-on-Demand mode, Xen would ， sometimes search the domain for memory to reclaim, in response to ， demands for population of other pages in the same domain. ， This search runs without preemption. The guest can, by suitable ， arrangement of its memory contents, create a situation where this ， search is a time-consuming linear scan of the guest's address space. ， The scan might be triggered by the guest's own actions, or by ， toolstack operations such as migration. In guests affected by ， XSA-153, this scan might be triggered simply by memory pressure in the ， guest. ， Even guests not started in PoD mode can create PoD entries. ， IMPACT ， A malicious HVM guest administrator can cause a denial of service. ， Specifically, prevent use of a physical CPU for a significant period. ， If a host watchdog (Xen or dom0) is in use, this can lead to a ， watchdog timeout and consequently a reboot of the host. If another, ， innocent, guest, is configured with a watchdog, this issue can lead to ， a reboot of such a guest. ， In guests affected by XSA-153, this vulnerability may also be ， triggered by an unprivileged guest user, simply by imposing a workload ， which generates memory pressure. ， VULNERABLE SYSTEMS ， The vulnerability is exposed to any x86 HVM guest. ， ARM is not vulnerable. x86 PV VMs are not vulnerable. ， Versions of Xen from 3.4 onwards are affected."
