The IOMMU configuration for ， these devices which are not properly deassigned ends up pointing to a ， freed data structure , including the IO Pagetables. ， Subsequent DMA or interrupts from the device will have unpredictable ， behaviour , ranging from IOMMU faults to memory corruption. ， IMPACT ， Administrators of guests which have been assigned RMRR-using PCI ， devices can cause denial of service and other problems , possibly ， including escalation of privilege. ， VULNERABLE SYSTEMS ， All versions of Xen from at least 4.4 onwards are vulnerable. ， Only Intel x86 systems are affected. AMD x86 systems , and Arm ， systems , are all unaffected. ， Only systems using PCI passthrough are affected. ( And then , only if ， the assigned devices have RMRRs , but whether a device advertises RMRRs ， is not easy to discern. ) ",
