It is typically specified as [ 1-5 ]  ,  ， specifying the first and the last numbers in the range. Or with [ a-z ]  , using ， letters. ， 1. The curl code for parsing the second * unsigned * number did not check for a ， leading minus character , which allowed a user to specify ` [ 1-1 ] ` with no ， complaints and have the latter `-1` number get turned into the largest ， unsigned long value the system can handle. This would ultimately cause curl to ， write outside the dedicated malloced buffer after no less than 100 , 000 ， iterations , since it would have room for 5 digits but not 6. ， 2. When the range is specified with letters , and the ending letter is left out ， ` [ L- ] ` , the code would still advance its read pointer 5 bytes even if the ， string was just 4 bytes and end up reading outside the given buffer. ， This flaw exists only in the curl tool , not in the libcurl library. ， We are not aware of any exploit of this flaw. ， INFO ， The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures ( CVE ) project has assigned the name ， CVE-2016-8620 to this issue. ， AFFECTED VERSIONS ， This flaw exists in the following curl versions. ， - Affected versions : curl 7.34.0 to and including 7.50.3 ， - Not affected versions : curl < 7.34.0 and curl >= 7.51.0 ， libcurl is used by many applications , but not always advertised as such !  ， THE SOLUTION ， In version 7.51.0 , the function reading data will consider reading a zero size ， to be an error and bail out. ， A [ patch for CVE-2016-8620 ]  ( https : /curl.hax.se/CVE-2016-8620.patch ) is ， available.",
