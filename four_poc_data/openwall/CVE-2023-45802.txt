    "text": "Subject : CVE-2023-45802 : Apache HTTP Server : HTTP/2 stream memory not ， reclaimed right away on RST ， Severity : moderate ， Affected versions :  ， - Apache HTTP Server 2.4.17 through 2.4.57 ， Description :  ， When a HTTP/2 stream was reset ( RST frame ) by a client , there was a time window were the request's memory resources were not reclaimed immediately. Instead , de-allocation was deferred to connection close. A client could send new requests and resets , keeping the connection busy and open and causing the memory footprint to keep on growing. On connection close , all resources were reclaimed , but the process might run out of memory before that. ， This was found by the reporter during testing ofCVE-2023-44487 ( HTTP/2 Rapid Reset Exploit ) with their own test client. During \"normal\" HTTP/2 use , the probability to hit this bug is very low. The kept memory would not become noticeable before the connection closes or times out. ， Users are recommended to upgrade to version 2.4.58 , which fixes the issue.",
