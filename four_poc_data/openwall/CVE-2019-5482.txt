It can call ， `recvfrom (  ) ` with the default size for the buffer rather than with the size ， that was used to allocate it. Thus , the content that might overwrite the heap ， memory is controlled by the server. ， This flaw is only triggered if the TFTP server sends an OACK without the BLKSIZE ， option , when a BLKSIZE smaller than 512 bytes was requested by the TFTP client. ， OACK is a TFTP extension and is not used by all TFTP servers. ， Users choosing a smaller block size than default should be rare as the primary ， use case for changing the size is to make it larger. ， It is rare for users to use TFTP across the Internet. It is most commonly used ， within local networks. TFTP as a protocol is always inherently insecure. ， This issue was introduced by the add of the TFTP BLKSIZE option handling. It ， was previously incompletely fixed by an almost identical issue called ， CVE-2019-5436. ， We are not aware of any exploit of this flaw. ， INFO ， This bug was introduced in January 2009 in [ commit ， 0516ce7786e9500c2e44 ]  ( https : /github.com/curl/curl/commit/0516ce7786e9500c2e44 ) . ， The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures ( CVE ) project has assigned the name ， CVE-2019-5482 to this issue. ， CWE-122 : Heap-based Buffer Overflow ， Severity : 5.2 ( Medium )  ， AFFECTED VERSIONS ， - Affected versions : libcurl >= 7.19.4 to and including 7.65.3 ， - Not affected versions : libcurl < 7.19.4 ， libcurl is used by many applications , but not always advertised as such. ， THE SOLUTION ， A [ fix for CVE-2019-5482 ]  ( https : /github.com/curl/curl/commit/facb0e4662415b5f28163e853dc6742ac5fafb3d ) ",
