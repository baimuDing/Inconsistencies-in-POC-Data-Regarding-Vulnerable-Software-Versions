For the PV emulation path for that instruction the hypervisor ， code didn't check for certain invalid bit combinations , thus exposing ， itself to a fault occurring when invoking that instruction on behalf ， of the guest. ， IMPACT ， Malicious or buggy unprivileged user space can cause the entire host ， to crash. ， VULNERABLE SYSTEMS ， Xen 4.0 and onwards are vulnerable when run on systems with processors ， supporting XSAVE. Only PV guests can exploit the vulnerability. ， In Xen 4.0.2 through 4.0.4 as well as in Xen 4.1.x XSAVE support is ， disabled by default ; therefore systems running these versions are not ， vulnerable unless support is explicitly enabled using the \"xsave\" ， hypervisor command line option. ， Systems using processors not supporting XSAVE are not vulnerable. ， Xen 3.x and earlier are not vulnerable.",
