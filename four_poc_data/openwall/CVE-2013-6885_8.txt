We treated the issue as not publicly ， known because it was not evident from the public sources that this ， erratum constitutes a vulnerability ( particularly , that it was a ， vulnerability in relation to some Xen configurations ) . ， Since then , the fact that this CPU erratum is likely to constitute a ， security problem has been publicly disclosed , on the oss-security ， mailing list. ， Under the circumstances , and in accordance with the Xen Project ， security vulnerability policy , it has been decided that it is no ， longer appropriate to retain the embargo , as the key facts are now in ， the open. ， ISSUE DESCRIPTION ， AMD CPU erratum 793 \"Specific Combination of Writes to Write Combined ， Memory Types and Locked Instructions May Cause Core Hang\" describes a ， situation under which a CPU core may hang. ， IMPACT ， A malicious guest administrator can mount a denial of service attack ， affecting the whole system. ， VULNERABLE SYSTEMS ， The vulnerability is applicable only to family 16h model 00h-0fh AMD ， CPUs. ， Such CPUs running Xen versions 3.3 onwards are vulnerable. We have ， not checked earlier versions of Xen. ， HVM guests can always exploit the vulnerability if it is present. ， PV guests can exploit the vulnerability only if they have been granted ， access to physical device ( s ) . ， Non-AMD CPUs are not vulnerable. ， CREDITS ， This issue's security impact was discovered by Jan Beulich.",
