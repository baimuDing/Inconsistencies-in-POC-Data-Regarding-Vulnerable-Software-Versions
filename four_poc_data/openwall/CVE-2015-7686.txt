We have decided to choose the option ， of a single CVE , although this option is unattractive for some ， reasons. Use CVE-2015-7686 for the CWE-407 ( \"Algorithmic Complexity\" )  ， issue in versions 1.908 and earlier. In other words , we consider 1.908 ， to be an affected version because there are realistic cases in which ， COMMENT_NEST_LEVEL must be 2 for usability reasons. There is no CVE ID ， corresponding to the behavior change between 1.907 and 1.908. ， Looking at the first example from our previous reply :  ， jsmit @ .ine.microsoft.com ( Jan Smith ( MSFT )  ， has a name field of \"Jan Smith\" in level 2 but a name field of \"jsmit\" ， in level 1. However ,  ， jsmit @ .ine.microsoft.com ( Jan Smith )  ， has a name field of \"Jan Smith\" in both level 2 and level 1. The ， documentation for the name instance method says :  ， This method tries very hard to determine the name belonging to the ， address. First the \"phrase\" is checked. If that doesn't work out ， the \"comment\" is looked into. ， The comment field of \" ( Jan Smith ( MSFT ) \" is a real-life example and ， doesn't seem inherently complicated , so we feel that the documented ， \"tries very hard\" behavior is no longer provided if level 1 is used. ， As an example , Email : Address->parse might be used only on the \"From\" ， line to support an application that really , really wants to print :  ， Dear Jan Smith ,  ， Thank you for opening a ticket. ， instead of ， Dear jsmit ,  ， Thank you for opening a ticket. ， It is , of course , not the CVE project's role to offer advice on ， whether to update. In practice , though , if there were a CVE stating ， \"before 1.908\" as the affected versions , then ( because 1.908 exists )  ， many people would update to resolve the CVE. It would fix a ， denial-of-service problem for anyone who is actually attacked , but ， potentially add a usability problem for a much larger population. ， Finally , if anyone is planning to actually fix the CWE-407 issue , note ， that the problem might occur only with a list of addresses , as shown ， in the address-line attachment in the original CVE request. None of ， the four addresses by itself requires much CPU time. ， CVE assignment team , MITRE CVE Numbering Authority ， M/S M300 ， 202 Burlington Road , Bedford , MA 01730 USA ，  [ PGP key available through http : /cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] ",
