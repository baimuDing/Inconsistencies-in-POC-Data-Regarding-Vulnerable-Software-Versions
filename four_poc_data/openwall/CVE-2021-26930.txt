In this process, errors may be encountered. In one case an ， error encountered earlier might be discarded by later processing, ， resulting in the caller assuming successful mapping, and hence ， subsequent operations trying to access space that wasn't mapped. In ， another case internal state would be insufficiently updated, preventing ， safe recovery from the error. ， IMPACT ， A malicious or buggy frontend driver may be able to crash the ， corresponding backend driver, potentially affecting the entire domain ， running the backend driver. In configurations without driver domains ， or similar disaggregation, that is a host-wide denial of sevice. ， Privilege escalation and information leaks cannot be ruled out. ， VULNERABLE SYSTEMS ， Linux versions from at least 3.11 onwards are vulnerable."
