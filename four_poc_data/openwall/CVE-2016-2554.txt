This does not mean ， that a PHP 5.x issue from 71488 has a different CVE ID. )  ， Use CVE-2016-2554 for the issue that was fixed in the 7.0.3 release. ， We understand that this was in the :  ， http : /git.php.net/?p=php-src.git ; a=commit ; h=07c7df68bd68bbe706371fccc77c814ebb335d9e ， commit. This commit has most of the changes that were made in ， ext/phar/tar.c between the 7.0.2 release and the 7.0.3 release. There ， was also a change from \"if ( entry.filename_len = UINT_MAX ) \" to \"if ，  ( entry.filename_len = UINT_MAX | entry.filename_len = 0 ) \" that may ， be unrelated. ， The \"2016-02-01 15 : 01 UTC\" comment in 71488 seems to discuss an ， additional concern. If there is a remaining vulnerability that was not ， fixed in 7.0.3 , that vulnerability is not covered by the CVE-2016-2554 ， ID. ， CVE assignment team , MITRE CVE Numbering Authority ， M/S M300 ， 202 Burlington Road , Bedford , MA 01730 USA ，  [ PGP key available through http : /cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] ",
