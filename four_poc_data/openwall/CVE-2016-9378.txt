This ， check is sometimes erroneously conducted as if the IDT had the format ， then read the wrong part of the IDT and interpret it in an unintended ， manner. (CVE-2016-9377) ， When Xen emulates instructions which generate software interrupts, and ， chooses to deliver the software interrupt, it may try to use the ， method intended for injecting exceptions. This is incorrect, and ， results in a guest crash. (CVE-2016-9378) ， These instructions are not ususally handled by the emulator. ， Exploiting the bug requires ability to force use of the emulator. ， IMPACT ， An unprivileged guest user program may be able to crash the guest. ， VULNERABLE SYSTEMS ， Xen versions 4.5 and newer are vulnerable. Older versions are not ， vulnerable. ， The vulnerability is only exposed on AMD hardware lacking the NRip ， feature. AMD hardware with the NRip feature, and all Intel hardware, ， is not vulnerable. ， Xen prints information about CPU features on boot. If you see this: ， (XEN) SVM: Supported advanced features: ， . ， (XEN) - Next-RIP Saved on #VMEXIT ， then you are not vulnerable because you have an AMD CPU with NRip. ， If you see this: ， (XEN) VMX: Supported advanced features: ， then you are not vulnerable because you have an Intel CPU. ， The vulnerability is only exposed on HVM guests. ， ARM systems are NOT vulnerable."
