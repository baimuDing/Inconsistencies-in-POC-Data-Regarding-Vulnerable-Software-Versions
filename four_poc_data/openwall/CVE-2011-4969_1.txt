This practice seemed ， widespread enough that we decided to modify the selector recognition ， to prevent script injection for the most common case. Any string ， passed to $  (  ) cannot contain HTML tags ( and thus no script ) if it has ， a ? # ? character preceding them. See the ticket linked above for more ， information and a test case. ， Please use CVE-2011-4969 for this issue. ， Kurt Seifried Red Hat Security Response Team ( SRT )  ， PGP : 0x5E267993 A90B F995 7350 148F 66BF 7554 160D 4553 5E26 7993",
