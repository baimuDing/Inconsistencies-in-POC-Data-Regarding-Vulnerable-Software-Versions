This rarely used option is used to send variable=content pairs to ， TELNET servers. ， Due to flaw in the option parser for sending `NEW_ENV` variables , libcurl ， could be made to pass on uninitialized data from a stack based buffer to the ， server. Therefore potentially revealing sensitive internal information to the ， server using a clear-text network protocol. ， This could happen because curl did not call and use sscanf (  ) correctly when ， parsing the string provided by the application. ， The previous curl security vulnerability ，  [ CVE-2021-22898 ]  ( https : /curl.se/docs/CVE-2021-22898.html ) is almost identical ， to this one but the fix was insufficient so this security vulnerability ， remained. ， We are not aware of any exploit of this flaw. ， INFO ， This flaw has existed in curl since commit ，  [ a1d6ad2610 ]  ( https : /github.com/curl/curl/commit/a1d6ad2610 ) in libcurl 7.7 ,  ， released on March 22 , 2001. There was a previous attempt to fix this issue in ， curl 7.77.0 but it was not done proper. ， The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures ( CVE ) project has assigned the name ， CVE-2021-22925 to this issue. ， CWE-457 : Use of Uninitialized Variable ， Severity : Medium ， AFFECTED VERSIONS ， - Affected versions : curl 7.7 to and including 7.77.0 ， - Not affected versions : curl < 7.7 and curl >= 7.78.0 ， Also note that libcurl is used by many applications , and not always advertised ， as such. ， THE SOLUTION ， Use sscanf (  ) properly and only use properly filled-in buffers. ， A [ fix for CVE-2021-22925 ]  ( https : /github.com/curl/curl/commit/894f6ec730597eb243618d33cc84d71add8d6a8a ) ",
