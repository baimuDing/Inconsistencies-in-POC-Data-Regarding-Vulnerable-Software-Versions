If the out of array ， bounds access does not crash , the arbitrary value read will be used if the ， caller reads back the default access through the HVMOP_get_mem_access ， operation , thus causing an information leak. The caller cannot , however ,  ， directly control the address from which to read , since the value read in the ， first step will be used as an array index again in the second step. ， VULNERABLE SYSTEMS ， Only Xen version 4.1 is vulnerable. ， The vulnerability is only exposed to HVM guests.",
