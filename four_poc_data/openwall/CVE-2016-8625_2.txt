Needless to say , those ， host names could very well resolve to different addresses and be two ， completely independent servers. IDNA 2008 is mandatory for .de domains. ， curl is not alone with this problem , as there's currently a big flux in the ， world of network user-agents about which IDNA version to support and use. ， This name problem exists for DNS-using protocols in curl , but only when built ， to use libidn. ， We are not aware of any exploit of this flaw. ， INFO ， The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures ( CVE ) project has assigned the name ， CVE-2016-8625 to this issue. ， AFFECTED VERSIONS ， This flaw exists in the following curl versions. ， - Affected versions : curl 7.12.0 to and including 7.50.3 ， - Not affected versions : curl < 7.12.0 and curl >= 7.51.0 ， libcurl is used by many applications , but not always advertised as such !  ， THE SOLUTION ， In version 7.51.0 , the parser function is fixed. ， A [ patch for CVE-2016-8625 ]  ( https : /curl.hax.se/CVE-2016-8625.patch ) is ， available.",
