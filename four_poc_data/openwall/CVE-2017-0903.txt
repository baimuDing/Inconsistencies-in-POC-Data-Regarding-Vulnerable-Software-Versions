Specially crafted serialized objects can possibly be used to ， escalate to remote code execution. This vulnerability has been assigned the ， CVE identifier CVE-2017-0903. ， Versions Affected : >= 2.0.0. ， Not affected : < 2.0.0 ， Fixed Versions : 2.6.14 ， Impact ， When packaging a Gem , RubyGems will store information about the gem ( the ， \"specification\" ) inside the Gem package , and formatted as YAML. When reading ， Gem information , RubyGems will parse that YAML. Without safeguards , YAML can ， be used to instantiate objects in a target system. If an attacker knows about ， the target system , they can use these instantiated objects as a way to ， escalate to an RCE via other means like `Marshal.load`. ， Normally , a remote code execution flaw isn't a problem in RubyGems because ， RubyGems is designed to execute arbitrary code any time a Gem is installed. ， However , services that process Gems like RubyGems.org can be impacted by this. ， In other words , when used as a client , RubyGems is not impacted. Applications ， that process Gems on the server are impacted. ， Releases ， The FIXED releases are available at the normal locations.",
