The hypercalls attempt to allocate a ， buffer which is 1 larger than this size and is therefore vulnerable to ， integer overflow and an attempt to allocate then access a zero byte ， buffer. ( CVE-2014-1891 )  ， Xen 3.3 through 4.1 , while not affected by the above overflow , have a ， different overflow issue on FLASK_{GET , SET}BOOL ( CVE-2014-1893 ) and ， expose unreasonably large memory allocation to aribitrary guests ，  ( CVE-2014-1892 ) . ， Xen 3.2 ( and presumably earlier ) exhibit both problems with the ， overflow issue being present for more than just the suboperations ， listed above. ( CVE-2014-1894 for the subops not covered above. )  ， The FLASK_GETBOOL op is available to all domains. ， The FLASK_SETBOOL op is only available to domains which are granted ， access via the Flask policy. However the permissions check is ， performed only after running the vulnerable code and the vulnerability ， via this subop is exposed to all domains. ， The FLASK_USER and FLASK_CONTEXT_TO_SID ops are only available to ， domains which are granted access via the Flask policy. ， IMPACT ， Attempting to access the result of a zero byte allocation results in ， a processor fault leading to a denial of service. ， VULNERABLE SYSTEMS ， All Xen versions back to at least 3.2 are vulnerable to this issue when ， built with XSM/Flask support. XSM support is disabled by default and is ， enabled by building with XSM_ENABLE=y. ， We have not checked earlier versions of Xen , but it is likely that ， they are vulnerable to this or related vulnerabilities. ， All Xen versions built with XSM_ENABLE=y are vulnerable.",
