The result ， was that a malicious guest could simply avoid enabling them and ， Well behaved guests would normally enable decoding and therefore would ， not normally suffer a regression. ， Additional patches are now supplied to resolve this issue. ， ISSUE DESCRIPTION ， Guests are currently permitted to modify all of the ( writable ) bits in ， the PCI command register of devices passed through to them. This in ， particular allows them to disable memory and I/O decoding on the ， device unless the device is an SR-IOV virtual function , in which case ， subsequent accesses to the respective MMIO or I/O port ranges would ， - - on PCI Express devices - lead to Unsupported Request responses. The ， treatment of such errors is platform specific. ， IMPACT ， In the event that the platform surfaces aforementioned UR responses as ， Non-Maskable Interrupts , and either the OS is configured to treat NMIs ， as fatal or ( e.g. via ACPI's APEI ) the platform tells the OS to treat ， these errors as fatal , the host would crash , leading to a Denial of ， Service. ， VULNERABLE SYSTEMS ， Xen versions 3.3 and onwards are vulnerable due to supporting PCI ， pass-through. Upstream Linux versions 3.1 and onwards are vulnerable ， due to supporting PCI backend functionality. Other Linux versions as ， well as other OS versions may be vulnerable too. ， Any domain which is given access to a non-SR-IOV virtual function PCI ， Express device can take advantage of this vulnerability.",
