The built-in wildcard function has a flaw that makes it not ， detect the end of the pattern string if it ends with an open bracket ( ` [ ` ) but ， instead it will continue reading the heap beyond the end of the URL buffer ， that holds the wildcard. ， For applications that use HTTP ( S ) URLs , allow libcurl to handle redirects and ， have FTP wildcards enabled , this flaw can be triggered by malicious servers ， that can redirect clients to a URL using such a wildcard pattern. ， We are not aware of any exploit of this flaw. ， INFO ， This bug was introduced in commit ，  [ 0825cd80a62c ]  ( https : /github.com/curl/curl/commit/0825cd80a62c )  , May 2010. ， The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures ( CVE ) project has assigned the name ， CVE-2017-8817 to this issue. ， AFFECTED VERSIONS ， - Affected versions : libcurl 7.21.0 to and including 7.56.1 ， - Not affected versions : libcurl < 7.21.0 and >= 7.57.0 ， curl is used by many applications , but not always advertised as such. ， THE SOLUTION ， In libcurl version 7.57.0 , there's a better check for the end of the ， string. Additionally , the wildcard feature is turned off if the URL passed to ， libcurl is not using FTP ( S )  , so a redirect to an FTP URL cannot trigger ， wildcard functionality. ， A [ patch for CVE-2017-8817 ]  ( https : /curl.hax.se/CVE-2017-8817.patch ) is ， available.",
