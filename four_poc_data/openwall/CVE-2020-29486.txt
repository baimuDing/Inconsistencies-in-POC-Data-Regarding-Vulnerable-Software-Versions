In oxenstored, a owner could ， give a node away. But node ownership has quota implications. ， Any guest can run another guest out of quota, or create an unbounded ， number of nodes owned by dom0, thus running xenstored out of memory ， IMPACT ， A malicious guest administrator can cause denial of service, against a ， specific guest or against the whole host. ， VULNERABLE SYSTEMS ， All systems using oxenstored are vulnerable. Building and using ， oxenstored is the default in the upstream Xen distribution, if the ， Ocaml compiler is available. ， Systems using C xenstored are not vulnerable."
