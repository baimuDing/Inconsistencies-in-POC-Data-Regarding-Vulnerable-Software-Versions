The only ， mentions of the substring \"renegotiate\" in squid-3.5.6.tar.bz2 are :  ， - TLS : Disable client-initiated renegotiation ，  # if defined ( TLSEXT_TYPE_renegotiate )  ， TLSEXT_TYPE_renegotiate ,  ，  # endif ，  # if defined ( SSL3_FLAGS_NO_RENEGOTIATE_CIPHERS )  ， static void ， ssl_info_cb ( const SSL * ssl , int where , int ret )  ，  [ . ]  ，  # endif ， configureSslContext ， . ，  # if defined ( SSL3_FLAGS_NO_RENEGOTIATE_CIPHERS )  ， SSL_CTX_set_info_callback ( sslContext , ssl_info_cb )  ;  ，  # endif ， sslCreateClientContext ， . ，  # if defined ( SSL3_FLAGS_NO_RENEGOTIATE_CIPHERS )  ， SSL_CTX_set_info_callback ( sslContext , ssl_info_cb )  ;  ，  # endif ， The only mention of the substring \"renegotiate\" in squid-3.5.5.tar.bz2 ， is :  ，  # if defined ( TLSEXT_TYPE_renegotiate )  ， TLSEXT_TYPE_renegotiate ,  ，  # endif ， http : /wiki.squid-cache.org/SquidFaq/CompilingSquid doesn't seem to ， mention the change. ， How do these 3.5.6 changes disable anything , or serve as one of two ， \"fixes for two security issues\"? Are you just providing a ( not widely ， documented ) build option so that a repackager or end user could define ， SSL3_FLAGS_NO_RENEGOTIATE_CIPHERS if desired? ， In that situation , we don't believe there should be a CVE ID for the ， official Squid distribution , because the change is about adding ， functionality in the form of a new , non-default option. If a ， repackager decided to build with SSL3_FLAGS_NO_RENEGOTIATE_CIPHERS and ， then announce their 3.5.6 renegotiation change as a required security ， update for their customers , then the repackager could have a CVE ID. ， Second , we don't know what you mean by \"CVE-2009-3555 . was clearly ， assigned for server-initiated renegotiation.\" This statement is ,  ， however , not critical to CVE assignment , so we won't try to start a ， discussion of that. The principal reason that CVE-2009-3555 can't be ， correct is that CVE-2009-3555 isn't about resource-consumption DoS. ， > CVE-2011-1473 which is for the library itself and disputed ， Right , in a case where there should be a CVE ID , we feel that the ， vulnerable product would be specific server-side code , not a ， general-purpose library. ， To conclude , if the position of the Squid developers is that ， client-initiated renegotiation must be denied ( e.g. , because it can ， lead to resource-consumption DoS , and there aren't any supported Squid ， use cases where you feel it's important to let a client renegotiate )  ,  ， and you have changed your code to take this position by default , then ， you can have a CVE ID. Otherwise , we think not. ， CVE assignment team , MITRE CVE Numbering Authority ， M/S M300 ， 202 Burlington Road , Bedford , MA 01730 USA ，  [ PGP key available through http : /cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] ",
