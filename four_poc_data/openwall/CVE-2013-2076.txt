This allows one domain ， to determine portions of the state of floating point instructions of ， other domains. ， NOTE : This is the documented behavior of AMD64 processors , but it is ， inconsistent with Intel processors in a security-relevant fashion that ， was not addressed by the original implementation of XSAVE support on ， Xen. ， This vulnerability is similar to CVE-2006-1056 , concerning ， FXSAVE/FXRSTOR on AMD processors. ， IMPACT ， A malicious domain may be able to leverage this to obtain sensitive ， information such as cryptographic keys from another domain. ， VULNERABLE SYSTEMS ， Xen 4.0 and onwards are vulnerable when run on systems with AMD ， processors supporting XSAVE. Any kind of guest can exploit the ， vulnerability. ， In Xen 4.0.2 through 4.0.4 as well as in Xen 4.1.x XSAVE support is ， disabled by default ; therefore systems running these versions are not ， vulnerable unless support is explicitly enabled using the \"xsave\" ， hypervisor command line option. ， Systems not using AMD processors , or using AMD processors not ， supporting XSAVE ( i.e. families prior to 15h )  , are not vulnerable. ， Xen 3.x and earlier are not vulnerable.",
