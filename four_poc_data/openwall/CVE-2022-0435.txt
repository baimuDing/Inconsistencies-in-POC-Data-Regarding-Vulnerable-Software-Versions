Furthermore, for remote exploitation ， the target would need to have a TIPC bearer set up already i.e. ， vulnerability extends to systems using TIPC. ， Exploitation is trivial and can lead to denial of service via kernel ， panic. In the absence, or bypass, of stack canaries/KASLR the ， vulnerability can lead to control flow hijacking with an arbitrary ， payload. ， The vulnerability has been present since the introduction of the TIPC ， monitoring framework in kernel version 4.8. ， - Introduced: commit 35c55c9877f8 (\"tipc: add neighbor monitoring framework\") ， - Fixed: https:/github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/9aa422ad326634b76309e8ff342c246800621216 ， Analysis ， Transparent Inter Process Communication (TIPC) is an IPC mechanism ， designed for intra-cluster communication. Cluster topology is managed ， around the concept of nodes and the links between these nodes. ， One of the many features of the TIPC module is its monitoring framework. ， Introduced into the kernel in June 2016 (commit 35c55c9), the framework ， allows nodes to monitor network topology and share their view with other ， nodes in the same domain. ， Peer state is tracked via `struct tipc_peer`: ， . ， /* struct tipc_peer: state of a peer node and its domain ， * @addr: tipc node identity of peer ， * @head_map: shows which other nodes currently consider peer 'up' ， * @domain: most recent domain record from peer ， * @hash: position in hashed lookup list ， * @list: position in linked list, in circular ascending order by 'addr' ， * @applied: number of reported domain members applied on this monitor list ， * @is_up: peer is up as seen from this node ， * @is_head: peer is assigned domain head as seen from this node ， * @is_local: peer is in local domain and should be continuously monitored ， * @down_cnt: - numbers of other peers which have reported this on lost ， struct tipc_peer { ， u32 addr; ， struct tipc_mon_domain *domain; ， struct hlist_node hash; ， struct list_head list; ， u8 applied; ， u8 down_cnt; ， bool is_up; ， bool is_head; ， bool is_local; ， }; ， . ， `struct tipc_mon_domain` referends a domain record, used to define that ， peers view of the TIPC topology: ， ."
