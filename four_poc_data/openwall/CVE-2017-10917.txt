Specifically, there is no requirement that a polled event ， channel ports has ever been created. When the code was generalised ， pointers, a check should have been made that these intermediate ， pointers are non-NULL. However, that check was omitted. ， IMPACT ， A malicious or buggy guest may cause the hypervisor to access ， addresses it doesn't control, usually leading to a host crash (Denial ， of Service). Information leaks cannot be excluded. ， VULNERABLE SYSTEMS ， Xen versions 4.4 and newer are vulnerable. Xen versions 4.3 and ， earlier are not affected. ， Both x86 and ARM systems are vulnerable. ， While all guest kinds can cause a Denial of Service, only x86 PV guests ， may be able to leverage the possible information leaks."
