This means that a PV guest can ， create writeable mappings using super page mappings. ， Such writeable mappings can violate Xen intended invariants for pages ， which Xen is supposed to keep read-only. ， This is possible even if the \"allowsuperpage\" command line option is ， not used. ， IMPACT ， Malicious PV guest administrators can escalate privilege so as to ， control the whole system. ， VULNERABLE SYSTEMS ， Xen 3.4 and onward are vulnerable. ， Only x86 systems are vulnerable. ARM systems are not vulnerable. ， Only PV guests can exploit the vulnerability. Both 32-bit and 64-bit ， PV guests can do so."
