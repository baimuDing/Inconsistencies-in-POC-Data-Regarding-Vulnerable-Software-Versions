This is supported because of wording in the [ once proposed ， to-become RFC ， draft ]  ( https : /datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-secsh-scp-sftp-ssh-uri-04 )  ， that was to dictate how SFTP URLs work. ， Due to a bug , the handling of the tilde in SFTP path did however not only ， replace it when it is used stand-alone as the first path element but also ， wrongly when used as a mere prefix in the first element. ， Using a path like `/ ~ 2/foo` when accessing a server using the user `dan` ( with ， home directory `/home/dan` ) would then quite surprisingly access the file ， `/home/dan2/foo`. ， This can be taken advantage of to circumvent filtering or worse. ， We are not aware of any exploit of this flaw. ， INFO ， CVE-2023-27534 was introduced in [ commit ， ba6f20a244 ]  ( https : /github.com/curl/curl/commit/ba6f20a244 )  , shipped in curl ， 7.18.0. ， CWE-22 : Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ， Severity : Low ， AFFECTED VERSIONS ， - Affected versions : curl 7.18.0 to and including 7.88.1 ， - Not affected versions : curl < 7.18.0 and curl >= 8.0.0 ， libcurl is used by many applications , but not always advertised as such !  ， THE SOLUTION ， A [ fix for CVE-2023-27534 ]  ( https : /github.com/curl/curl/commit/4e2b52b5f7a3bf50a ) ",
