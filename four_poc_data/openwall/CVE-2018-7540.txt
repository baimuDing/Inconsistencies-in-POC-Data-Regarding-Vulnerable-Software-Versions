So far this ， in particular included pages pinned to their current type, with the ， necessary unpinning happening implicitly. The unpinning of higher level ， page tables can, however, take a significant amount of time, and hence ， is generally expected to be carried out with intermediate preemption ， checks. Such checks were missing from the code path involved here. ， IMPACT ， A malicious guest administrator can cause a Denial of Service (DoS). ， Specifically, prevent use of a physical CPU for a significant period of ， time. ， VULNERABLE SYSTEMS ， All Xen versions are vulnerable. ， Only x86 systems are affected. ARM systems are not affected. ， Only PV guests can leverage this vulnerability. HVM guests cannot ， leverage this vulnerability."
