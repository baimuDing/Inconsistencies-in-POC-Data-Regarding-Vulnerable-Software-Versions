    "text": "Subject : Multiple Linux setuid output redirection vulnerabilities ， Some of the recent -stable patches are ( surprise !  ) security fixes. ， These were disclosed on the distros list last week. ， CVE-2013-1959 : /proc/<pid>/uid_map has multiple incorrect privilege checks ， Linux 3.8 and various 3.9 rcs are affected , depending on ， configuration. This gives a root shell. ( Actually , it gives a uid 0 ， shell with no capabilities , but that's easy to escalate to full root. )  ， Fixed by :  ， commit 935d8aabd4331f47a89c3e1daa5779d23cf244ee ， Author : Linus Torvalds <torvalds @ .ux-foundation.org> ， Add file_ns_capable (  ) helper function for open-time capability checking ， commit 6708075f104c3c9b04b23336bb0366ca30c3931b ， Author : Eric W. Biederman <ebiederm @ .ssion.com> ， userns : Don't let unprivileged users trick privileged users into ， setting the id_map ， commit e3211c120a85b792978bcb4be7b2886df18d27f0 ， Author : Andy Lutomirski <luto @ .capital.net> ， userns : Check uid_map's opener's fsuid , not the current fsuid ， All three patches are needed. ， There's an exploit at the bottom of this email. To use it , you need ， to supply the program \"zerozeroone\". Doing so is left as an exercise ， to the reader. It can be done on stock installs of Fedora and Ubuntu ， at least. ， CVE-2013-1979 : writes to unix sockets capture euid instead of uid ， This appears to be a regression in 2.6.36 , and the regression was ， backported to various older stable series ( 2.6.35.11 at least ) . It is ， almost certainly exploitable for root on most distributions , although ， the vectors will vary. The fix is :  ， commit 83f1b4ba917db5dc5a061a44b3403ddb6e783494 ， Author : Linus Torvalds <torvalds @ .ux-foundation.org> ， net : fix incorrect credentials passing ， I don't have an exploit , but there's a PoC below that demonstrates the issue. ， There's another security buglet that probably has extremely low ， impact. It doesn't have ( and shouldn't need ) a CVE number. It's ， fixed here :  ， commit 41c21e351e79004dbb4efa4bc14a53a7e0af38c5 ， Author : Andy Lutomirski <luto @ .capital.net> ， userns : Changing any namespace id mappings should require privileges ， - Begin CVE-2013-1959 exploit - ， / * userns_root_sploit.c by * / ， / * Copyright ( c ) 2013 Andrew Lutomirski.
