Specifically the shared ， memory between the frontend and backend can be fetched twice (during ， which time the frontend can alter the contents) possibly leading to ， arbitrary code execution in backend. ， IMPACT ， Malicious guest administrators can cause denial of service. If driver ， domains are not in use, the impact can be a host crash, or privilege escalation. ， VULNERABLE SYSTEMS ， Systems running PV or HVM guests are vulnerable. ， ARM and x86 systems are vulnerable. ， All OSes providing PV backends are susceptible, this includes ， Linux and NetBSD. By default the Linux distributions compile kernels ， with optimizations."
