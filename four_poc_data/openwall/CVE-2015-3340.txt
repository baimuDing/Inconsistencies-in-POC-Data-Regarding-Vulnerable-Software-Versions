ARM systems are not vulnerable. ， The vulnerability is only exposed to service domains with privilege over ， another guest. In a usual configuration that means only device model ， emulators (qemu-dm) when these are running in a separate domain. ， In the case of HVM guests whose device model is running in an ， unrestricted dom0 process, qemu-dm already has the ability to cause ， problems for the whole system. So in that case the vulnerability is ， not applicable. ， This vulnerability is applicable for an HVM guest with a stub qemu-dm. ， That is, where the device model runs in a separate domain (in the case ， of xl, as requested by \"device_model_stubdomain_override=1\" in the xl ， domain configuration file). In this case a guest which has already ， exploited another vulnerability, to gain control of the device model, ， would be able to exercise the information leak. ， However, the security of a system with qemu-dm running in a stub domain ， is still better than with a qemu-dm running as an unrestricted dom0 ， process. Therefore users with these configurations should not switch ， to an unrestricted dom0 qemu-dm. ， Finally, in a radically disaggregated system, where the service domain ， software (probably, the device model domain image in the HVM case) is ， not always supplied by the host administrator, a malicious service ， domain administrator can exercise this vulnerability."
