Use ， CVE-2014-9706 for this vulnerability in dulwich. ， The scope of CVE-2014-9390 is currently undefined, in part because ， http:/cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-9390 ， intentionally doesn't have any related information. Usage of ， CVE-2014-9390 is, very roughly, concerned with \"The string .git/ for a ， directory name has always been considered Very Special. Therefore, ， other strings with equivalence relationships to .git/ must also be ， considered Very Special.\" ， The root cause of the problem in dulwich seems to be \"The string .git/ ， completely distinct conceptually, and is a much simpler case for CVE ， coverage. ， There are two types of concerns with CVE-2014-9390. First, ， CVE-2014-9390 can only apply to omitted equivalence-relationship ， handling in source code that is, or is directly copied from, \"Git ， before 1.8.5.6, 1.9.x before 1.9.5, 2.0.x before 2.0.5, 2.1.x before ， 2.1.4, and 2.2.x before 2.2.1\" source code. It is not possible to have ， a CVE for a cross-implementation vulnerability class of this ， equivalence-relationship handling. Second, usage of CVE-2014-9390 ， seems to span multiple types of problems, possibly including all of: ， http:/cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/178.html ， http:/cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/180.html ， http:/cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/182.html ， CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority ， M/S M300 ， 202 Burlington Road, Bedford, MA 01730 USA ， [ PGP key available through http:/cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ]"
