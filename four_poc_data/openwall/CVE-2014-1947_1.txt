The root cause here is that the code did not cover the case of ， more than 99 layers , which is apparently allowable but relatively ， uncommon. This has a resultant buffer overflow , e.g , L99\\0 is safe but ， L100\\0 is unsafe. When the overflow occurs , it can be described as \"1 ， or more bytes too many.\" ， A new ID of CVE-2014-2030 is now assigned for the vulnerability in ， newer ImageMagick versions that use the \"L%06ld\" string. The root ， cause here is that the code did not recognize the relationship between ， the 8 ( or more ) characters in \"L%06ld\" and the actual buffer size. ， This has a resultant buffer overflow of \"4 or more bytes too many.\" ， CVE assignment team , MITRE CVE Numbering Authority ， M/S M300 ， 202 Burlington Road , Bedford , MA 01730 USA ，  [ PGP key available through http : /cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] ",
