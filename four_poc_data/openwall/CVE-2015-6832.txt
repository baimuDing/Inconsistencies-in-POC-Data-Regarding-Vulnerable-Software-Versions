    "text": "Cc : cve-assign @ .re.org , oss-security @ .ts.openwall.com ， Subject : Re : CVE Request : more php unserializing issues ， -BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE- ， Hash : SHA256 ， The CVE IDs in this message apply to PHP before 5.4.44 , 5.5.x before ， 5.5.28 , and 5.6.x before 5.6.12. ， > These look like they can be exploited for code execution. ， There is related discussion in the ， http : /www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2015/02/05/5 post. The ， essential question is whether there should be a new CVE ID for every ， report where exploitation depends on the attacker's ability to control ， the argument to unserialize. We think these reports are important to ， relatively few people , i.e. , either because their applications don't ， allow arbitrary input to unserialize , or because their applications do ， allow arbitrary input to unserialize and there's already a much ， simpler attack approach available. In other words , in practice , no ， privilege boundary is crossed. However , it's conceivable for an ， application to have constraints on how unserialize is used , such that ， many attacks are blocked , but these remote-code-execution attacks ， involving use-after-free bugs aren't blocked. For example , see some of ， the discussion linked from the ， https : /wiki.php.net/rfc/secure_unserialize page. ， > https : /bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=70166 ， > https : /bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=70155 ( dup )  ， > Use After Free Vulnerability in unserialize (  ) with SPLArrayObject ， > https : /bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=70168 ， > Use After Free Vulnerability in unserialize (  ) with SplObjectStorage ， > https : /bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=70169 ， > Use After Free Vulnerability in unserialize (  ) with SplDoublyLinkedList ， In the current case , we feel it is best to combine a number of ， taoguangchen @ .oud.com discoveries into one CVE. Use CVE-2015-6831 ， > https : /bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=70068 ， > Dangling pointer in the unserialization of ArrayObject items ， > impact : remote code execution ， Use CVE-2015-6832 for this sean.heelan @ .il.com discovery. ， > https : /bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=70019 ， > Files extracted from archive may be placed outside of destination directory ， Use CVE-2015-6833. This seems to be a marginal case in which the issue ， can be interpreted as a security enhancement because the vendor ，  ( 2015-07-08 14 : 30 ) states that the behavior was intended. However , for ， most people , \"Extract the contents of a phar archive to a directory\" ，  ( see the http : /php.net/manual/en/phar.extractto.php page ) probably ， doesn't suggest that an arbitrary set of directories can be chosen by ， the author of the archive. Also , we already have CVE-2008-5658. ， CVE assignment team , MITRE CVE Numbering Authority ， M/S M300 ， 202 Burlington Road , Bedford , MA 01730 USA ，  [ PGP key available through http : /cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] ",
