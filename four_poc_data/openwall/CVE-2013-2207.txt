This ， CVE is about the specific pt_chown finding in the ， PtChownArbitraryPtsAccessViaUserNamespace document. Also, we do not ， want this to be considered an upstream glibc vulnerability. ， (In addition, this CVE is not about whether the pt_chown program ， should exist at all, or about whether all users should be able to ， create user namespaces. Each of those is an important security topic, ， but the importance is a consequence of multiple issues that could be ， associated with multiple CVEs.) ， The initial CVE-2016-2856 description might look roughly like: ， pt_chown in the glibc package before 2.19-18+deb8u4 on Debian ， jessie lacks a namespace check associated with file-descriptor ， passing, which allows local users to capture keystrokes and spoof ， data, and possibly gain privileges, via pts read and write ， operations, related to debian/sysdeps/linux.mk. NOTE: this is not ， considered a vulnerability in the upstream GNU C Library because ， the upstream documentation has a clear security recommendation ， against the -enable-pt_chown option. ， See the ， http:/anonscm.debian.org/cgit/pkg-glibc/glibc.git/commit/?h=jessie&id=09f7764882a81e13e7b5d87d715412283a6ce403 ， and ， http:/anonscm.debian.org/cgit/pkg-glibc/glibc.git/commit/?h=jessie&id=11475c083282c1582c4dd72eecfcb2b7d308c958 ， commits. Here, Debian jessie is just an example; a similar statement ， might be made about Ubuntu Wily Werewolf, etc. The ， 09f7764882a81e13e7b5d87d715412283a6ce403 commit can be associated with ， (at least) two CVE IDs that motivated the change: CVE-2013-2207 (which ， is directly mentioned there) and the new CVE-2016-2856. ， > On the other hand, the TIOCGPTN ioctl still is problematic with ， > USERNS, also for other tools.

We could, for example, ， assign separate CVE IDs to other affected applications (if any) ， instead. ， CVE Assignment Team ， M/S M300, 202 Burlington Road, Bedford, MA 01730 USA ， [ A PGP key is available for encrypted communications at ， http:/cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ]"
