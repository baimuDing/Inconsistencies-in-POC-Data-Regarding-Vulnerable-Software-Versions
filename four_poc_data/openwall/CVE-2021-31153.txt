Its author requested ， a code review for inclusion of the setuid-root binary in openSUSE [2]. ， I reviewed the source of please version 0.3.3 and found multiple ， security issues including a local root exploit (item 1.d) for users that ， are allowed to run a command. You can find the detailed report below. ， # 1) Findings in `please` ， # a) Arbitrary File Existence Test and Arbitrary File Open via `-c`, `-check` ， Arbitrary file existence test and arbitrary file open as root is possible ， via the `-c`, `-check` command line switch. This does not involve an ， information leak but triggers kernel logic not usually available to regular ， users e.g. when sockets or special devices are involved. It also allows the ， setuid-root program to run out-of-memory."
