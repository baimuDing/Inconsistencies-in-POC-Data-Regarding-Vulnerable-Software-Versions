    "text": "Subject : CVE-2022-1419 : Linux kernel : A concurrency use-after-free in vgem_gem_dumb_create ， Hi guys ,  ， I recently discovered a race uaf in the latest 4.19.y kernel ( v4.19.239 ， The root cause of this vulnerability is that the ， ioctl $ DRM_IOCTL_MODE_DESTROY_DUMB can decrease refcount of ，  * drm_vgem_gem_object *  ( created in * vgem_gem_dumb_create *  ) concurrently ,  ， and * vgem_gem_dumb_create * will access the freed drm_vgem_gem_object. ， I noticed that this race issue is fixed in commit 4b848f2 ( drm/vgem : Close ， use-after-free race in vgem_gem_create ) for linux 5.x , so a backport to ， 4.19.y is needed . ， My unstable PoC ( tested on Linux 4.19.239 , it needs the privilege to access ， drm to trigger this bug. ) ",
