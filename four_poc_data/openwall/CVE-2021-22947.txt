Such ， multiple \"pipelined\" responses are cached by curl. curl would then upgrade to ， TLS but not flush the in-queue of cached responses and instead use and trust ， the responses it got * before * the TLS handshake as if they were authenticated. ， Using this flaw , it allows a Man-In-The-Middle attacker to first inject the ， fake responses , then pass-through the TLS traffic from the legitimate server ， and trick curl into sending data back to the user thinking the attacker's ， injected data comes from the TLS-protected server. ， Over POP3 and IMAP an attacker can inject fake response data. ， We are not aware of any case of this flaw having been exploited in the wild. ， INFO ， This flaw was first introduced in commit ，  [ ec3bb8f727405 ]  ( https : /github.com/curl/curl/commit/ec3bb8f727405 ) . ， The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures ( CVE ) project has assigned the name ， CVE-2021-22947 to this issue. ， CWE-349 : Acceptance of Extraneous Untrusted Data With Trusted Data ， Severity : Medium ， AFFECTED VERSIONS ， - Affected versions : curl 7.20.0 to and including 7.78.0 ， - Not affected versions : curl < 7.20.0 and curl >= 7.79.0 ， Also note that libcurl is used by many applications , and not always advertised ， as such. ， THE SOLUTION ， A [ fix for CVE-2021-22947 ]  ( https : /github.com/curl/curl/commit/8ef147c43646e91 ) ",
