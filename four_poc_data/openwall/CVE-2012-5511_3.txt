The patch has ， been updated. The incremental fix can be found at ， http : /lists.xen.org/archives/html/xen-devel/2013-01/msg01193.html ， Mitre have asked that two CVEs are used for the issues described here :  ，  * CVE-2012-5511 now applies only to the stack-based buffer overflow ， that was fixed in 4.2. ，  * CVE-2012-6333 applies to the large input validation issues. ， ISSUE DESCRIPTION ， Several HVM control operations do not check the size of their inputs ， and can tie up a physical CPU for extended periods of time. ， In addition dirty video RAM tracking involves clearing the bitmap ， provided by the domain controlling the guest ( e.g. dom0 or a ， stubdom ) . If the size of that bitmap is overly large , an intermediate ， variable on the hypervisor stack may overflow that stack. ， IMPACT ， A malicious guest administrator can cause Xen to become unresponsive ， or to crash leading in either case to a Denial of Service. ， VULNERABLE SYSTEMS ， All Xen versions from 3.4 onwards are vulnerable. ， However Xen 4.2 and unstable are not vulnerable to the stack ， overflow. Systems running either of these are not vulnerable to the ， crash. ， Version 3.4 , 4.0 and 4.1 are vulnerable to both the stack overflow and ， the physical CPU hang. ， The vulnerability is only exposed to HVM guests.",
