This callback, unlike exception ， handlers, takes 4 extra arguments on the stack (the saved data ， selectors DS, ES, FS, and GS). Prior to placing exception or failsafe ， callback frames on the guest kernel stack, Xen checks the linear ， address range to not overlap with hypervisor space. The range spanned ， by that check was mistakenly not covering these extra 4 slots. ， IMPACT ， A malicious or buggy 64-bit PV guest may be able to modify part of a ， physical memory page not belonging to it, potentially allowing for all ， of privilege escalation, host or other guest crashes, and information ， leaks. ， VULNERABLE SYSTEMS ， 64-bit Xen versions 4.6 and earlier are vulnerable. Xen versions 4.7 ， and later are not vulnerable. ， Only x86 systems are affected. ARM systems are not vulnerable. ， Only x86 systems with physical memory extending to a configuration ， dependent boundary (5Tb or 3.5Tb) may be affected. Whether they are ， actually affected depends on actual physical memory layout. ， The vulnerability is only exposed to 64-bit PV guests. HVM guests and ， 32-bit PV guests can't exploit the vulnerability."
