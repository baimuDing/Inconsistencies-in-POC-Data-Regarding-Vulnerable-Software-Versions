For example , the ability ， of the attacker to use the .php extension , although unusual , does not ， seem to be an entirely separate problem. ， CVE assignment team , MITRE CVE Numbering Authority ， M/S M300 ， 202 Burlington Road , Bedford , MA 01730 USA ，  [ PGP key available through http : /cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] ",
