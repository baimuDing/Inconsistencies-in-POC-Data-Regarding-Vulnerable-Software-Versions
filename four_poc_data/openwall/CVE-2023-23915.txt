This ， HSTS mechanism would however surprisingly fail when multiple transfers are done ， in parallel as the HSTS cache file gets overwritten by the most recently ， completed transfer. ， A later HTTP-only transfer to the earlier host name would then * not * get ， upgraded properly to HSTS. ， Reproducible like this :  ， 1. `curl -hsts hsts.txt -parallel https : /curl.se https : /example.com` ， 2. `curl -hsts hsts.txt http : /curl.se` ， We are not aware of any exploit of this flaw. ， INFO ， This is a curl command line issue and does not affect libcurl. ， This flaw was introduced in [ commit ， 7385610d0c7 ]  ( https : /github.com/curl/curl/commit/7385610d0c7 )  , which was ， shipped enabled by default from [ commit ， d71ff2b9db566b3f ]  ( https : /github.com/curl/curl/commit/d71ff2b9db566b3f ) in ， curl 7.77.0. ， The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures ( CVE ) project has assigned the name ， CVE-2023-23915 to this issue. ， CWE-319 : Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information ， Severity : Low ， AFFECTED VERSIONS ， - Affected versions : curl 7.77.0 to and including 7.87.0 ， - Not affected versions : curl < 7.77.0 and curl >= 7.88.0 ， curl is used by many applications , but not always advertised as such !  ， THE SOLUTION ， 7.88.0 will share the HSTS state properly between transfers , making each ， subsequent save store a complete state. ， A [ fix for CVE-2023-23914 ]  ( https : /github.com/curl/curl/pull/10138 ) ",
