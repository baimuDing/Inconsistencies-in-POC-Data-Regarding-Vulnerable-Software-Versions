Maven is changing the default ， behavior in 3.8.1+ to no longer follow http (non-SSL) repository ， references by default. More details available in the referenced urls. ， If you are currently using a repository manager to govern the ， repositories used by your builds, you are unaffected by the risks ， present in the legacy behavior, and are unaffected by this ， vulnerability and change to default behavior. See this link for more ， information about repository management: ， https:/maven.apache.org/repository-management.html ， This issue is being tracked as MNG-7118"
