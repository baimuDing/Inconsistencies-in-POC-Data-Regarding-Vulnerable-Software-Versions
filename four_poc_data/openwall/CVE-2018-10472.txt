Some of these formats are \"snapshots\" that specify ， \"patches\" to an alternate disk image , whose filename is included in ， the snapshot file. ， When qemu is given a disk but the type is not specified , it attempts ， to guess the file format by reading it. If a disk image is intended ， to be 'raw' , but the image is entirely controlled by an attacker , the ， attacker could write a header to the image , describing one of these ， \"snapshot\" formats , and pointing to an arbitrary file as the \"backing\" ， file. ， When attaching disks via command-line parameters at boot time ，  ( including both \"normal\" disks and CDROMs )  , libxl specifies the ， format ; however , when inserting a CDROM live via QMP , the format was ， not specified. ， IMPACT ， An attacker supplying a crafted CDROM image can read any file ( or ， device node ) on the dom0 filesystem with the permissions of the qemu ， devicemodel process. ( The virtual CDROM device is read-only , so ， no data can be written. )  ， VULNERABLE SYSTEMS ， Only x86 HVM guests with a virtual CDROM device are affected. ARM ， guests , x86 PV guests , x86 PVH guests , and x86 HVM guests without a ， virtual CDROM device are not affected. ， Only systems with qemu running in dom0 are affected ; systems running ， stub domains are not affected. Only systems using qemu-xen ( aka ， \"qemu-upstream\" are affected ; systems running qemu-xen-traditional ， are not affected. ， Only systems in which an attacker can provide a raw CDROM image , and ， cause that image to be virtually inserted while the guest is running ,  ， are affected. Systems which only have host administrator-supplied ， CDROM images , or systems which allow images to be added only at boot ， time , are not affected.",
