Therefore ， it was possible that the IOMMU would read and then use a half-updated ， entry. Furthermore, updates to Device Table entries lacked suitable ， ordering enforcement for certain steps involved in these updates. ， In both case the specific outcome heavily depends on how exactly the ， compiler translated the affected pieces of code. ， IMPACT ， A malicious guest might be able to cause data corruption and data ， leaks. Host or guest Denial of Service (DoS), and privilege ， escalation, cannot be ruled out. ， VULNERABLE SYSTEMS ， All Xen versions are potentially vulnerable. ， Only x86 systems with AMD, Hygon, or compatible IOMMU hardware are ， vulnerable. Arm systems as well as x86 systems with VT-d hardware or ， without any IOMMUs in use are not vulnerable. ， Only x86 guests which have physical devices passed through to them can ， leverage the vulnerability."
