    "text": "Cc : cve-assign @ .re.org , oss-security @ .ts.openwall.com ， Subject : Re : cups-browsed remote exploit ， -BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE- ， Hash : SHA1 ， The vulnerability that remains in cups-filters 1.0.51 ( in the ， generate_local_queue function , the input sanitization also needs to be ， used for the host variable , but wasn't used for that ) is assigned ， CVE-2014-4336. This is fixed in cups-filters 1.0.53. This is the ， vulnerability that exists because of an incomplete fix for ， CVE-2014-2707. ， The second vulnerability addressed in cups-filters 1.0.53 ( OOB ， accesses in the process_browse_data function when reading the packet ， variable , leading to a crash after a remote attack ) is assigned ， CVE-2014-4337. ， For the third vulnerability addressed in cups-filters 1.0.53 :  ， > - cups-browsed : SECURITY FIX : Fix on usage of the ， > \"BrowseAllow\" directive in cups-browsed.conf. Before , if the ， > argument of a \"BrowseAllow\" directive is not understood it ， > is treated as the directive not having been there , allowing ， > any host if this was the only \"BrowseAllow\" directive. Now ， > we treat this as a directive which no host can fulfill , not ， > allowing any host if it was the only one. ， the vendor is announcing it as a security fix , so it is assigned ， CVE-2014-4338. It also seems likely that the previous behavior was ， actually an implementation error. ( Apparently , this only allows ， attacks against systems for which the administrator created a ， malformed configuration file. A vendor could instead choose to have an ， explicit security policy that the product's behavior is undefined in ， the case of a malformed configuration file. )  ， Two additional notes :  ， > This issue was reported as fixed in 1.0.51 :  ， > http : /bzr.linuxfoundation.org/loggerhead/openprinting/cups-filters/revision/7188 ， The code fix itself seems to be ， http : /bzr.linuxfoundation.org/loggerhead/openprinting/cups-filters/revision/7189 ， instead. Also , https : /bugzilla.novell.com/show_bug.cgi?id=871327 ， mentions CVE-2014-2707 , but the attachment in 871327 is apparently ， only the CVE-2014-4336 and CVE-2014-4337 patch , not the CVE-2014-2707 ， patch. However , 871327 isn't directly trying to define what ， CVE-2014-2707 means , so this can be considered a minor anomaly. ， CVE assignment team , MITRE CVE Numbering Authority ， M/S M300 ， 202 Burlington Road , Bedford , MA 01730 USA ，  [ PGP key available through http : /cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] ",
