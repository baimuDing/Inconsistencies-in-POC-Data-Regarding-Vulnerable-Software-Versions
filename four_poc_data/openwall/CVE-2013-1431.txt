    "text": "Subject : CVE-2013-1431 : telepathy-gabble : TLS bypass via use of legacy Jabber ， -BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE- ， Hash : SHA256 ， Maksim Otstavnov reported a vulnerability in the Wocky submodule used by ， telepathy-gabble , an XMPP client implementation for the Telepathy ， framework. A network intermediary could use this vulnerability to bypass ， TLS verification and perform a man-in-the-middle attack. The Debian ， security team has allocated CVE-2013-1431 for this vulnerability. ， This vulnerability is fixed in telepathy-gabble 0.16.6 [ 0 ] . All ， versions since 0.9.x are believed to be vulnerable. The patch ， described below is likely to apply to all affected versions without ， modification. ， If you use an unencrypted connection to a \"legacy Jabber\" ( pre-XMPP )  ， server , fixed versions of telepathy-gabble will not connect to that ， server until you make one of these configuration changes :  ， upgrade the server software to something that supports XMPP 1.0 ; or ， use an encrypted \"old SSL\" connection , typically on port 5223 ，  ( old-ssl )  ; or ， turn off \"Encryption required ( TLS/SSL ) \" ( require-encryption ) . ， Since the vulnerable code is in a git submodule , distributors with ， tarball-based builds for telepathy-gabble will need to apply a patch ， with suitably adjusted paths. A suitable patch [ 1 ] is available from ， the Telepathy bug report [ 2 ] . Distributors who will patch the Wocky ， submodule directly can take the patch from the git commit [ 3 ] . ， In the current development branch , versions 0.17.0 to 0.17.3 are ， vulnerable ; the upcoming 0.17.4 release will fix this vulnerability. ， Regards ,  ， Simon ，  [ 0 ]  ， http : /telepathy.freedesktop.org/releases/telepathy-gabble/telepathy-gabble-0.16.6.tar.gz ， http : /telepathy.freedesktop.org/releases/telepathy-gabble/telepathy-gabble-0.16.6.tar.gz.asc ，  [ 1 ] https : /bugs.freedesktop.org/attachment.cgi?id=79894 ，  [ 2 ] https : /bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=65036 ，  [ 3 ]  ， cgit.freedesktop.org/wocky/commit/?id=ff317a2783058e8e90fac21bd8ba18359c5401f9",
