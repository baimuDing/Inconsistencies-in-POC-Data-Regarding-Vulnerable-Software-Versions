When that response says the data is zero bytes , libcurl would pass ， on that ( non-existing ) data with a pointer and the size ( zero ) to the ， deliver-data function. ， libcurl's deliver-data function treats zero as a magic number and invokes ， strlen (  ) on the data to figure out the length. The strlen (  ) is called on a ， heap based buffer that might not be zero terminated so libcurl might read ， beyond the end of it into whatever memory lies after ( or just crash ) and then ， deliver that to the application as if it was actually downloaded. ， We are not aware of any exploit of this flaw. ， INFO ， This bug was introduced in commit ，  [ ec3bb8f727 ]  ( https : /github.com/curl/curl/commit/ec3bb8f727 )  , December 2009 ,  ， when the initial support for IMAP was introduced. ， The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures ( CVE ) project has assigned the name ， CVE-2017-1000257 to this issue. ， AFFECTED VERSIONS ， - Affected versions : libcurl 7.20.0 to and including 7.56.0 ， - Not affected versions : libcurl < 7.20.0 and >= 7.56.1 ， curl is used by many applications , but not always advertised as such. ， THE SOLUTION ， In libcurl version 7.56.1 , a zero bytes response is not passed on. ， A [ patch for CVE-2017-1000257 ]  ( https : /curl.hax.se/CVE-2017-1000257.patch ) is ， available.",
