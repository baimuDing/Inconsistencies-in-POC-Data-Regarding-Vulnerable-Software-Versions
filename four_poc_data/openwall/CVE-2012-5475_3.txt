So , XSS on a custom web site , or a financial web site that exposes credentials , or a \"typical\" cloud-based offering , would generally not get a CVE. ( Note that this is a gap in the industry , as vulnerability databases in general don't cover \"site-specific\" or service-oriented issues. )  ， Based on the security-announcement-swf-vulnerability-in-yui-2 post , this requires users of YUI 2 to take certain actions for \"Any project that hosts YUI 2 SWF files . on its own servers.\" So , this qualifies for a CVE. ， - Steve ， -Original Message- ， Sent : Monday , November 05 , 2012 3 : 49 PM ， Cc : Reed Loden ; Christey , Steven M. ; security @ .library.com ， Subject : Re :  [ oss-security ] YUI 2.x security issue regarding embedded SWF files - or , How Not To Handle A Security Disclosure ， -BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE- ， Hash : SHA1 ， On 11/04/2012 05 : 13 PM , Kurt Seifried wrote :  ， > On 11/04/2012 01 : 34 PM , Reed Loden wrote :  ， > I haven't seen this posted at all , but it seems there's some ， > ( major? ) security issue regarding the SWF files embedded in YUI ， > 2.
