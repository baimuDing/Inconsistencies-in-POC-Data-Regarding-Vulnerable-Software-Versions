    "text": "Subject : curl : NTLM credentials not-checked for proxy connection re-use ， NTLM credentials not-checked for proxy connection re-use ， Project cURL Security Advisory , January 27th 2016 - ，  [ Permalink ]  ( http : /curl.hax.se/docs/adv_20160127A.html )  ， VULNERABILITY ， libcurl will reuse NTLM-authenticated proxy connections without properly ， making sure that the connection was authenticated with the same credentials as ， set for this transfer. ， libcurl maintains a pool of connections after a transfer has completed. The ， pool of connections is then gone through when a new transfer is requested and ， instead of creating a new one. ， Since NTLM-based authentication is * connection oriented * instead of * request ， oriented * as other HTTP based authentication , it is important that only ， connections that have been authenticated with the correct username + password ， are reused. This was done properly for server connections already , but libcurl ， failed to do it properly for proxy connections using NTLM. ， A libcurl application can easily switch user credentials used for a proxy ， connection between two requests , and that subsequent transfer then MUST make ， libcurl use another connection. libcurl previously failed to do so. ， The effects of this flaw , is that the application could be reusing a proxy ， connection using the previously used credentials and thus it could be given to ， or prevented access from resources that it wasn't intended to. ， This problem is very similar to ，  [ CVE-2014-0015 ]  [ http : /curl.hax.se/docs/adv_20140129.html ]  , which was for ， direct server connections while this is for proxy connections. ， We are not aware of any exploit of this flaw. ， INFO ， This flaw can also affect the curl command line tool if a similar operation ， series is made with that. ， The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures ( CVE ) project has assigned the name ， CVE-2016-0755 to this issue. ， AFFECTED VERSIONS ， This flaw is relevant for ， - Affected versions : libcurl 7.10.7 to and including 7.46.0 ， - Not affected versions : libcurl < 7.10.7 and libcurl >= 7.47.0 ， libcurl is used by many applications , but not always advertised as such !  ， THE SOLUTION ， In version 7.47.0 , libcurl properly verifies the credentials for NTLM proxies ， and only reuses a connection if there there is a match. ， A patch for this problem that changes the default is available at :  ， http : /curl.hax.se/CVE-2016-0755.patch",
