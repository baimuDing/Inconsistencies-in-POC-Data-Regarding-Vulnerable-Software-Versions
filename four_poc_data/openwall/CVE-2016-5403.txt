(This ， requires reusing vring descriptors in more than one request, which is ， incorrect but possible.) Processing a request allocates a ， VirtQueueElement and therefore causes unbounded memory allocation ， controlled by the guest. ， IMPACT ， A malicious guest administrator can cause unbounded memory allocation ， in QEMU, which can cause an Out-of-Memory condition in the domain ， running qemu. ， Thus, a malicious guest administrator can cause a denial of service ， affecting the whole host. ， VULNERABLE SYSTEMS ， ARM systems are not vulnerable. ， PV domains are not vulnerable. ， Only HVM domains where virtio-net devices are provided to the guest ， are vulnerable. Note that NO such devices are provided by default, ， so the default configuration is not vulnerable. ， HVM domains run with QEMU stub domains are not vulnerable. ， (Note that all virtio subsystems are affected; but only virtio-net is ， a supported configuration. See docs/misc/qemu-xen-security.)"
