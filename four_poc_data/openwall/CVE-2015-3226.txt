If this resulting JSON string is subsequently ， inserted directly into an HTML page, the page will be vulnerable to XSS attacks. ， For example, the following code snippet is vulnerable to this attack: ， <%= javascript_tag \"var data = #{user_supplied_data.to_json};\" %> ， Similarly, the following is also vulnerable: ， <script> ， var data = <%= ActiveSupport:JSON.encode(user_supplied_data).html_safe %>; ， </script> ， All applications that renders JSON-encoded strings that contains user-controlled ， data in their views should either upgrade to one of the FIXED versions or use ， the suggested workaround immediately. ， Releases ， The FIXED releases are available at the normal locations."
