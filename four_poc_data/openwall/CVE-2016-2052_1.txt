We ， will also communicate this at ， http : /cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-8947 within ， about a day or two. ， > This means that , if you dont have motivation for investigating the ， > individual issues , it is ok to assign CVEs to multiple unrelated issues? ， > It so , that means everyone is free to do the above mentioned. ， Not everyone is free to do it : the decision belongs to whoever is ， responsible for assigning CVE IDs to that product at that point in ， time. Keep in mind that no one is forcing Google to have a public bug ， report stating \"Update harfbuzz to 1.0.6 . There are a few security ， bugs fixed between 1.0.5 and 1.0.6.\" Google could have decided to ， announce only that \"we occasionally update Chrome's components to the ， latest upstream version for any reason or no reason.\" Because that ， public bug report existed , it gave MITRE the opportunity to put a ， HarfBuzz entry into the CVE corpus. This is presumably of some value ， to other vendors that ship HarfBuzz , even though it is not optimal. ， The information readily available to us was that the product name was ， HarfBuzz , the vulnerable version was 1.0.5 , the fixed version was ， 1.0.6 , and the type of problem was denial of service. Going beyond ， that requires expensive analysis , given that HarfBuzz issue 139 is ， described as \"This in an umbrella issue for setting up regular fuzzing ， earlier portion of this thread indicates that you contributed ， significant analysis effort to report \"i realized that there are ， atleast 3 issues in here which are CVE worthy , \" and yet one of the ， cited issues was about unreleased code that was corrected during the ， development cycle within one day. ， This is not solely a question of whether a third party has motivation ， to do some analysis : it is also a question of whether it is typically ， feasible for third parties to understand everything. Ultimately , it ， would work better if the direct developers of the code recognized ， value in CVE , and made the CVE requests and/or assignments themselves. ， CVE Assignment Team ， M/S M300 , 202 Burlington Road , Bedford , MA 01730 USA ，  [ A PGP key is available for encrypted communications at ， http : /cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] ",
