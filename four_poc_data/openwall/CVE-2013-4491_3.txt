This means we're certain it can't be malicious user submitted data even outside of the scope of a Rails app. ， On Tuesday , December 3 , 2013 8 : 08 : 00 PM UTC+1 , Aaron Patterson wrote :  ， > Reflective XSS Vulnerability in Ruby on Rails ， > There is a vulnerability in the internationalization component of Ruby on Rails.
