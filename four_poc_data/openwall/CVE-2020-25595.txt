While ， devices strictly compliant with PCI specifications shouldn't be able to ， affect these registers, experience shows that it's very common for ， devices to have out-of-spec \"backdoor\" operations which can affect the ， result of these reads. ， IMPACT ， A not fully trusted guest may be able to crash Xen, leading to a Denial ， of Service (DoS) for the entire system. Privilege escalation and ， information leaks cannot be excluded. ， VULNERABLE SYSTEMS ， All versions of Xen supporting PCI passthrough are affected. ， Only x86 systems are vulnerable. Arm systems are not vulnerable. ， Only guests with passed through PCI devices may be able to leverage ， the vulnerability. ， Only systems passing through devices with out-of-spec (\"backdoor\") ， functionality can cause issues. Experience shows that such out-of-spec ， functionality is common; unless you have reason to believe that your ， device does not have such functionality, it's better to assume that it ， does. ， REMINDER OF PCI PASSTHROUGH SUPPORT STATEMENT ， The security team wishes to reiterate our support statement for PCI ， Device Passthrough (found in xen.git/SUPPORT.md): ， \"Because of hardware limitations (affecting any operating system or ， hypervisor), it is generally not safe to use this feature to expose a ， physical device to completely untrusted guests. However, this feature ， can still confer significant security benefit when used to remove ， drivers and backends from domain 0 (i.e., Driver Domains).\" ， The possibility of \"backdoor\" device functionality mentioned above is ， one of the major reasons for this stance. We issue this XSA to help ， maintain Driver Domains as a \"defense-in-depth\", and also on behalf of ， those who may have done full security audits of their particular ， hardware platform. It does not change our stance that passing through ， PCI devices to untrusted guests is in general not safe."
