Codenomicon did not notify ， anyone else than us. We did not notify anyone else but OpenSSL. We did ， request a CVE for \"a critical issue in OpenSSL\" from CERT/CC but did ， not provide them any details at that time. ， On 04/08/2014 11 : 28 PM , Yves-Alexis Perez wrote :  ， > Well , as I put in my tentative timeline , and according to Jussi ， > Eronen ( from NCSC-FI , afaict ) mail in that thread , NCSC-FI only ， > reported to OpenSSL a couple of hours before the advisory , so my ， > understand is that NCSC-FI was not aware of the vulnerability last ， > week.

AFAIK Codenomicon had found the ， vulnerability at around 09.30 EEST on the same day , while developing ， new features to their test tools. We spent a few hours reproducing the ， issue , followed by a couple of days of work on the technical report ， and other preparatory material for the coordination effort , impact ， assessment , etc. ， - -Jussi",
