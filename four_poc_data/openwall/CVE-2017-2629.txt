When ， telling curl to use this feature, it uses that TLS extension to ask for a ， fresh proof of the server's certificate's validity. If the server doesn't ， support the extension, or fails to provide said proof, curl is expected to ， Due to a coding mistake, the code that checks for a test success or failure, ， ends up always thinking there's valid proof, even when there is none or if the ， server doesn't support the TLS extension in question. Contrary to how it used ， to function and contrary to how this feature is documented to work. ， This could lead to users not detecting when a server's certificate goes ， invalid or otherwise be mislead that the server is in a better shape than it ， is in reality. ， This flaw also exists in the command line tool ， ([-cert-status](https:/curl.hax.se/docs/manpage.html#-cert-status). ， We are not aware of any exploit of this flaw. ， INFO ， The mistake happened in a large code merge for the HTTPS proxy feature (commit ， cb4e2be7c6d42ca0780) and went unnoticed primarily because we have no automated ， tests for this feature! ， The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) project has assigned the name ， CVE-2017-2629 to this issue. ， AFFECTED VERSIONS ， curl has supported this option since version 7.41.0. ， This flaw exists in the following curl and libcurl versions. ， - Affected versions: 7.52.0 to and including 7.52.1 ， - Not affected versions: < 7.52.0 and >= 7.53.0 ， libcurl is used by many applications, but not always advertised as such! ， THE SOLUTION ， In version 7.53.0, the actual result of the check is properly used. ， A [patch for CVE-2017-2629](https:/curl.hax.se/CVE-2017-2629.patch) is ， available."
