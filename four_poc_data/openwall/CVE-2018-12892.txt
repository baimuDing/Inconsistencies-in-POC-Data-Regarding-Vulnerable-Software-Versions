IDE disks (\"hd\") are ， not affected (because attempts to make them readonly are rejected). ， Additionally, CDROM devices (that is, devices specified to be ， presented to the guest as CDROMs, regardless of the nature of the ， backing storage on the host) are not affected; they are always ， readonly. ， Only systems using qemu-xen (rather than qemu-xen-traditional) as the ， device model version are vulnerable. ， Only systems using libxl or libxl-based toolstacks are vulnerable. ， (This includes xl, and libvirt with the libxl driver.) ， The vulnerability is present in Xen versions 4.7 and later. ， (In earlier versions, provided that the patch for XSA-142 has been ， applied, attempts to create readonly disks are rejected.) ， If the host and guest together usually support PVHVM, the issue is ， exploitable only if the malicious guest administrator has control of ， the guest kernel or guest kernel command line."
