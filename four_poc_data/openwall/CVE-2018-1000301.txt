We believe this is not a problem for HTTP transfers. ， The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures ( CVE ) project has assigned the name ， CVE-2018-1000301 to this issue. ， CWE-126 : Buffer Over-read ， AFFECTED VERSIONS ， - Affected versions : curl 7.20.0 to and including curl 7.59.0 ， - Not affected versions : curl < 7.20.0 and curl >= 7.60.0 ， libcurl is used by many applications , but not always advertised as such. ， THE SOLUTION ， In curl version 7.60.0 , curl makes sure to restore the pointer back to where ， its supposed to point. ， A [ patch for CVE-2018-1000301 ]  ( https : /curl.hax.se/CVE-2018-1000301.patch ) is ， available.",
