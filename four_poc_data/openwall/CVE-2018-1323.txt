If only a sub-set of the URLs supported by ， Tomcat were exposed via httpd , then it was possible for a specially ， constructed request to expose application functionality through the ， reverse proxy that was not intended for clients accessing the ， application via the reverse proxy. It was also possible in some ， configurations for a specially constructed request to bypass the access ， controls configured in httpd. ， While there is some overlap between this issue and CVE-2018-1323 , they ， are not identical.",
