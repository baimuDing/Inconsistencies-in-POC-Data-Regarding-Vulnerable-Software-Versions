If this happens , an undersized output buffer will be allocated , but the ， full result will be written , thus causing the memory behind the output buffer ， to be overwritten. ， If a username is set directly via `CURLOPT_USERNAME` ( or curl's `-u , -user` ， option )  , this vulnerability can be triggered. The name has to be at least ， 512MB big in a 32bit system. ， Systems with 64 bit versions of the `size_t` type are not affected by this ， issue. ， We are not aware of any exploit of this flaw. ， INFO ， The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures ( CVE ) project has assigned the name ， CVE-2016-8617 to this issue. ， AFFECTED VERSIONS ， This flaw exists in the following curl versions. ， - Affected versions : curl 7.1 to and including 7.50.3 ， - Not affected versions : curl >= 7.51.0 ， libcurl is used by many applications , but not always advertised as such !  ， THE SOLUTION ， In version 7.51.0 , these functions will deny negative string lengths from ， being used. ， A [ patch for CVE-2016-8617 ]  ( https : /curl.hax.se/CVE-2016-8617.patch ) is ， available.",
