Domains with smaller numbers of VCPUs ( e.g. less ， than 16 ) are not able to create sufficient mappings via this method to ， trigger the issue. ， VULNERABLE SYSTEMS ， 32 bit hypervisors running HVM guests on either Intel or AMD are ， vulnerable. ， Only Xen version 4.2.x is vulnerable. ， Nested virtualisation was introduced as an experimental feature in Xen ， 4.2 and therefore versions of Xen prior to that are not vulnerable. ， The 32 bit hypervisor has been removed in Xen unstable and therefore ， is not vulnerable.",
