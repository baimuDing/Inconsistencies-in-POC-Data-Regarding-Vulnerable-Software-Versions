    "text": "Cc : cve-assign @ .re.org , oss-security @ .ts.openwall.com ， Subject : Re : CVE requests : Zend Framework issues fixed in ZF2014-01 and ZF2014-02 ， -BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE- ， Hash : SHA1 ， This is somewhat complex in the sense that all of the issues are ， within the scope of CVE but the disclosures only marginally have ， enough information to determine the correct number of CVE IDs. We did ， not want to combine independent discoveries into the same CVE ID. ， http : /framework.zend.com/security/advisory/ZF2014-01 ， CVE-2014-2681 - This CVE is for the lack of protection against XML ， External Entity injection attacks in some functions , because of the ， incomplete fix in CVE-2012-5657. It appears that this only affects ， Zend Framework 1.x , although that isn't critical to determining the ， number of CVE IDs. ， CVE-2014-2682 - This CVE is for the failure to consider that the ， libxml_disable_entity_loader setting is shared among threads in the ， PHP-FPM case. Again , the existence of this CVE means that the ， CVE-2012-5657 fix was incomplete. It appears that this affects more ， than just Zend Framework 1.x , although that isn't critical to ， determining the number of CVE IDs. ， CVE-2014-2683 - This CVE is for the lack of protection against XML ， Entity Expansion attacks in some functions , because of the incomplete ， fix in CVE-2012-6532. It appears that this also affects more than just ， Zend Framework 1.x , although that isn't critical to determining the ， number of CVE IDs. ， http : /framework.zend.com/security/advisory/ZF2014-02 ， CVE-2014-2684 - This CVE is for the error in the consumer's verify ， method that leads to acceptance of wrongly sourced tokens. The same ， CVE is used for Zend Framework 1.x and ZendOpenId 2.x , even though the ， code is not identical. ， CVE-2014-2685 - This CVE is for the specification violation in which ， signing of a single parameter is incorrectly considered sufficient. ， Again , this CVE is for both Zend Framework 1.x and ZendOpenId 2.x. ， CVE assignment team , MITRE CVE Numbering Authority ， M/S M300 ， 202 Burlington Road , Bedford , MA 01730 USA ，  [ PGP key available through http : /cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] ",
