This might lead ， to a denial-of-service situation or an information disclosure if someone has a ， service that echoes back or uses the trailers for something. ， We are not aware of any exploit of this flaw. ， INFO ， This bug was introduced in commit ，  [ 0761a51ee0551ad9e5 ]  ( https : /github.com/curl/curl/commit/0761a51ee0551ad9e5 )  ,  ， May 11 2016. ， The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures ( CVE ) project has assigned the name ， CVE-2018-1000005 to this issue. ， AFFECTED VERSIONS ， - Affected versions : libcurl 7.49.0 to and including 7.57.0 ， - Not affected versions : libcurl < 7.49.0 and >= 7.58.0 ， libcurl is used by many applications , but not always advertised as such. ， THE SOLUTION ， In libcurl version 7.58.0 , the allocation size is corrected. ， A [ patch for ， CVE-2018-1000005 ]  ( https : /github.com/curl/curl/commit/fa3dbb9a147488a294.patch )  ， is available.",
