Also , it appears that ， introducing '/' characters into strings is a general problem for any ， program that prohibits only '/' characters in user-supplied filenames ，  ( e.g. , because the program , for whatever reason , can only be used on ， UNIX platforms ) . Is there a rationale for not considering this a ， CHICKEN vulnerability? ， CVE assignment team , MITRE CVE Numbering Authority ， M/S M300 ， 202 Burlington Road , Bedford , MA 01730 USA ，  [ PGP key available through http : /cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] ",
