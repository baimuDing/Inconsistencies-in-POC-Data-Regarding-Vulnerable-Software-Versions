The types of information you sent earlier - ， references with vague changelog entries \"Fixed for SQL injection ， vulnerabilities\" and \"Fix SQL injection vulnerabilities\" - are ， normally considered valid reports of open-source vulnerabilities ,  ， e.g. , a person who is neither the discoverer nor the vendor might ， notice such a changelog entry and send it here. However , it is ， somewhat unusual for a discoverer to choose a multi-stage approach in ， which that level of a vague information is provided in one ， oss-security post and full details are sent in a later post. ， Our only suggestion for this case is that , given that the multi-stage ， approach is already in progress , it would probably be best to ， establish a link in at least one direction , e.g. , either :  ， - your full advisory should include a link to ， http : /openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2015/04/14/5 ， so that this previous discussion can be found ， or ， - you should make a later oss-security post in this thread , with a ， link to the public URL ( s ) for your full advisory , which might ， be in any of the four locations that you proposed ， CVE assignment team , MITRE CVE Numbering Authority ， M/S M300 ， 202 Burlington Road , Bedford , MA 01730 USA ，  [ PGP key available through http : /cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] ",
