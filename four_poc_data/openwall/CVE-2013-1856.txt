This could allow an attacker to perform a denial of service attack or gain access to files stored on the application server. This vulnerability has been assigned the CVE identifier CVE-2013-1856. ， Versions Affected: 3.0.0 and All Later Versions when using JRuby ， Not affected: Applications not using JRuby or JRuby applications not using the JDOM backend. ， Fixed Versions: 3.2.13, 3.1.12 ， Impact ， The ActiveSupport XML parsing functionality supports multiple pluggable backends. One backend supported for JRuby users is ActiveSupport:XmlMini_JDOM which makes use of the javax.xml.parsers.DocumentBuilder class. ， In some JVM configurations the default settings of that class can allow an attacker to construct XML which, when parsed, will contain the contents of arbitrary URLs including files from the application server. They may also allow for various denial of service attacks. ， If you are using JRuby and have an affected JVM, you should upgrade or use one of the work arounds immediately. ， Releases ， The 3.2.13 and 3.1.12 releases are available at the normal locations."
