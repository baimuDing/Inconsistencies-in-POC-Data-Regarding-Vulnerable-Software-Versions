De-allocation has to happen when certain constraints are met. ， If these conditions are not met when first checked , the checking CPU ， may send an interrupt to itself , in the expectation that this IRQ will ， be delivered only after the condition preventing the cleanup has ， cleared. For two specific IRQ vectors this expectation was violated ,  ， resulting in a continuous stream of self-interrupts , which renders the ， CPU effectively unusable. ， IMPACT ， A domain with a passed through PCI device can cause lockup of a ， physical CPU , resulting in a Denial of Service ( DoS ) to the entire ， host. ， VULNERABLE SYSTEMS ， Only Xen 4.14 is affected. Xen versions 4.13 and older are not ， affected. ， Only x86 systems are vulnerable. Arm systems are not vulnerable. ， Only guests with physical PCI devices passed through to them can exploit ， the vulnerability.",
