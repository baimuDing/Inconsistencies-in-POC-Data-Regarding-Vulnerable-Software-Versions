    "text": "Subject :  [ CVE-2020-17521 ]  : Apache Groovy Information Disclosure ， CVE-2020-17521 Apache Groovy Information Disclosure ， Severity : Important ， Vendor : The Apache Software Foundation ， Versions Affected :  ， Unsupported Codehaus versions of Groovy from 2.0 to 2.4.4. ， Apache Groovy versions 2.4.4 to 2.4.20 , 2.5.0 to 2.5.13 ,  ， 3.0.0 to 3.0.6 , and 4.0.0-alpha-1. ， Fixed in versions 2.4.21 , 2.5.14 , 3.0.7 , 4.0.0-alpha-2 ， Impact :  ， This vulnerability potentially impacts Unix-like systems , and very old ， versions of Mac OSX and Windows. On such OS versions , Groovy may create ， temporary directories within the OS temporary directory which is shared ， between all users on affected systems. Groovy will create such directories ， of user code via two extension methods [ 4 , 5 ] for creating temporary ， directories. ， If Groovy user code uses either of these extension methods , and stores ， executable code in the resulting temporary directory , then the risk is high ,  ， since this can lead to local privilege escalation. If such Groovy code is ， making ， use of the temporary directory to store sensitive information , then the ， risk is ， medium , since such information could be exposed or modified. ， When analyzing the impact of this vulnerability , here are the important ， questions to ask :  ， Is the Groovy code running on a machine with an impacted operating system? ， Do other users have access to the machine running the Groovy code? ， Does the Groovy code create temporary directories using Groovy's ， createTempDir extension methods [ 4 , 5 ] ? ， If you answer no to any of these questions , you are not affected. ， If you answered yes , does the Groovy code write or store executable code ， in the temporary directory? If you answer yes , the risk is high , and can ， lead to ， local privilege escalation. Does the Groovy code write sensitive ， information ,  ， like API keys or passwords , into the temporary directory? If you answer yes ,  ， the risk is medium , and information may be exposed or modified. ， Description :  ， Groovy was making use of a method in the JDK which is now flagged as not ， suitable for security-sensitive contexts. In addition , Groovy wasn't ， checking ， a flag related to successful creation of the temporary directory which leads ， to a race condition whereby the vulnerability exists [ 1 ] . ， For the fixed versions , Groovy 2.5 and above is now using a newer JDK method ， which creates a directory that is only readable by the user running the ， Groovy ， code. The same is true for the fixed Groovy 2.4 version except if running ， on a pre-JDK7 version of the JDK in which case a fallback implementation is ， used which now checks for successful creation of the temporary directory. ， This eliminates the high-risk scenario involving the race condition whereby ， executables or information could be modified , but still leaves the potential ， to use the `java.io.tmpdir` mitigation.",
