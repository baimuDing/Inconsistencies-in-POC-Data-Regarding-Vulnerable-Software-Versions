    "text": "Subject : CVE-2017-13649 : UnrealIRCd privilege escalation via PID file ， manipulation ， Product : UnrealIRCd ( Unreal IRC daemon )  ， Versions-affected : 4.0.13 and earlier ， Bug-report : https : /bugs.unrealircd.org/view.php?id=4990 ， Author : Michael Orlitzky ， = Summary = ， The unrealircd daemon creates its PID file after dropping ， privileges. This represents a minor security issue when used with a ， traditional SysV-style init script ; additional factors are needed to ， make it exploitable. ， = Details = ， The purpose of the PID file is to hold the PID of the running daemon ,  ， so that later it can be stopped , restarted , or otherwise signalled ，  ( many daemons reload their configurations in response to a SIGHUP ) . ， To fulfill that purpose , the contents of the PID file need to be ， trustworthy. If the PID file is writable by a non-root user , then he ， can replace its contents with the PID of a root process. Afterwards ,  ， any attempt to signal the PID contained in the PID file will instead ， signal a root process chosen by the non-root user ( a vulnerability ) . ， This is commonly exploitable through init scripts that are run as root ， and which blindly trust the contents of their PID files. ， = Exploitation = ， There is only a risk of exploitation when some other user relies on ， the data in the PID file. An example of a problematic scenario ， involving an init script would be ,  ， 1. I run \"/etc/init.d/unrealircd start\" to start the daemon. ， 2. unrealircd drops to the \"unrealircd\" user. ， 3. unrealircd writes its PID file , now owned by the \"unrealircd\" user. ， 4. Someone compromises the daemon. ， 5. The attacker is generally limited in what he can do because the ， daemon doesn't run as root. However , he can write \"1\" into the ， PID file , and he does. ， 6. I run \"/etc/init.d/unrealircd stop\" to stop the daemon while I ， investigate the weird behavior resulting from the hack. ， 7. The machine reboots , because I killed PID 1 ( this is normally ， restricted to root ) .",
