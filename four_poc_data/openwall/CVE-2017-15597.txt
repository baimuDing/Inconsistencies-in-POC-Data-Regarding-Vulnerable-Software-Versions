Other portions of code, ， however, did not match up with that assumption. When such a grant ， copy operation is being done on a grant of a dying domain, the ， assumption turns out wrong. ， IMPACT ， A malicious guest administrator can cause hypervisor memory ， corruption, most likely resulting in host crash and a Denial of ， Service. Privilege escalation and information leaks cannot be ruled ， out. ， VULNERABLE SYSTEMS ， Xen versions from 4.2 onwards are vulnerable. Xen versions 4.1 and ， earlier are not vulnerable. ， Both x86 and ARM are vulnerable, and on x86 both PV and HVM guests can ， trigger the vulnerability."
