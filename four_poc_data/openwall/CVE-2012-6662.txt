We're not sure about ， conventions for changelogs, but it seems potentially misleading to ， just include \"Fixed: XSS in combobox demo. (#8859, 5fee6fd)\" in the ， 1.10.0 changelog anyway. ， A side issue is that 5fee6fd5000072ff32f2d65b6451f39af9e0e39e, by ， itself, only modified the demos/autocomplete/combobox.html file. We ， realize that the demos are shipped in the jquery-ui distribution. ， However, the demos typically wouldn't be part of the deployed product, ， so there's a question of whether combobox.html could have its own ， CVEs. In this case, the question seems largely irrelevant because ， changing the combobox.html code wasn't a useful way to address a ， vulnerability. ， Use CVE-2012-6662 for the issue fixed in ， f2854408cce7e4b7fc6bf8676761904af9c96bde. ， CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority ， M/S M300 ， 202 Burlington Road, Bedford, MA 01730 USA ， [ PGP key available through http:/cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ]"
