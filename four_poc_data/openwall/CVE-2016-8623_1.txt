That funcion however only returns a list with * references * back to ， the original strings for name , value , path and so on. Therefore , if another ， thread quickly takes the lock and frees one of the original cookie structs ， together with its strings , a use-after-free can occur and lead to information ， disclosure. Another thread can also replace the contents of the cookies from ， separate HTTP responses or API calls. ， We are not aware of any exploit of this flaw. ， INFO ， The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures ( CVE ) project has assigned the name ， CVE-2016-8623 to this issue. ， AFFECTED VERSIONS ， This flaw exists in the following curl versions :  ， - Affected versions : curl 7.10.7 to and including 7.50.3 ， - Not affected versions : curl < 7.10.7 and curl >= 7.51.0 ， libcurl is used by many applications , but not always advertised as such !  ， THE SOLUTION ， In version 7.51.0 , the function returning the cookies make deep copies. ， A [ patch for CVE-2016-8623 ]  ( https : /curl.hax.se/CVE-2016-8623.patch ) is ， available.",
