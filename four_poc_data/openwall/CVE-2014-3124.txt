However , only an inadequate subset of ， memory types is excluded. ， There are certain other types that don't correspond to a particular ， valid page , whose page table translation can be inappropriately ， changed ( by HVMOP_set_mem_type ) from not-present ( due to the lack of ， valid memory page ) to present. If this occurs , an invalid translation ， will be established. ， IMPACT ， In a configuration where device models run with limited privilege ( for ， example , stubdom device models )  , a guest attacker who successfully ， finds and exploits an unfixed security flaw in qemu-dm could leverage ， the other flaw into a Denial of Service affecting the whole host. ， In the more general case , in more abstract terms : a malicious ， administrator of a domain privileged with regard to an HVM guest can ， cause Xen to crash leading to a Denial of Service. ， Arbitrary code execution , and therefore privilege escalation , cannot ， be entirely excluded : On a system with a RAM page present immediately ， below the 52-bit address boundary , this would be possible. However ,  ， we are not aware of any systems with such a memory layout. ， VULNERABLE SYSTEMS ， All Xen versions from 4.1 onwards are vulnerable. ， The vulnerability is only exposed to service domains for HVM guests ， which have privilege over the guest. In a usual configuration that ， means only device model emulators ( qemu-dm ) . ， In the case of HVM guests whose device model is running in an ， unrestricted dom0 process , qemu-dm already has the ability to cause ， problems for the whole system. So in that case the vulnerability is ， not applicable. ， The situation is more subtle for an HVM guest with a stub qemu-dm. ， That is , where the device model runs in a separate domain ( in the case ， of xl , as requested by \"device_model_stubdomain_override=1\" in the xl ， domain configuration file ) . The same applies with a qemu-dm in a dom0 ， process subjected to some kind kernel-based process privilege ， limitation ( eg the chroot technique as found in some versions of ， XCP/XenServer ) . ， In those latter situations this issue means that the extra isolation ， does not provide as good a defence ( against denial of service ) as ， intended. That is the essence of this vulnerability. ， However , the security is still better than with a qemu-dm running as ， an unrestricted dom0 process. Therefore users with these ， configurations should not switch to an unrestricted dom0 qemu-dm. ， Finally , in a radically disaggregated system : where the HVM service ， domain software ( probably , the device model domain image ) is not ， always supplied by the host administrator , a malicious service domain ， administrator can exercise this vulnerability.",
