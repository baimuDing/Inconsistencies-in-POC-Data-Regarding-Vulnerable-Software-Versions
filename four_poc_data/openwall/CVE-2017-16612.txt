    "text": "Subject : CVE-2017-16612 libXcursor : heap overflows when parsing malicious ， files ， Hi ,  ， X.Org has just release libXcursor version 1.1.15 which contains the ， following security fix :  ， Author : Tobias Stoeckmann <tobias @ .eckmann.org> ， AuthorCommit : Matthieu Herrb <matthieu @ .rb.eu> ， CommitFix heap overflows when parsing malicious files. ( CVE-2017-16612 )  ， It is possible to trigger heap overflows due to an integer overflow ， The integer overflow occurs because the chosen limit 0x10000 for ， dimensions is too large for 32 bit systems , because each pixel takes ， 4 bytes. Properly chosen values allow an overflow which in turn will ， lead to less allocated memory than needed for subsequent reads. ， The signedness bug is triggered by reading the length of a comment ， as unsigned int , but casting it to int when calling the function ， XcursorCommentCreate. Turning length into a negative value allows the ， check against XCURSOR_COMMENT_MAX_LEN to pass , and the following ， addition of sizeof ( XcursorComment ) + 1 makes it possible to allocate ， less memory than needed for subsequent reads. ， https : /marc.info/?l=freedesktop-xorg-announce&m=151188036018262&w=2 ， Matthieu Herrb ， Download attachment \"signature.asc\" of type \"application/pgp-signature\" ( 820 bytes ) ",
