Use CVE-2015-3988. ， It appears that 1449260 became a public security bug on 2015-05-01 in ， https:/bugs.launchpad.net/horizon/+bug/1449260/comments/6 and then an ， additional attack vector (Host Aggregates) was first mentioned in ， https:/bugs.launchpad.net/horizon/+bug/1449260/comments/10 on ， 2015-05-04. However, there would apparently be no reasonable way to ， independently address only the attack vectors that were identified ， earlier. Also, apparently the completely general description of ， vectors came in from IBM (e.g., \"all the other things that have ， metadata\" in ， https:/bugs.launchpad.net/horizon/+bug/1449260/comments/9 on ， 2015-05-04). Accordingly, it doesn't appear that an additional CVE ID ， could be useful to anyone. ， CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority ， M/S M300 ， 202 Burlington Road, Bedford, MA 01730 USA ， [ PGP key available through http:/cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ]"
