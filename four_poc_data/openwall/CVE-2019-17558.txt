A Velocity template can be provided through ， Velocity ( .vm ) templates in a configset `velocity/` directory or as a ， parameter. A user defined configset could contain renderable , potentially ， malicious , templates. Parameter provided templates are disabled by default ,  ， but can be enabled by setting `params.resource.loader.enabled` by defining ， a response writer with that setting set to `true`. Defining a response ， writer requires configuration API access. ， Solr 8.4 removed the params resource loader entirely , and only enables the ， configset-provided template rendering when the configset is `trusted` ( has ， been uploaded by an authenticated user ) .",
