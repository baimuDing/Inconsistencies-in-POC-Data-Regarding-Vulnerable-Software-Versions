Running PV backends ， in driver domains has one primary security advantage: if a driver domain ， gets compromised, it doesn't have the privileges to take over the ， system. ， However, a malicious driver domain could try to attack other guests via ， sending events at a high frequency leading to a Denial of Service in the ， guest due to trying to service interrupts for elongated amounts of time. ， There are three affected backends: ， * blkfront patch 1, CVE-2021-28711 ， * netfront patch 2, CVE-2021-28712 ， * hvc_xen (console) patch 3, CVE-2021-28713 ， IMPACT ， Potentially malicious PV backends can cause guest DoS due to unhardened ， frontends in the guests, even though this ought to have been prevented by ， containing them within a driver domain. ， VULNERABLE SYSTEMS ， All guests being serviced by potentially malicious backends are vulnerable, ， even if those backends are running in a less privileged environment. The ， vulnerability is not affecting the host, but the guests."
