Because of this ,  ， we published 3 CVEs for consistency with the 2010 outcome :  ， CVE-2012-5881 charts.swf XSS affecting 2.4.0 through 2.9.0 ， CVE-2012-5882 uploader.swf XSS affecting 2.5.0 through 2.9.0 ， CVE-2012-5883 swfstore.swf XSS affecting 2.8.0 through 2.9.0 ， CVE-2012-5475 needed to be rejected in the process :  ， http : /cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2012-5475 ， We don't know why the original URL for the 2010 disclosure isn't ， available with its original content. ( Currently /support/2.8.2/ is a ， 301 redirect to the new ， http : /yuilibrary.com/support/20121030-vulnerability/ web page. ) In ， any case , the web.archive.org URL above has the 2010 data that ， supports the 2010 abstraction choice. ， We'll most likely update CVE-2010-4207 , CVE-2010-4208 , and ， CVE-2010-4209 to delete the old ， CONFIRM : http : /yuilibrary.com/support/2.8.2/ ， reference , and add the new ， CONFIRM : http : /web.archive.org/web/20101028125444/http : /yuilibrary.com/support/2.8.2/ ， reference. We think this is a good idea when a discloser's original ， URL for one vulnerability is suddenly changed to only cover another ， vulnerability. ( We're much less certain that it's a good idea to ， change to a web.archive.org URL , if one exists , in all of the many 404 ， and 403 error cases for other references in other CVEs. )  ， CVE assignment team , MITRE CVE Numbering Authority ， M/S M300 ， 202 Burlington Road , Bedford , MA 01730 USA ，  [ PGP key available through http : /cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] ",
