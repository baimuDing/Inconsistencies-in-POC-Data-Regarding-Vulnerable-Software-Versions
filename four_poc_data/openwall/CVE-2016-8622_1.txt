Internally , even if this function would be made to ， allocate a unscape destination buffer larger than 2GB , it would return that ， new length in a signed 32 bit integer variable , thus the length would get ， either just truncated or both truncated and turned negative. That could then ， lead to libcurl writing outside of its heap based buffer. ， This can be triggered by a user on a 64bit system if the user can send in a ， custom ( very large ) URL to a libcurl using program. ， We are not aware of any exploit of this flaw. ， INFO ， The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures ( CVE ) project has assigned the name ， CVE-2016-8622 to this issue. ， AFFECTED VERSIONS ， This flaw exists in the following curl versions ， - Affected versions : curl 7.24.0 to and including 7.50.3 ， - Not affected versions : curl < 7.24.0 and curl >= 7.51.0 ， libcurl is used by many applications , but not always advertised as such !  ， THE SOLUTION ， In version 7.51.0 , the parser function is fixed. ， A [ patch for CVE-2016-8622 ]  ( https : /curl.hax.se/CVE-2016-8622.patch ) is ， available.",
