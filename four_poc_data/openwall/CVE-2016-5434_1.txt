[ y/N ] .\" ， For example , if there were a signature-verification infinite loop that ， only affected a GUI package manager , without that type of dialog , then ， a CVE ID seems unlikely. First , it's unclear whether there are many ， end users who have the expertise to determine that a loop is related ， to signature verification , but also would jump to the conclusion that ， disabling signature verification was a reasonable solution to their ， immediate problem. More generally , any DoS bug in any package manager ， might trick a non-expert end user into not bothering to install new ， packages , and instead leaving old vulnerable packages installed ， permanently. That is arguably a security impact , but it seems much too ， indirect , so we don't want to assign CVE IDs to 100% of DoS bugs in ， all package managers. ， CVE Assignment Team ， M/S M300 , 202 Burlington Road , Bedford , MA 01730 USA ，  [ A PGP key is available for encrypted communications at ， http : /cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] ",
