In 64-bit Ocaml builds this is fine, but ， in 32-bit builds, it truncates off the most significant bit, and then ， creates unsigned/signed confusion in the remainder. ， This in turn can feed a negative value into logic not expecting a ， negative value, resulting in unexpected exceptions being thrown. ， The unexpected exception is not handled suitably, creating a busy-loop ， trying (and failing) to take the bad packet out of the xenstore ring. ， IMPACT ， A malicious or buggy guest can write a packet into the xenstore ring ， which causes 32-bit builds of oxenstored to busy loop. ， VULNERABLE SYSTEMS ， All versions of Xen are affected. ， Systems running a 32-bit build of oxenstored are affected. ， Systems running a 64-bit build of oxenstored, or systems running (C) ， xenstored are not affected."
