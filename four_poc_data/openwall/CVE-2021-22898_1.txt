This rarely used option is used to send variable=content pairs to ， TELNET servers. ， Due to flaw in the option parser for sending `NEW_ENV` variables , libcurl ， could be made to pass on uninitialized data from a stack based buffer to the ， server. Therefore potentially revealing sensitive internal information to the ， server using a clear-text network protocol. ， This could happen because curl did not check the return code from a ， `sscanf ( command , \"%127 [ ^ ,  ]  , %127s\" ) ` function invoke correctly , and would leave ， the piece of the send buffer uninitialized for the value part if it was ， provided longer than 127 bytes. The buffer used for this is 2048 bytes big and ， the * variable * part of the * variable=content * pairs would be stored correctly ， in the send buffer , making curl sending \"interleaved\" bytes sequences of stack ， contents. A single curl TELNET handshake could then be made to send off a ， total of around 1800 bytes of ( non-contiguous ) stack contents in this style :  ，  [ control byte ] name [ control byte ]  ， stack contents ，  [ control byte ] name [ control byte ]  ， stack contents ， . ， An easy proof of concept command line looks like this :  ， curl telnet : /example.com -tNEW_ENV=a , bbbbbb ( 256 'b's )  ， We are not aware of any exploit of this flaw. ， INFO ， This flaw has existed in curl since commit ，  [ a1d6ad2610 ]  ( https : /github.com/curl/curl/commit/a1d6ad2610 ) in libcurl 7.7 ,  ， released on March 22 , 2001. ， The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures ( CVE ) project has assigned the name ， CVE-2021-22898 to this issue. ， CWE-457 : Use of Uninitialized Variable ， Severity : Medium ， AFFECTED VERSIONS ， - Affected versions : curl 7.7 to and including 7.76.1 ， - Not affected versions : curl < 7.7 and curl >= 7.77.0 ， Also note that libcurl is used by many applications , and not always advertised ， as such. ， THE SOLUTION ， Use sscanf (  ) properly and only use properly filled-in buffers. ， A [ fix for CVE-2021-22898 ]  ( https : /github.com/curl/curl/commit/39ce47f219b09c380b81f89fe54ac586c8db6bde ) ",
