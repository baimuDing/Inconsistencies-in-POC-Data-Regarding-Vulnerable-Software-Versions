Also included proper ( non-obscured )  ， e-mail addresses from upstream patch. ， Removed \"possibly\" from Impact. ， 3 patches updated ， ISSUE DESCRIPTION ， When doing bitblt copy backwards , qemu should negate the blit width. ， This avoids an oob access before the start of video memory. ， IMPACT ， A malicious guest administrator can cause an out of bounds memory ， access , leading to information disclosure or privilege escalation. ， VULNERABLE SYSTEMS ， Versions of qemu shipped with all Xen versions are vulnerable. ， Xen systems running on x86 with HVM guests , with the qemu process ， running in dom0 are vulnerable. ， Only guests provided with the \"cirrus\" emulated video card can exploit ， the vulnerability. The non-default \"stdvga\" emulated video card is ， not vulnerable. ( With xl the emulated video card is controlled by the ， \"stdvga=\" and \"vga=\" domain configuration options. )  ， ARM systems are not vulnerable. Systems using only PV guests are not ， vulnerable. ， For VMs whose qemu process is running in a stub domain , a successful ， attacker will only gain the privileges of that stubdom , which should ， be only over the guest itself. ， Both upstream-based versions of qemu ( device_model_version=\"qemu-xen\" )  ， and `traditional' qemu ( device_model_version=\"qemu-xen-traditional\" )  ， are vulnerable.",
