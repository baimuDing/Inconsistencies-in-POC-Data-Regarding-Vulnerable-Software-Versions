A guest is expected not to modify the ， grant details while it is in use, whereas the guest is free to ， modify/reuse the grant entry when it is not in use. ， Under some circumstances, Xen will clear the status bits too early, ， incorrectly informing the guest that the grant is no longer in use. ， IMPACT ， A guest may prematurely believe that a granted frame is safely private ， again, and reuse it in a way which contains sensitive information, while ， the domain on the far end of the grant is still using the grant. ， VULNERABLE SYSTEMS ， All systems are vulnerable."
