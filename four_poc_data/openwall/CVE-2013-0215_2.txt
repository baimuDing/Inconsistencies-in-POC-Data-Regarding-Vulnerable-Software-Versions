A malicious guest can exploit this to cause oxenstored to read ， past the end of the ring ( and very likely crash ) or to allocate large ， amounts of RAM. ， IMPACT ， A malicious guest administrator can mount a denial of service attack ， affecting domain control and management functions. ， In more detail :  ， A malicious guest administrator can cause oxenstored to crash ; after ， this many host control operations ( for example , starting and stopping ， domains , device hotplug , and some monitoring functions )  , will be ， unavailable. Domains which are already running are not directly ， affected. ， Such an attacker can also cause a memory exhaustion in the domain ， running oxenstored ; often this will make the host's management ， functions unavailable. ， Information leak of control plane data is also theoretically possible. ， VULNERABLE SYSTEMS ， Any system running oxenstored is vulnerable. oxenstored was introduced ， in Xen version 4.1. ， oxenstored was made the default in Xen 4.2.if a suitable ocaml ， toolchain was installed at build time. ， Systems running a 32-bit oxenstored are vulnerable only to the crash ， and not to the large memory allocation issue.",
