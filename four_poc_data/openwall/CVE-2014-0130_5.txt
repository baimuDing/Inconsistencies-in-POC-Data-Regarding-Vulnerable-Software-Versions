    "text": "Cc : oss-security @ .ts.openwall.com , ruby-security-ann @ .glegroups.com ， Subject :  [ CVE-2014-0130 ] Directory Traversal Vulnerability With Certain ， Route Configurations ， There is a vulnerability in the 'implicit render' functionality in Ruby on Rails. This vulnerability has been assigned the CVE identifier CVE-2014-0130. ， Versions Affected : All Supported ， Not affected : None ， Fixed Versions : 4.1.1 , 4.0.5 , 3.2.18 ， Impact ， The implicit render functionality allows controllers to render a template , even if there is no explicit action with the corresponding name. This module does not perform adequate input sanitization which could allow an attacker to use a specially crafted request to retrieve arbitrary files from the rails application server. ， In order to be vulnerable an application must specifically use globbing routes [ 1 ] in combination with the : action parameter. The purpose of the route globbing feature is to allow parameters to contain characters which would otherwise be regarded as separators , for example '/' and '.'. As these characters have semantic meaning within template filenames , it is highly unlikely that applications are deliberately combining these functions. ， To determine if you are vulnerable , search your application's routes files for ' * action' and if you find any , use one of the work arounds below. ， Releases ， The 4.1.1 , 4.0.5 and 3.2.18 releases are available at the normal locations.",
