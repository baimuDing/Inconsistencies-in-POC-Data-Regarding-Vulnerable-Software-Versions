The previous analysis of impacted versions ， was incorrect. ， The same patch is applicable to Xen 4.16 , and the staging-4.16 branch ， has already had the backport applied. ， ISSUE DESCRIPTION ， It has been discovered that on some AMD CPUs , the RAS ( Return Address ， Stack , also called RAP - Return Address Predictor - in some AMD ， documentation , and RSB - Return Stack Buffer - in Intel terminology ) is ， dynamically partitioned between non-idle threads. This allows an ， attacker to control speculative execution on the adjacent thread. ， For more details , see :  ， https : /www.amd.com/en/corporate/product-security/bulletin/amd-sb-1045 ， IMPACT ， An attacker might be able to infer the contents of arbitrary host ， memory , including memory assigned to other guests. ， VULNERABLE SYSTEMS ， Only AMD CPUs are known to be potentially vulnerable. CPUs from other ， hardware vendors are not believed to be impacted. ， Only the Zen1 and Zen2 microarchitectures are believed to be potentially ， vulnerable. Other microarchitectures are not believed to be vulnerable. ， Only configurations with SMT activate are potentially vulnerable. If ， SMT is disabled by the firmware , or at runtime with `smt=0` on Xen's ， command line , then the platform is not vulnerable. ， Xen 4.16 and later contains an optimisation , specifically :  ， c/s afab477fba3b ( \"x86/spec-ctrl : Skip RSB overwriting when safe to do so\" )  ， which in combination with disabling 32bit PV guests ( either at compile ， time with CONFIG_PV32=n , or at runtime with `pv=no-32` on the command ， line ) renders Xen vulnerable to attack from PV guests. ， Note : multiple downstreams are known to have backported this ， optimisation to older versions of Xen. Consult your software vendor ， documentation.",
