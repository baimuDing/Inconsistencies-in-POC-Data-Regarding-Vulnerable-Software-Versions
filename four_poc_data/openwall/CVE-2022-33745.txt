To address ， XSA-401, code was moved inside a function in Xen. This code movement ， missed a variable changing meaning / value between old and new code ， positions. The now wrong use of the variable did lead to a wrong TLB ， flush condition, omitting flushes where such are necessary. ， IMPACT ， The known (observed) impact would be a Denial of Service (DoS) affecting ， the entire host, due to running out of memory. Privilege escalation and ， information leaks cannot be ruled out. ， VULNERABLE SYSTEMS ， All versions of Xen with the XSA-401 fixes applied are vulnerable. ， Only x86 PV guests can trigger this vulnerability, and only when running ， in shadow mode. Shadow mode would be in use when migrating guests or as ， a workaround for XSA-273 (L1TF)."
