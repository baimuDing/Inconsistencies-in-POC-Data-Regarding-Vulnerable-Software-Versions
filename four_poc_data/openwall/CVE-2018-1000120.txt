It then writes a zero byte on that index , in a buffer allocated on the ， heap. ， If the directory part of the URL contains a \"%00\" sequence , the directory ， length might end up shorter than the file name path , making the calculation ， `size_t index = directory_len - filepart_len` end up with a huge index ， variable for where the zero byte gets stored : `heap_buffer [ index ] = 0`. On ， several architectures that huge index will wrap and work as a negative value ,  ， thus overwriting memory * before * the intended heap buffer. ， By using different file part lengths and putting %00 in different places in ， the URL , an attacker that can control what paths a curl-using application uses ， can write that zero byte on different indexes. ， We are not aware of any exploit of this flaw. ， INFO ， This bug was introduced in December 2004 in [ this ， commit ]  ( https : /github.com/curl/curl/commit/6e1e9caa32da0995 ) . ， The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures ( CVE ) project has assigned the name ， CVE-2018-1000120 to this issue. ， CWE-122 : Heap-based Buffer Overflow ， AFFECTED VERSIONS ， - Affected versions : curl 7.12.3 to and including curl 7.58.0 ， - Not affected versions : curl < 7.12.3 and curl >= 7.59.0 ， libcurl is used by many applications , but not always advertised as such. ， THE SOLUTION ， In curl version 7.59.0 , curl rejects FTP URLs that contain any \"control ， characters\". That is byte values below ascii 32. ， A [ patch for CVE-2018-1000120 ]  ( https : /curl.hax.se/CVE-2018-1000120.patch ) is available.",
