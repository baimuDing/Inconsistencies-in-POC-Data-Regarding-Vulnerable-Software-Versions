If PSL support not provided , a ， more rudimentary check exists to at least prevent cookies from being set on ， TLDs. This check was broken if the host name in the URL uses a trailing dot. ， This can allow arbitrary sites to set cookies that then would get sent to a ， different and unrelated site or domain. ， We are not aware of any exploit of this flaw. ， INFO ， This vulnerability only exists when curl is built without ，  [ libpsl ]  ( https : /rockdaboot.github.io/libpsl/ ) . Without this PSL support ， built-in , curl is also destined to possibly leak cookies cross sites simply ， due to how public suffixes work. ， This flaw was introduced in [ commit ， b27ad8e1d3e68e ]  ( https : /github.com/curl/curl/commit/b27ad8e1d3e68e )  , shipped ， in curl 7.82.0 when the treatment of trailing dot host names was changed. ， This flaw is similar to ，  [ CVE-2014-3620 ]  ( https : /curl.se/docs/CVE-2014-3620.html )  , although in 2014 ， curl did not have PSL support. ， The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures ( CVE ) project has assigned the name ， CVE-2022-27779 to this issue. ， CWE-201 : Information Exposure Through Sent Data ， Severity : Medium ， AFFECTED VERSIONS ， - Affected versions : curl 7.82.0 to and including curl 7.83.0 ， - Not affected versions : curl < 7.82.0 and curl >= 7.83.1 ， libcurl is used by many applications , but not always advertised as such !  ， THE SOLUTION ， A [ fix for CVE-2022-27779 ]  ( https : /github.com/curl/curl/commit/7e92d12b4e6911f ) ",
