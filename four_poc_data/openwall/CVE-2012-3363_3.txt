So with this in mind: ， http:/www.magentocommerce.com/download/release_notes ， Release Notes - Magento 1.7.0.1 (Jun 20, 2012) ， Fixed: Several potential security vulnerabilities ， Please use CVE-2012-6091 for these issues. ， But here's a hint: it would only take a few hours to hunt down the ， flaws. And according to the argument \"these sites handle large volumes ， of money\" it would be worth an attackers time to read the diff file, ， so this obscurity argument only hurts the users/admins since they will ， have to waste time figuring out if they need to apply this patch or ， not or if there is a workaround, or what they should do to see if they ， have already been attacked/etc. ， Feel free to post a copy of this on their forums. ， Kurt Seifried Red Hat Security Response Team (SRT) ， PGP: 0x5E267993 A90B F995 7350 148F 66BF 7554 160D 4553 5E26 7993"
