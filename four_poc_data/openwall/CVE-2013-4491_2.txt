Even if I shorten the `call` method to :  ， ` ， key ， end ， ` ， Missing translations are still wrapped in span.missing_translation tag. I have also reported this on github here : https : /github.com/rails/rails/issues/13429 ， Maybe it worth adding a \"default_fallback_locale\" setting so it doesn't raise errors for the missing keys in this locale? ， On Wednesday , December 4 , 2013 2 : 08 : 00 AM UTC+7 , Aaron Patterson wrote :  ， > Reflective XSS Vulnerability in Ruby on Rails ， > There is a vulnerability in the internationalization component of Ruby on Rails.
