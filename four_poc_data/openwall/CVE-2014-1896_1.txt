A ， malicious guest can exploit this to cause a libvchan-using facility to ， read or write past the end of the ring. ， IMPACT ， libvchan-using facilities are vulnerable to denial of service and ， perhaps privilege escalation. ， There are no such services provided in the upstream Xen Project ， codebase. ， VULNERABLE SYSTEMS ， All versions of libvchan are vulnerable. Only installations which use ， libvchan for communication involving untrusted domains are vulnerable. ， libvirt , xapi , xend , libxl and xl do not use libvchan. If your ， installation contains other Xen-related software components it is ， possible that they use libvchan and might be vulnerable. ， Xen versions 4.1 and earlier do not contain libvchan.",
