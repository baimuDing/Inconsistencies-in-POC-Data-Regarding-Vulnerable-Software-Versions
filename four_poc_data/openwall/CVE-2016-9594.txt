Having a weak or virtually non-existent random there makes these ， operations vulnerable. ， This function is brand new in 7.52.0 and is the result of an overhaul to make ， sure libcurl uses strong random as much as possible - provided by the backend ， TLS crypto libraries when present. The faulty function was introduced in [ this ， commit ]  ( https : /github.com/curl/curl/commit/f682156a4fc6c43fb ) . ， We are not aware of any exploit of this flaw. ， INFO ， This mistake managed to slip in because :  ， 1. It wasn't detected by manual code reviews ， 2. When libcurl is built debug-enabled ( which is often the case when libcurl ， developers build it )  , the bug doesn't trigger. ， 3. When built without -g , the test suite's \"valgrind output parser\" wrongly ， ignored the valgrind output and with libcurl's standard build it is ， typically built without -g. Thus hiding this problem to most users. ， The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures ( CVE ) project has assigned the name ， CVE-2016-9594 to this issue. ， AFFECTED VERSIONS ， This flaw exists in the following libcurl versions. ， - Affected versions : libcurl 7.52.0 only ， - Not affected versions : libcurl < 7.52.0 and libcurl >= 7.52.1 ， libcurl is used by many applications , but not always advertised as such !  ， THE SOLUTION ， In version 7.52.1 , we fixed the function and we fixed the valgrind parser in ， the test suite. ， A [ patch for CVE-2016-9594 ]  ( https : /curl.hax.se/CVE-2016-9594.patch ) is ， available.",
