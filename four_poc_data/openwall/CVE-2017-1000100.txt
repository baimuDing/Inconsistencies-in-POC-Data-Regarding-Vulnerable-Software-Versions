This too large value is then used in ， the `sendto (  ) ` call , making curl attempt to send more data than what is ， actually put into the buffer. The `sendto (  ) ` function will then read beyond ， the end of the heap based buffer. ， A malicious HTTP ( S ) server could redirect a vulnerable libcurl-using client to ， a crafted TFTP URL ( if the client hasn't restricted which protocols it allows ， redirects to ) and trick it to send private memory contents to a remote server ， over UDP. Limit curl's redirect protocols with `-proto-redir` and libcurl's ， with `CURLOPT_REDIR_PROTOCOLS`. ， We are not aware of any exploit of this flaw. ， INFO ， This flaw also affects the curl command line tool. ， The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures ( CVE ) project has assigned the name ， CVE-2017-1000100 to this issue. ， AFFECTED VERSIONS ， This bug has been present in curl since TFTP support was added , in September ， 2005 ( commit [ 56d9624b566 ]  ( https : /github.com/curl/curl/commit/56d9624b566 ) . ， - Affected versions : libcurl 7.15.0 to and including 7.54.1 ， - Not affected versions : libcurl < 7.15.0 and >= 7.55.0 ， libcurl is used by many applications , but not always advertised as such. ， THE SOLUTION ， The function now returns error if attempting to send a file name that is too ， long to fit in the TFTP packet. ， A [ patch for CVE-2017-1000100 ]  ( https : /curl.hax.se/CVE-2017-1000100.patch ) is ， available.",
