If the first patch accomplished ， nothing, a total of only one CVE is used. ， Here, it seems that the first patch might help with a situation in ， which the attacker doesn't have complete man-in-the-middle access, but ， the attacker can replace the server. In that case, the attacker ， perhaps can't avoid having the probe connection and the later ， connection go to the same server. Because of that, checking only the ， probe connection might have a security benefit. ， (https:/github.com/transifex/transifex-client/issues/42 says \"MITM ， attacker should be able to steal all transferred data by allowing ， \"probe\" connection opened by verify_ssl to connect to the real ， transifex server and only intercept subsequent urllib2 connection.\") ， Use CVE-2013-7110 for the vulnerability in the \"actual connection used ， to transfer data.\" ， If the above analysis is incorrect, and there are absolutely no cases ， in which the original patch had any security benefit, we will reject ， one of the two CVEs. ， CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority ， M/S M300 ， 202 Burlington Road, Bedford, MA 01730 USA ， [ PGP key available through http:/cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ]"
