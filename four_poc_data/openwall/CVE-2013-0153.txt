This sharing implies that any guest with a passed ， through PCI device that is bus mastering capable can inject interrupts ， into other guests, including domain 0. ， Furthermore, regardless of whether a shared interrupt remapping table ， is in use, old entries are not always cleared, providing opportunities ， (which accumulate over time) for guests to inject interrupts into ， other guests, again including domain 0. ， In a typical Xen system many devices are owned by domain 0 or driver ， domains, leaving them vulnerable to such an attack. Such a DoS is ， likely to have an impact on other guests running in the system. ， IMPACT ， A malicious domain which is given access to a physical PCI device can ， mount a denial of service attack affecting the whole system. ， VULNERABLE SYSTEMS ， Xen versions 3.3 onwards are vulnerable. Earlier Xen versions do not ， implement interrupt remapping, and hence do not support secure AMD-Vi ， PCI passthrough in any case. ， Only systems using AMD-Vi for PCI passthrough are vulnerable. ， Any domain which is given access to a PCI device can take advantage of ， this vulnerability."
