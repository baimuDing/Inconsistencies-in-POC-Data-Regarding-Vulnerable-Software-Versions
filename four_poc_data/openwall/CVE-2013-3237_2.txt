See for ， example \"Attendees agreed that CVE should include problems in beta ， software , provided that the beta code was intended for public ， dissemination\" in the ， http : /cve.mitre.org/data/board/archives/2000-03/msg00007.html post. ， These CVEs tend to be rare , possibly because they are useful to fewer ， people. Recent examples in which a major vendor specifically chose to ， assign a CVE name to an issue affecting only beta software are :  ， CVE-2009-2968 - VMware Studio 2.0 public beta ， CVE-2010-0113 - Symantec Norton Mobile Security 1.0 Beta ， A few months ago , MITRE started to draft some rough guidelines for a ， case of a vendor who was considering use of CVEs during beta testing. ， That case seems mostly inapplicable to the current question ，  ( CVE-2013-3236 , CVE-2013-3237 , etc. weren't in any sense based on ， \"vendor\" requests )  , but we might be able to share guidelines at some ， point if any vendor here is in a similar position. ， CVE assignment team , MITRE CVE Numbering Authority ， M/S M300 ， 202 Burlington Road , Bedford , MA 01730 USA ，  [ PGP key available through http : /cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ] ",
