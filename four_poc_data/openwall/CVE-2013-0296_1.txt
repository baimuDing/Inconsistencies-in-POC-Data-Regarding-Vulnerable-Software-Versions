    "text": "Cc : Michael Tokarev <mjt @ .msk.ru> ， Subject : Re : CVE # request : pigz creates temp file with insecure permissions ， This was reported to and corrected by the pigz maintainer on 7/26/12 , per :  ， Jim Mellander <jmellander @ .gov> ， 7/26/12 ， to madler , pigz-announce-. ， Hi :  ， I recently downloaded and tried pigz - thanks for the software - its ， very useful for multicore systems , especially on the big iron that ， NERSC runs. However , there seems to be a security hole , relating to ， permissions during compression. The permissions of the .gz file being ， created are less restrictive than the original file , which is ， different than gzip , per the below :  ， using gzip :  ，  # gzip -9 x & ，  [ 1 ] 17014 ，  # ls -l x *  ， -rw-. 1 root root 1217318912 Jul 26 12 : 34 x ， -rw-. 1 root root 63602688 Jul 26 12 : 47 x.gz ， using pigz :  ，  # pigz -9 x& ，  [ 1 ] 17017 ，  # ls -l x *  ， -rw-. 1 root root 1217318912 Jul 26 12 : 34 x ， -rw-r-r-. 1 root root 75392287 Jul 26 12 : 48 x.gz ，  # pigz -version ， pigz 2.2.4 ， the file contents are potentially exposed during compression due to ， permissions , which is a potential security hole. ， Hope this helps ,  ， Jim Mellander ， NERSC Cybersecurity ， 510-486-7204 ， On Fri , Feb 15 , 2013 at 10 : 33 PM , Kurt Seifried <kseifried @ .hat.com> wrote :  ， > -BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE- ， > Hash : SHA1 ， > On 02/15/2013 01 : 33 AM , Michael Tokarev wrote :  ， > I think this one well deserves a CVE # .
