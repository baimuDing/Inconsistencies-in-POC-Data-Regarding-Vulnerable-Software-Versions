In a serial or ， parallel manner. ， If one of the servers hosting the contents has been breached and the contents ， of the specific file on that server is replaced with a modified payload , curl ， should detect this when the hash of the file mismatches after a completed ， download. It should remove the contents and instead try getting the contents ， mentioned in text and the potentially malicious content is kept in the file on ， disk. ， There's a risk the user doesn't notice the message and instead assumes the ， file is fine. ， We are not aware of any exploit of this flaw. ， INFO ， This flaw exists only in the curl tool. libcurl is not affected. ， This flaw has existed in curl since commit ，  [ b5fdbe848bc3d ]  ( https : /github.com/curl/curl/commit/b5fdbe848bc3d ) in curl ， 7.27.0 , released on July 27 , 2012. ， The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures ( CVE ) project has assigned the name ， CVE-2021-22922 to this issue. ， CWE-20 : Improper Input Validation ， Severity : Medium ， AFFECTED VERSIONS ， - Affected versions : curl 7.27.0 to and including 7.77.0 ， - Not affected versions : curl < 7.27.0 and curl >= 7.78.0 ， THE SOLUTION ， curl has completely removed the metalink feature as of 7.78.0. No fix for this ， flaw will be produced by the curl project. ， The fix for earlier versions is to rebuild curl with the metalink support ， switched off ! ",
