When large pages are in use to map ， guest pages in the 2nd-stage page tables, such a removal operation may ， incur a memory allocation (to replace a large mapping with individual ， smaller ones). If this allocation fails, these errors are ignored by ， the callers, which would then continue and (for example) free the ， referenced page for reuse. This leaves the guest with a mapping to a ， page it shouldn't have access to. ， The allocation involved comes from a separate pool of memory created ， when the domain is created; under normal operating conditions it never ， fails, but a malicious guest may be able to engineer situations where ， this pool is exhausted. ， IMPACT ， A malicious guest may be able to access memory it doesn't own, ， potentially allowing privilege escalation, host crashes, or ， information leakage. ， VULNERABLE SYSTEMS ， Xen versions from at least 3.2 onwards are vulnerable. Older versions ， have not been inspected. ， Both x86 and ARM systems are vulnerable. ， On x86 systems, only HVM guests can leverage the vulnerability."
