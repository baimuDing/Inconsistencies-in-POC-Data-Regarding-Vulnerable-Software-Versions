The `-no-clobber` ， option prevents curl from overwriting a file if it already exists , and instead ， appends a number to the name to create a new unused file name. ， If curl adds a number to not \"clobber\" the output and an error occurs during ， transfer , the remove on error logic would remove the * original * file name ， without the added number. ， We are not aware of any exploit of this flaw. ， INFO ， This flaw is only present in the command line tool , not the library. ， This flaw was introduced in curl 7.83.0 with the addition of these two options ， that together created this problem. Since both these command line options are ， brand new in this version , chances are not too many users have actually had ， time to experience this problem. ， The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures ( CVE ) project has assigned the name ， CVE-2022-27778 to this issue. ， CWE-706 : Use of Incorrectly-Resolved Name or Reference ， Severity : Medium ， AFFECTED VERSIONS ， - Affected versions : curl 7.83.0 ， - Not affected versions : curl < 7.83.0 and curl >= 7.83.1 ， THE SOLUTION ， A [ fix for CVE-2022-27778 ]  ( https : /github.com/curl/curl/commit/8c7ee9083d0d71 ) ",
