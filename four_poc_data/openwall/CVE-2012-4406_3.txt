    "text": "Subject : Good news and bad news on Python sockets and pickle ， -BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE- ， Hash : SHA1 ， So first the good news , I looked at the top projects on pypi ，  ( arbitrarily defined as more than 1000 downloads in the last month for ， at least one version )  , so for the most recent version of these that ， meant about 8 , 072 packages. ， I looked for cases where pickle.loads is used on untrusted data , the ， good news is didn't find many , the main two uses cases were taking ， data from zeroMQ and memcached and then unpickling it , looks like ， those would be compromised in any event if malicious data got in ， there , let alone RCE type stuff. ， However having said that we do have this one in the past :  ， CVE-2012-4406 OpenStack Object Storage ( swift ) before 1.7.0 uses the ， loads function in the pickle Python module unsafely when storing and ， loading metadata in memcached , which allows remote attackers to ， execute arbitrary code via a crafted pickle object. ， So here is my question , is all pickle.loads from things like memcached ，  ( which has no auth ) generally CVE worthy? If so I can post a list of ， the potentials , I'll be honest , I'm to lazy to go digging through it ，  ( I'm not sure how many uses shared/public memcached configs/etc. ) . ， Kurt Seifried - Red Hat - Product Security - Cloud ， PGP A90B F995 7350 148F 66BF 7554 160D 4553 5E26 7993",
