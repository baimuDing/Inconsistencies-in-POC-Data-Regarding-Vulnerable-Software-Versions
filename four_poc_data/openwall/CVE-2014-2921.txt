CVE's practice here is to assign two different IDs: ， 1.4.9 to 2.0.0: Zend_Pdf_ElementFactory_Proxy = CVE-2014-2921 ， 1.4.9 to 2.1.0: Zend_Http_Response_Stream = CVE-2014-2922 ， The impacts are also different but a difference in impact does not, by ， itself, affect the number of CVE IDs. The detailed reason for why ， there are different sets of affected versions (e.g., a code change in ， 2.0.1 to enforce use of certain PHP versions, with some PHP versions ， not allowing a malicious.php\\0 filename) also does not affect the ， number of CVE IDs in this case. ， Each CVE depends on the unserialize problem in the context of whether ， the version-enforcement code is present or absent. ， CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority ， M/S M300 ， 202 Burlington Road, Bedford, MA 01730 USA ， [ PGP key available through http:/cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ]"
