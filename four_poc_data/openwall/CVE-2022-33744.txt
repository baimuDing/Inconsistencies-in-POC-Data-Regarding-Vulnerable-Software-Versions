These inconsistencies can lead to Denial of Service (DoS) of ， dom0, e.g. by causing crashes or the inability to perform further ， mappings of other guests' memory pages. ， IMPACT ， A guest performing multiple I/Os of PV devices in parallel can cause ， DoS of dom0 and thus of the complete host. ， VULNERABLE SYSTEMS ， Only Arm systems (32-bit and 64-bit) are vulnerable. Dom0 Linux versions ， 3.13 - 5.18 are vulnerable. ， X86 systems are not vulnerable."
