The number of acceptable \"links\" in this \"decompression chain\" was ， capped , but the cap was implemented on a per-header basis allowing a malicious ， server to insert a virtually unlimited number of compression steps simply by ， using many headers. ， The use of such a decompression chain could result in a \"malloc bomb\" , making ， curl end up spending enormous amounts of allocated heap memory , or trying to ， and returning out of memory errors. ， We are not aware of any exploit of this flaw. ， INFO ， CVE-2023-23916 was introduced in [ commit ， dbcced8e32b50c06 ]  ( https : /github.com/curl/curl/commit/dbcced8e32b50c06 )  ,  ， shipped in curl 7.57.0. ， Automatic decompression of content needs to be enabled per transfer. It is ， disabled by default and then nothing bad happens. ， This flaw exists with one or more of the compression algorithms built-in ，  ( gzip , brotli or zstd )  , but the individual algorithms have different ， \"exploding\" powers. ， Both `Content-Encoding : ` and `Transfer-Encoding : ` are affected over all HTTP ， versions. ， This flaw is almost identical to the previous [ CVE-2022-32206 : HTTP ， compression denial of service ]  ( https : /curl.se/docs/CVE-2022-32206.html )  , as ， the fix for that earlier flaw was incomplete. ， CWE-770 : Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling ， Severity : Medium ， AFFECTED VERSIONS ， - Affected versions : curl 7.57.0 to and including 7.87.0 ， - Not affected versions : curl < 7.57.0 and curl >= 7.87.0 ， libcurl is used by many applications , but not always advertised as such !  ， THE SOLUTION ， The amount of accepted \"chained\" algorithms is now capped to 5 in total ,  ， independently of the number of headers. ， A [ fix for CVE-2023-23916 ]  ( https : /github.com/curl/curl/commit/119fb187192a9ea13dc ) ",
