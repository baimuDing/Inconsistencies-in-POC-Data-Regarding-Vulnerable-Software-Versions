If you used such values you ， could suffer from indeterminate SSRF , RFI , and LFI attacks. ， `validate_ipv4_address (  ) ` and `validate_ipv46_address (  ) ` validators were not ， affected on Python 3.9.5+. ， This issue has medium severity , according to the Django security policy. ， Affected supported versions ，  * Django main branch ，  * Django 3.2 ，  * Django 3.1 ，  * Django 2.2",
