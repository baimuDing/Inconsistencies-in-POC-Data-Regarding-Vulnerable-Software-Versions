Management tools must ， access paths in guests' namespaces, necessarily using absolute paths. ， oxenstored imposes a path name limit which is applied solely to the ， relative or absolute path specified by the client. Therefore, a guest ， can create paths in its own namespace which are too long for management ， tools to access. ， IMPACT ， Depending on the toolstack in use, a malicious guest administrator ， might cause some management tools and debugging operations to fail. ， For example, a guest administrator can cause `xenstore-ls -r` to fail. ， However a guest administrator cannot prevent the host administrator ， VULNERABLE SYSTEMS ， All systems using oxenstored are vulnerable. Building and using ， oxenstored is the default in the upstream Xen distribution, if the ， Ocaml compiler is available. ， Systems using C xenstored are not vulnerable."
