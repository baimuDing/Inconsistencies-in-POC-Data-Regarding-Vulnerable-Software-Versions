In 4.2 only 64-bit ， versions of the hypervisor are vulnerable ( HVMOP_set_mem_access is not ， available in 32-bit hypervisors ) . ， The vulnerability is only exposed to service domains for HVM guests ， which have privilege over the guest. In a usual configuration that ， means only device model emulators ( qemu-dm ) . ， In the case of HVM guests whose device model is running in an ， unrestricted dom0 process , qemu-dm already has the ability to cause ， problems for the whole system. So in that case the vulnerability is ， not applicable. ， The situation is more subtle for an HVM guest with a stub qemu-dm. ， That is , where the device model runs in a separate domain ( in the case ， of xl , as requested by \"device_model_stubdomain_override=1\" in the xl ， domain configuration file ) . The same applies with a qemu-dm in a dom0 ， process subjected to some kind kernel-based process privilege ， limitation ( eg the chroot technique as found in some versions of ， XCP/XenServer ) . ， In those latter situations this issue means that the extra isolation ， does not provide as good a defence ( against denial of service ) as ， intended. That is the essence of this vulnerability. ， However , the security is still better than with a qemu-dm running as ， an unrestricted dom0 process. Therefore users with these ， configurations should not switch to an unrestricted dom0 qemu-dm. ， Finally , in a radically disaggregated system : where the HVM service ， domain software ( probably , the device model domain image ) is not ， always supplied by the host administrator , a malicious service domain ， administrator can excercise this vulnerability.",
