For errors potentially being at ， least under the influence of guests, like out of memory conditions, it ， isn't correct to assume so. Memory allocations potentially causing ， such crashes occur only when Linux is running in PV mode, though. ， IMPACT ， A malicious or buggy frontend driver may be able to crash the ， corresponding backend driver, potentially affecting the entire domain ， running the backend driver. ， VULNERABLE SYSTEMS ， Linux versions from at least 2.6.39 onwards are vulnerable, when run in ， PV mode. Earlier versions differ significantly in behavior and may ， therefore instead surface other issues under the same conditions. Linux ， run in HVM / PVH modes is not vulnerable."
