This module ， > is not enabled by default, so administrators must have manually enabled ， > it for their servers to be vulnerable. ， > http:/freeradius.org/security.html#eap-pwd-2015 ， We have revisited this and decided that it needs unique CVE IDs. As ， mentioned on that security.html page, \"These issues were found by ， Jouni Malinen as part of investigating ， http:/w1.fi/security/2015-4/\" - this suggested a possibility that the ， CVE IDs listed in ， http:/www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2015/05/31/6 would be ， applicable. However, FreeRADIUS apparently has an independent ， implementation of EAP-pwd. This led to a somewhat unusual situation in ， which most of the vulnerability findings were, at a high level, the ， same - but resulted from a different set of mistakes within a ， different codebase. The applicable FreeRADIUS changes can be found in ， the \"Commits on May 4, 2015\" section of: ， https:/github.com/FreeRADIUS/freeradius-server/commits/v3.0.x/src/modules/rlm_eap/types/rlm_eap_pwd ， and are distinct from the changes in the http:/w1.fi/security/2015-4/ ， patches. ， We are associating the three CVE IDs below with the items on the ， security.html list, not with the specific FreeRADIUS commits. ， > The EAP-PWD packet length is not checked before the first byte is ， > dereferenced. A zero-length EAP-PWD packet will cause the module to ， > dereference a NULL pointer, and will cause the server to crash. ， Use CVE-2015-8762. ， > The commit message payload length is not validated before the packet ， > is decoded. This can result in a read overflow in the server. ， > The confirm message payload length is not validated before the packet ， > is decoded. This can result in a read overflow in the server. ， Use CVE-2015-8763 for both of these issues. ， > A strcpy() was used to pack a C string into an EAP-PWD packet. This ， > would result in an over-run of the destination buffer by one byte. ， Use CVE-2015-8764. ， CVE assignment team, MITRE CVE Numbering Authority ， M/S M300 ， 202 Burlington Road, Bedford, MA 01730 USA ， [ PGP key available through http:/cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ]"
