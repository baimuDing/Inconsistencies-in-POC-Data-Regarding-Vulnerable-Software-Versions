This ， includes the Qpid Proton C library , and all language binding libraries using ， it. Installations using the native Windows Schannel TLS implementation or ， using OpenSSL 1.1.0 or later are not affected. ， Note that this attack will not work if client certificate authentication is ， in use as anonymous ciphers cannot be used in this case.",
