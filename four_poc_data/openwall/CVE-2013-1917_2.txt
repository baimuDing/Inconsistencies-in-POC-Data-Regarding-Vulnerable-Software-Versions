This instruction , however , leaves the EFLAGS register ， mostly unmodified - in particular , the NT flag doesn't get cleared. If ， the hypervisor subsequently uses IRET to return to the guest ( which it ， will always do if the guest is a 32-bit one )  , that instruction will ， cause a # GP fault to be raised , but the recovery code in the ， hypervisor will again try to use IRET without intermediately clearing ， the NT flag. The # GP fault raised on this second IRET is a fatal ， event , causing the hypervisor to crash. ， IMPACT ， Malicious or buggy unprivileged user space can cause the entire host to crash. ， VULNERABLE SYSTEMS ， All 64-bit Xen versions from 3.1 onwards running on Intel CPUs are ， vulnerable. 32-bit Xen is not affected , as it doesn't permit the use ， of SYSENTER by PV guests. 64-bit Xen run on AMD CPUs isn't affected ， since AMD CPUs don't allow the use of SYSENTER in long mode. ， The vulnerability is only exposed by PV guests.",
