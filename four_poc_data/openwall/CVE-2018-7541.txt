For ， the guest to use the facility, both the \"normal\" shared pages ， (applicable to v1 and v2) and the \"status\" pages (applicable to v2 ， only) need to be mapped by the guest into its address space. ， When transitioning from v2 to v1, the status pages become unnecessary ， and are therefore freed by Xen. That means Xen needs to check that ， there are no mappings of those pages by the domain. However, that ， check was mistakenly implemented as a bug check, rather than returning ， an error to the guest. ， IMPACT ， A malicious or buggy guest may cause a hypervisor crash, resulting in ， a Denial of Service (DoS) affecting the entire host. Privilege ， escalation as well as information leaks cannot be ruled out for HVM, ， PVH (both x86), and ARM guests. ， The impact is more severe for Xen versions 4.0.x, 4.1.0 . 4.1.3, and ， 4.2 in that the pages are freed without any checking, thus allowing ， their re-use for another domain, or by Xen itself, while there still ， are active mappings (see XSA-26). ， VULNERABLE SYSTEMS ， Xen versions 4.0 and newer are vulnerable. ， Both x86 and ARM systems are vulnerable."
