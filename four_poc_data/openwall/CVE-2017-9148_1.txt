    "text": "Subject : CVE-2017-9148 FreeRADIUS TLS resumption authentication bypass ， Vendor : The FreeRADIUS Project ， Product : FreeRADIUS server ， Affected Versions :  ， 2.2.x ( EOL but still found in some Linux distros )  : All versions. ， 3.0.x ( stable )  : All versions before 3.0.14. ， 3.1.x and 4.0.x ( development )  : All versions before 2017-02-04. ， Description :  ， The implementation of TTLS and PEAP in FreeRADIUS skips inner ， authentication when it handles a resumed TLS connection. This is a feature ， but there is a critical catch : the server must never allow resumption of a ， TLS session until its initial connection gets to the point where inner ， authentication has been finished successfully. ， Unfortunately , affected versions of FreeRADIUS fail to reliably prevent ， resumption of unauthenticated sessions unless the TLS session cache is ， disabled completely and allow an attacker ( e.g. a malicious supplicant )  ， to elicit EAP Success without sending any valid credentials.",
