Unfortunately the overflow check when trying to ， obtain a new reference used a mask one bit wider than the reference ， count actually is, rendering the entire check ineffective. ， IMPACT ， A malicious or buggy guest may cause a hypervisor crash, resulting in ， a Denial of Service (DoS) affecting the entire host, or cause hypervisor ， memory corruption. We cannot rule out a guest being able to escalate ， its privilege. ， VULNERABLE SYSTEMS ， Xen versions 4.1 and later are affected. Xen versions 4.0 and earlier ， are not affected. ， x86 systems are vulnerable. ARM systems are not vulnerable. ， Only guests run in shadow mode can exploit the vulnerability. ， PV guests typically only run in shadow mode during live migration, as ， well as for features like VM snapshot. ， Note that save / restore does *not* use shadow mode, and so does not ， expose this vulnerability. Some downstreams also include a \"non-live ， migration\" feature, which also does not use shadow mode (and thus does ， not expose this vulnerability). ， HVM guests run in shadow mode on hardware without HAP support, or when ， HAP is disabled (globally or in the VM configuration file). Live ， migration does not affect an HVM guest's use of shadow mode."
