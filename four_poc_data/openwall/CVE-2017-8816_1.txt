On systems with a 32 bit `size_t` , the math to ， calculate SIZE triggers an integer overflow when the combined lengths of the ， user name and password is larger than 2GB ( 2^31 bytes ) . This integer overflow ， usually causes a very small buffer to actually get allocated instead of the ， intended very huge one , making the use of that buffer end up in a buffer ， overrun. ， We are not aware of any exploit of this flaw. ， INFO ， This bug was introduced in commit ，  [ be285cde3f5 ]  ( https : /github.com/curl/curl/commit/be285cde3f5 )  , April 2006. ， The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures ( CVE ) project has assigned the name ， CVE-2017-8816 to this issue. ， AFFECTED VERSIONS ， This is only an issue on 32 bit systems. It also requires the user and ， password fields to use more than 2GB of memory combined , which in itself ， should be rare. ， - Affected versions : libcurl 7.15.4 to and including 7.56.1 ， - Not affected versions : libcurl < 7.15.4 and >= 7.57.0 ， curl is used by many applications , but not always advertised as such. ， THE SOLUTION ， In libcurl version 7.57.0 , the integer overflow is avoided. ， A [ patch for CVE-2017-8816 ]  ( https : /curl.hax.se/CVE-2017-8816.patch ) is ， available.",
