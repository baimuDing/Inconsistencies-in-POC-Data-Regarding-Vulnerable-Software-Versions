Unfortunately, ， existing granted access rights are not removed when a domain is ， destroyed. This means that a new domain created with the same domid ， will inherit the access rights to Xenstore nodes from the previous ， domain(s) with the same domid. ， All Xenstore entries of a guest below /local/domain/<domid> are ， deleted by Xen tools when a guest is destroyed. Therefore only ， entries belonging to other guests, referring to the deleted guests, ， are potentially affected. ， IMPACT ， In some circumstances, it might be possible for a new guest domain to ， access resources belonging to a previous domain. The impact would ， depend on the software in use and the configuration, but might include ， any of denial of service, information leak, or privilege escalation. ， VULNERABLE SYSTEMS ， All versions of Xen are in principle vulnerable. ， Both Xenstore implementations (C and Ocaml) are vulnerable. ， Vulnerable systems are only those running software where one domain is ， granted access to another's xenstore nodes, without complete cleanup ， of those nodes on domain destruction. No such software is enabled in ， default configurations of upstream Xen. ， Therefore upstream Xen, without additional management software (in ， host or guest(s), is not vulnerable in the default (host and guest) ， configuration."
