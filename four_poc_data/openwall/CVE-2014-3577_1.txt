    "text": "Subject : CVE-2014-3577 : Apache HttpComponents client : Hostname verification susceptible to MITM attack ， -BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE- ， Hash : SHA1 ， Security Advisory - Apache Software Foundation ， Apache HttpComponents / hc.apache.org ， Hostname verification susceptible to MITM attack ， CVE-2014-3577 / CVSS 1.4 ， Apache HttpComponents ( prior to revision 4.3.5/4.0.2 ) may be susceptible ， to a 'Man in the Middle Attack' due to a flaw in the default hostname ， verification during SSL/TLS when a specially crafted server side ， certificate is used. ， Background ， During an SSL connection ( https ) the client verifies the hostname in ， the URL against the hostname as encoded in the servers certificate ( CN ,  ， subjectAlt fields ) . This is to ensure that the client connects to the ， 'real' server , as opposed to something in middle ( man in the middle )  ， that may compromise end to end confidentiality and integrity. ， Details ， The flaw is in the default Apache HttpComponents ， org.apache.http.conn.ssl.AbstractVerifier ， that is used in client mode for verification of hostname of the server ， side certificate. It parsed the entire subject distinguished name ( DN )  ， Therefore a DN of with a O field such as ， O=\"foo , CN=www.apache.org ， and a CN of \"www.evil.org and ordered such that the O appears prior to ， the CN field would incorrectly match match on the <www.apache.org> in ， the O field as opposed to just the values in the CN and alternative ， subject name ( s ) . ， The doctored field can be any field but the CN field itself ; including ， the <E> or emailAddress field as long as it appears before the CN ( some ， CAs reorder the DN ) . ， A third party in posession of such a doctored certificate and who also ， has the ability to intercept or reroute the traffic to a https server ， under its control ( e.g. through DNS doctoring or various forms of ， traffic rerouting or spoofing ) can thus perform a 'man in the middle' ， attack and compromise end to end confidentiality and integrety. ， Note that while some certificate authorities may be relatively strict ， on what they allow in the various fields - most are NOT ; and allow ， and E fields. ， Impact :  ， A man-in-the-middle can interpose itself between the server and the ， code using an affected version of Apache HttpComponents as a client. ， Leading to complete loss of end to end confidentiality and end to ， end integrety of the connection. ， Versions affected :  ， All versions prior to HttpClient 4.3.5 ( including the Android port )  ， and HttpAsyncClient 4.0.2. The fix was introduced in these versions. ， http : /search.maven.org/ # artifactdetails | org.apache.httpcomponents |  ， httpclient | 4.3.5 | jar ， http : /search.maven.org/ # artifactdetails | org.apache.httpcomponents |  ， httpasyncclient | 4.0.2 | jar ， These have been silently pushed out to Maven central and Apache Dist ， as of 2014-08-1. An Android build was released on 2014-08-15.",
