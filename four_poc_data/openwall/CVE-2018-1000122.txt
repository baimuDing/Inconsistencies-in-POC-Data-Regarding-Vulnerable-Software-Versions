The memcpy call would copy data from the heap ， following the buffer to a storage area that would subsequently be delivered to ， the application ( if it didn't cause a crash ) . We've managed to get it to reach ， several hundreds bytes out of range. ， This could lead to information leakage or a denial of service for the ， application if the server offering the RTSP data can trigger this. ， We are not aware of any exploit of this flaw. ， INFO ， This bug was introduced in January 2010 in [ this ， commit ]  ( https : /github.com/curl/curl/commit/bc4582b68a673d3 ) when RTSP support ， was first added. ， The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures ( CVE ) project has assigned the name ， CVE-2018-1000122 to this issue. ， CWE-126 : Buffer Over-read ， AFFECTED VERSIONS ， - Affected versions : curl 7.20.0 to and including curl 7.58.0 ， - Not affected versions : curl < 7.20.0 and curl >= 7.59.0 ， libcurl is used by many applications , but not always advertised as such. ， THE SOLUTION ， In curl version 7.59.0 , curl makes sure that this code never gets told to copy ， more data than it is allowed to read from the buffer. ， A [ patch for CVE-2018-1000122 ]  ( https : /curl.hax.se/CVE-2018-1000122.patch ) is available.",
