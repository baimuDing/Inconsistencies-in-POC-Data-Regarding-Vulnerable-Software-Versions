However, the ， code doing so fails to set the newly allocated page's accounting ， properties correctly, resulting in the page becoming not only unusable ， by the target domain, but also unfreeable upon domain cleanup. The page ， as well as certain other remnants of an affected guest will be leaked. ， Furthermore internal state of the processing code was also not updated ， correctly, resulting in the insertion of an IOMMU mapping to the page ， being replaced (and subsequently freed), allowing the domain access to ， memory it does not own. ， IMPACT ， The primary impact is a memory leak. Malicious or buggy guests with ， passed through PCI devices may also be able to escalate their ， privileges, crash the host, or access data belonging to other guests. ， VULNERABLE SYSTEMS ， All Xen versions from at least 3.2 onwards are vulnerable. ， 64-bit x86 PV guests can leverage the vulnerability on hosts with ， physical memory extending past the 16 TiB boundary. This is only ， possible for hypervisors built with CONFIG_BIGMEM enabled. ， 32-bit x86 PV guests can leverage the vulnerability on hosts with ， physical memory extending past the 168 GiB boundary. ， x86 HVM and PVH guests cannot leverage the vulnerability on libxl ， based systems. On xend based systems x86 HVM guests can leverage ， the vulnerability if their guest config file has a ， 'machine_address_size' setting. ， ARM systems are not vulnerable."
