This may have security implications if you for ， example use a URL parser that follows the RFC to check for allowed domains ， before using curl to request them. ， Passing in `http : /example.com #  @ .l.com/x.txt` would wrongly make curl send a ， request to evil.com while your browser would connect to example.com given the ， same URL. ， The problem exists for most protocol schemes. ， We are not aware of any exploit of this flaw. ， INFO ， The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures ( CVE ) project has assigned the name ， CVE-2016-8624 to this issue. ， AFFECTED VERSIONS ， This flaw exists in the following curl versions. ， - Affected versions : curl 7.1 to and including 7.50.3 ， - Not affected versions : curl >= 7.51.0 ， libcurl is used by many applications , but not always advertised as such !  ， THE SOLUTION ， In version 7.51.0 , the parser function is fixed. ， A [ patch for CVE-2016-8624 ]  ( https : /curl.hax.se/CVE-2016-8624.patch ) is ， available.",
