This allows a site to set cookies that then would get sent to ， different and unrelated sites and domains. ， It could do this by exploiting a mixed case flaw in curl's function that ， verifies a given cookie domain against the Public Suffix List ( PSL ) . For ， example a cookie could be set with `domain=co.UK` when the URL used a ， lowercase hostname `curl.co.uk` , even though `co.uk` is listed as a PSL ， domain. ， INFO ， When curl is built without PSL support , it cannot protect against this problem ， but it is expected to not allow \"too wide\" cookies when PSL support is ， enabled. ， The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures ( CVE ) project has assigned the name ， CVE-2023-46218 to this issue. ， CWE-201 : Information Exposure Through Sent Data ， Severity : Medium ， AFFECTED VERSIONS ， - Affected versions : curl 7.46.0 to and including 8.4.0 ， - Not affected versions : curl < 7.46.0 and >= 8.5.0 ， - Introduced-in : https : /github.com/curl/curl/commit/e77b5b7453c1e8c ， libcurl is used by many applications , but not always advertised as such !  ， This flaw is also accessible using the curl command line tool. ， SOLUTION ， Starting in curl 8.5.0 , the code lowercases both strings before checks. ， - Fixed-in : https : /github.com/curl/curl/commit/2b0994c29a721c91c57",
