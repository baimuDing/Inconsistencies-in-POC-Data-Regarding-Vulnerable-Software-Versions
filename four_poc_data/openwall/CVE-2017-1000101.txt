The URL is stored in a heap ， based buffer , so it could then be made to wrongly read something else instead ， of crashing. ， An example of a URL that triggers the flaw would be ， `http : /ur%20 [ 0-60000000000000000000`. ， We are not aware of any exploit of this flaw. ， INFO ， This flaw only affects the curl command line tool , not the libcurl ， library. The bug was introduced in commit ，  [ 5ca96cb84410270 ]  ( https : /github.com/curl/curl/commit/5ca96cb84410270 )  , August ， 2013. curl 7.34.0. ， For version 7.55.0 , the parser properly stops at the end of the string and a ， test has been added to verify this. ， The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures ( CVE ) project has assigned the name ， CVE-2017-1000101 to this issue. ， AFFECTED VERSIONS ， - Affected versions : curl 7.34.0 to and including 7.54.1 ， - Not affected versions : curl < 7.34.0 and >= 7.55.1 ， curl is used by many applications , but not always advertised as such. ， THE SOLUTION ， A [ patch for CVE-2017-1000101 ]  ( https : /curl.hax.se/CVE-2017-1000101.patch ) is ， available.",
