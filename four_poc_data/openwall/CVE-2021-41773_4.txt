It also seems to ， match the one by your colleage Stefan ( that you referenced ) . ， I just wanted to clarify that the impact of both CVEs is exactly the ， same : RCE and/or arbitrary file read and/or none , depending on httpd ， config : - ) . There's no difference between Apache 2.4.49 and 2.4.50 in ， that regard. ， But reading the blog post by Stefan ，  ( https : /github.com/icing/blog/blob/main/httpd-2.4.50.md ) and Apache ， HTTP 2.4 vulns security page ，  ( https : /httpd.apache.org/security/vulnerabilities_24.html ) as well , I ， feel like you are associating the RCE impact to 2.4.50 and the arbitrary ， file read to 2.4.49. That's misleading.",
