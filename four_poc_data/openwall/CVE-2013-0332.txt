POsting stuff to a ， forum is not exactly the easiest place to find things, can they setup ， like zoneminder.com/security/ and at least list all the security ， issues and link to them there so people don't have to dig through the ， forums? ， I say this because this is the first cve request I've ever seen for ， zoneminder since I started assigning, and indeed, since 2008, so I'm ， guessing there's a few more missing ones. ， If someone wants to big through the forums to find them and post them ， here that would probably be helpful (seriously, wanna pad your resume ， and get a reference from me? first person to make 100 good CVE ， requests wins). ， > where zoneminder is prone to a local file inclusion vulnerability. ， > From upstream versions prior to 1.24.4 are affected and the issue ， > was fixed in 1.24.4 and 1.25.0. ， > SVN commits fixing this issue for the 1.24.x versions are r3483 ， > and r3488, and patches: ， > http:/www.zoneminder.com/downloads/lfi-patch.txt ， > http:/www.zoneminder.com/downloads/lfi-patch2.txt ， > I haven't found a CVE assigned to this already.
