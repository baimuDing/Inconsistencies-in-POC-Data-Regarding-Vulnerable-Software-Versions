The updated patch includes a fix for this. ， ISSUE DESCRIPTION ， 1) Code to handle copy operations on transitive grants has built in ， retry logic, involving a function reinvoking itself with unchanged ， parameters. Such use assumes that the compiler would also translate ， this to a so called \"tail call\" when generating machine code. ， Empirically, this is not commonly the case, allowing for ， theoretically unbounded nesting of such function calls. ， 2) The reference counting and locking discipline for transitive grants ， is broken. Concurrent use of the transitive grant can leak ， references on the transitively-referenced grant. ， IMPACT ， A malicious or buggy guest may be able to crash Xen. Privilege ， escalation and information leaks cannot be ruled out. A malicious or ， buggy guest can leak references on grants it has been given, amounting ， to a DoS against the grantee. ， VULNERABLE SYSTEMS ， All versions of Xen are vulnerable."
