    "text": "Subject : CVE-2022-42920 : Apache Commons BCEL prior to 6.6.0 allows ， producing arbitrary bytecode via out-of-bounds writing ， Description :  ， Apache Commons BCEL has a number of APIs that would normally only allow changing specific class characteristics. However , due to an out-of-bounds writing issue , these APIs can be used to produce arbitrary bytecode. This could be abused in applications that pass attacker-controllable data to those APIs , giving the attacker more control over the resulting bytecode than otherwise expected. Update to Apache Commons BCEL 6.6.0. ， This issue is being tracked as BCEL-363",
