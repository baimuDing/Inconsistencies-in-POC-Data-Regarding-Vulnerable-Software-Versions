They have requested I ， not reveal the details , so I am treating that and the patch details as ， embargoed for the time being. ， Without revealing too much ( I hope ) I can confirm :  ，  * It is a known vulnerability ， - to upstream that is , but no CVE assigned. ，  * The initial report of this issue to upstream occured during 2009. ，  * Squid 1.x , 2.x , and 3.0 releases are all vulnerable. ，  * All Squid-3.1 stable releases are not vunerable. ， - eg , you can bump the fixed version number back to 3.1.1 for most OS ， distributions. ， For the record ; there is now FALSE information floating around in some ， CVE-2015-0881 \"copies\" about it being about CRLF issues. The Cisco ， report came to my attention first , but they are not alone. ， To all those people cut-n-pasting blurb text from CWE-113 in place of ， the JPCERT description : please dont do that. There are multiple \"HTTP ， response splitting\" attack vectors which have nothing to do with the ，  ( current ) CWE-113 description. This is one of those cases. ， HTH ， Amos Jeffries ， Squid Software Foundation",
