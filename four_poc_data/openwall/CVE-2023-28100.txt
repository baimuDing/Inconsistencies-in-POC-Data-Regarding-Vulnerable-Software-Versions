    "text": "Subject : flatpak : CVE-2023-28100 : TIOCLINUX can send commands outside sandbox ， https : /github.com/flatpak/flatpak/security/advisories/GHSA-7qpw-3vjv-xrqp ， Vulnerable : all < 1.10.8 , 1.12.x < 1.12.8 , 1.14.x < 1.14.4 , 1.15.x < 1.15.4 ， Fixed : 1.15.4 , 1.14.x >= 1.14.4 , 1.12.x >= 1.12.8 , 1.10.x >= 1.10.8 ， Flatpak is a system for building , distributing , and running sandboxed ， desktop applications on Linux. ， Jakub Wilk mentioned on the oss-security mailing list that various ， projects' mitigations for the problematic design of the TIOCSTI ioctl ， are not sufficient in all cases , because Linux virtual terminals ， implement copy/paste via the TIOCLINUX ioctl , which can have a similar ， effect. Flatpak is one of the projects affected by this. ， If a malicious Flatpak app is run on a Linux virtual console such as ， /dev/tty1 , it can copy text from the virtual console and paste it back ， into the virtual console's input buffer , from which the command might ， be run by the user's shell after the Flatpak app has exited. This is ， similar to CVE-2017-5226 , but using the TIOCLINUX ioctl command instead ， of TIOCSTI. ， This has been fixed in Flatpak upstream releases 1.14.4 , 1.15.4 , 1.12.8 ， and 1.10.8 by preventing the TIOCLINUX ioctl via a seccomp filter ,  ， in the same way that was already done for the TIOCSTI ioctl.",
