    "text": "Subject : OpenSSL X.509 Email Address 4-byte Buffer Overflow ( CVE-2022-3602 )  , X.509 Email Address Variable Length Buffer Overflow ( CVE-2022-3786 )  ， I don't know whether the OpenSSL project would be posting this to ， oss-security themselves ( they really should have )  , but with publications ， elsewhere out for an hour or so I felt it's best if I forward in here. ， There's also a blog post with a FAQ :  ， https : /www.openssl.org/blog/blog/2022/11/01/email-address-overflows/ ， - Forwarded message from OpenSSL <openssl @ .nssl.org> - ， OpenSSL User Support ML <openssl-users @ .nssl.org> ,  ， OpenSSL Announce ML <openssl-announce @ .nssl.org> ， Subject : OpenSSL Security Advisory ， -BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE- ， Hash : SHA256 ， OpenSSL Security Advisory [ 01 November 2022 ]  ， X.509 Email Address 4-byte Buffer Overflow ( CVE-2022-3602 )  ， Severity : High ， A buffer overrun can be triggered in X.509 certificate verification ,  ， specifically in name constraint checking. Note that this occurs ， after certificate chain signature verification and requires either a ， CA to have signed the malicious certificate or for the application to ， to a trusted issuer. An attacker can craft a malicious email address ， to overflow four attacker-controlled bytes on the stack. This buffer ， overflow could result in a crash ( causing a denial of service ) or ， potentially remote code execution. ， Many platforms implement stack overflow protections which would mitigate ， against the risk of remote code execution. The risk may be further ， mitigated based on stack layout for any given platform/compiler. ， Pre-announcements of CVE-2022-3602 described this issue as CRITICAL. ， Further analysis based on some of the mitigating factors described above ， have led this to be downgraded to HIGH. Users are still encouraged to ， upgrade to a new version as soon as possible. ， In a TLS client , this can be triggered by connecting to a malicious ， server. In a TLS server , this can be triggered if the server requests ， client authentication and a malicious client connects. ， OpenSSL versions 3.0.0 to 3.0.6 are vulnerable to this issue. ， OpenSSL 3.0 users should upgrade to OpenSSL 3.0.7. ， OpenSSL 1.1.1 and 1.0.2 are not affected by this issue. ， This issue was reported to OpenSSL on 17th October 2022 by Polar Bear. ， The fixes were developed by Dr Paul Dale. ， We are not aware of any working exploit that could lead to code execution ,  ， and we have no evidence of this issue being exploited as of the time of ， release of this advisory ( November 1st 2022 ) . ， X.509 Email Address Variable Length Buffer Overflow ( CVE-2022-3786 )  ， Severity : High ， A buffer overrun can be triggered in X.509 certificate verification ,  ， specifically in name constraint checking. Note that this occurs after ， certificate chain signature verification and requires either a CA to ， have signed a malicious certificate or for an application to continue ， certificate verification despite failure to construct a path to a trusted ， issuer. An attacker can craft a malicious email address in a certificate ， to overflow an arbitrary number of bytes containing the `.' character ，  ( decimal 46 ) on the stack. This buffer overflow could result in a crash ，  ( causing a denial of service ) . ， In a TLS client , this can be triggered by connecting to a malicious ， server. In a TLS server , this can be triggered if the server requests ， client authentication and a malicious client connects. ， OpenSSL versions 3.0.0 to 3.0.6 are vulnerable to this issue. ， OpenSSL 3.0 users should upgrade to OpenSSL 3.0.7. ， OpenSSL 1.1.1 and 1.0.2 are not affected by this issue. ， This issue was discovered on 18th October 2022 by Viktor Dukhovni while ， researching CVE-2022-3602. The fixes were developed by Dr Paul Dale. ， We have no evidence of this issue being exploited as of the time of ， release of this advisory ( November 1st 2022 ) . ， References ， URL for this Security",
