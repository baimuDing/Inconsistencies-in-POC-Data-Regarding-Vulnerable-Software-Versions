This vulnerability has been assigned the CVE identifier CVE-2015-7577. ， Versions Affected : 3.1.0 and newer ， Not affected : 3.0.x and older ， Fixed Versions : 5.0.0.beta1.1 , 4.2.5.1 , 4.1.14.1 , 3.2.22.1 ， Impact ， When using the nested attributes feature in Active Record you can prevent the ， destruction of associated records by passing the `allow_destroy : false` option ， to the `accepts_nested_attributes_for` method. However due to a change in the ， commit [ a9b4b5d ]  [ 1 ] the `_destroy` flag prevents the ` : reject_if` proc from ， being called because it assumes that the record will be destroyed anyway. ， However this isn't true if ` : allow_destroy` is false so this leads to changes ， that would have been rejected being applied to the record. Attackers could use ， this do things like set attributes to invalid values and to clear all of the ， attributes amongst other things. The severity will be dependent on how the ， application has used this feature. ， All users running an affected release should either upgrade or use one of ， the workarounds immediately. ， Releases ， The FIXED releases are available at the normal locations.",
