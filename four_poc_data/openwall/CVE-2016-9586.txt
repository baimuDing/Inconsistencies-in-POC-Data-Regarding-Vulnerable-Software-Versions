The bug occurs when the conversion ， outputs more than 255 bytes. ， The flaw happens because the floating point conversion is using system ， functions without the correct boundary checks. ， The functions have been documented as deprecated for a long time and users are ， discouraged from using them in \"new programs\" as they are planned to get ， removed at a future point. But as the functions are present and there's ， nothing preventing users from using them , we expect there to be a certain ， amount of existing users in the wild. ， If there are any application that accepts a format string from the outside ， without necessary input filtering , it could allow remote attacks. ， This flaw does not exist in the command line tool. ， We are not aware of any exploit of this flaw. ， INFO ， The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures ( CVE ) project has assigned the name ， CVE-2016-9586 to this issue. ， AFFECTED VERSIONS ， This flaw exists in the following libcurl versions. ， - Affected versions : libcurl 7.1 to and including 7.51.0 ， - Not affected versions : libcurl >= 7.52.0 ， libcurl is used by many applications , but not always advertised as such !  ， THE SOLUTION ， In version 7.52.0 , the conversion is limited to never generate a larger output ， than what fits in the fixed size buffer. ， A [ patch for CVE-2016-9586 ]  ( https : /curl.hax.se/CVE-2016-9586.patch ) is ， available.",
