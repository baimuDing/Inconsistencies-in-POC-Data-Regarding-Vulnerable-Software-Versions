In the latter case this would affect the entire host. ， VULNERABLE SYSTEMS ， Xen versions 4.12.3, 4.12.4, and all versions from 4.13.1 onwards are ， vulnerable. Xen version 4.13.0 and all versions up to 4.12.2 are not ， affected. ， Only x86 systems running HVM guests with PCI pass through devices are ， vulnerable."
