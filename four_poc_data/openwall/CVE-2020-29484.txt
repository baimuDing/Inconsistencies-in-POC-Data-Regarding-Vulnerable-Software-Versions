The payload length is ， limited to 4096 bytes. Any request to xenstored resulting in a ， response with a payload longer than 4096 bytes will result in an ， error. ， When registering a watch the payload length limit applies to the ， combined length of the watched path and the specified tag. As watches ， the payload of a watch event message can be longer than the payload ， needed to register the watch. ， A malicious guest which registers a watch using a very large tag (ie ， with a registration operation payload length close to the 4096 byte ， limit) can cause the generation of watch events with a payload length ， larger than 4096 bytes, by writing to Xenstore entries below the ， watched path. ， This will result in an error condition in xenstored. This error can ， result in a NULL pointer dereference leading to a crash of xenstored. ， IMPACT ， A malicious guest administrator can cause xenstored to crash, leading ， to a denial of service. Following a xenstored crash, domains may ， VULNERABLE SYSTEMS ， All Xen versions are affected. ， Only C xenstored is affected, oxenstored is not affected."
