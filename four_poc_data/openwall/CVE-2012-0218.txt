Previous versions were embargoed. ， ISSUE DESCRIPTION ， When guest user code running inside a Xen guest operating system ， attempts to execute a syscall or sysenter instruction, but when the ， guest operating system has not registered a handler for that ， instruction, a General Protection Fault may need to be injected into ， the guest. ， It has been discovered that the code in Xen which does this fails to ， clear a flag requesting exception injection, with the result that a ， future exception taken by the guest and handled entirely inside Xen ， will also be injected into the guest despite Xen having handled it ， already, probably crashing the guest. ， IMPACT ， User space processes on some guest operating systems may be able to ， crash the guest. ， VULNERABLE SYSTEMS ， HVM guests are not vulnerable. ， 32- and 64-bit PV guests may be vulnerable, depending on the CPU ， hardware, the guest operating system, and its exact kernel version and ， configuration."
