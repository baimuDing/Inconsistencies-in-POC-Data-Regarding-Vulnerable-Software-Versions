    "text": "Subject : CVE-2021-4122 : cryptsetup 2.x : decryption through LUKS2 reencryption ， crash recovery ， Description :  ， LUKS2 is an on-disk format for disk-encryption configuration with ， cryptsetup as the tool for configuration on Linux systems. ， LUKS2 online reencryption is an optional extension to allow a user to ， change the data reencryption key while the data device is available for ， use during the whole reencryption process. ， CVE-2021-4122 describes a possible attack against data confidentiality ， through LUKS2 online reencryption extension crash recovery. ， An attacker can modify on-disk metadata to simulate decryption in ， progress with crashed ( unfinished ) reencryption step and persistently ， decrypt part of the LUKS device. ， This attack requires repeated physical access to the LUKS device but ， no knowledge of user passphrases. ， The decryption step is performed after a valid user activates ， the device with a correct passphrase and modified metadata. ， There are no visible warnings for the user that such recovery happened ，  ( except using the luksDump command ) . The attack can also be reversed ， afterward ( simulating crashed encryption from a plaintext ) with ， possible modification of revealed plaintext. ， The size of possible decrypted data depends on configured LUKS2 header ， size ( metadata size is configurable for LUKS2 ) . ， With the default parameters ( 16 MiB LUKS2 header ) and only one ， allocated keyslot ( 512 bit key for AES-XTS )  , simulated decryption with ， checksum resilience SHA1 ( 20 bytes checksum for 4096-byte blocks )  ,  ， the maximal decrypted size can be over 3GiB. ， The attack is not applicable to LUKS1 format , but the attacker can ， update metadata in place to LUKS2 format as an additional step. ， For such a converted LUKS2 header , the keyslot area is limited to ， decrypted size ( with SHA1 checksums ) over 300 MiB. ， The problem was caused by reusing a mechanism designed for actual ， reencryption operation without reassessing the security impact for new ， encryption and decryption operations. While the reencryption requires ， calculating and verifying both key digests , no digest was needed to ， initiate decryption recovery if the destination is plaintext ( no ， encryption key ) . Also , some metadata ( like encryption cipher ) is not ， protected , and an attacker could change it. Note that LUKS2 protects ， visible metadata only when a random change occurs. It does not protect ， against intentional modification but such modification must not cause ， a violation of data confidentiality. ， Affected versions :  ， The issue is present in all cryptsetup releases since 2.2.0. ， Versions 1.x , 2.0.x , and 2.1.x are not affected , as these do not ， contain LUKS2 reencryption extension.",
