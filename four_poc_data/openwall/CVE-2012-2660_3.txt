    "text": "Subject : Unsafe Query Generation Risk in Ruby on Rails ( CVE-2013-0155 )  ， Unsafe Query Generation Risk in Ruby on Rails ， There is a vulnerability when Active Record is used in conjunction with JSON parameter parsing. This vulnerability has been assigned the CVE identifier CVE-2013-0155. ， Versions Affected : 3.x series ， Not affected : 2.x series ， Fixed Versions : 3.2.11 , 3.1.10 , 3.0.19 ， Impact ， Due to the way Active Record interprets parameters in combination with the way that JSON parameters are parsed , it is possible for an attacker to issue unexpected database queries with \"IS NULL\" or empty where clauses. This issue does * not * let an attacker insert arbitrary values into an SQL query , however they can cause the query to check for NULL or eliminate a WHERE clause when most users wouldn't expect it. ， For example , a system has password reset with token functionality :  ， unless params [  : token ] .nil? ， user = User.find_by_token ( params [  : token ]  )  ， user.reset_password !  ， end ， An attacker can craft a request such that `params [  : token ] ` will return ` [ nil ] `. The ` [ nil ] ` value will bypass the test for nil , but will still add an \"IN ( 'xyz' , NULL ) \" clause to the SQL query. ， Similarly , an attacker can craft a request such that `params [  : token ] ` will return an empty hash. An empty hash will eliminate the WHERE clause of the query , but can bypass the `nil?` check. ， Note that this impacts not only dynamic finders ( `find_by_ * ` ) but also relations ( `User.where (  : name => params [  : name ]  ) ` ) . ， All users running an affected release should either upgrade or use one of the work arounds immediately. All users running an affected release should upgrade immediately. Please note , this vulnerability is a variant of CVE-2012-2660 , and CVE-2012-2694. Even if you upgraded to address those issues , you must take action again. ， If this chance in behavior impacts your application , you can manually decode the original values from the request like so :  ， ActiveSupport : JSON.decode ( request.body )  ， Releases ， The FIXED releases are available at the normal locations.",
