Due to too lax a check in one of the hypervisor ， routines used for shadow page handling it is possible for a guest with a PCI ， device passed through to cause the hypervisor to access an arbitrary pointer ， partially under guest control. ， IMPACT ， Guests running in shadow mode and having a PCI device passed through may be ， able to cause Denial of Service and other problems, escalation of privilege ， cannot be ruled out. ， VULNERABLE SYSTEMS ， Only Xen version 4.17 is vulnerable. ， Only x86 systems are vulnerable. The vulnerability can be leveraged only ， by HVM guests running with shadow paging and having a PCI device passed ， through."
