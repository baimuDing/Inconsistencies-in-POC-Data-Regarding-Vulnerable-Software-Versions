Sytems using AMD CPUs, ， and Arm systems, are not vulnerable. ， Only systems using nested paging (\"hap\", aka nested paging, aka in ， this case Intel EPT) are vulnerable. ， Only HVM and PVH guests can exploit the vulnerability. ， The presence and scope of the vulnerability depends on the precise ， optimisations performed by the compiler used to build Xen. If the ， compiler generates (a) a single 64-bit write, or (b) a series of ， read-modify-write operations which are in the same order as the source ， code, the hypervisor is not vulnerable. ， For example, in one test build with gcc 8.3 with normal settings, the ， compiler generated multiple (unlocked) read-modify-write operations in ， source code order, which did *not* constitute a vulnerability. ， We have not been able to survey compilers; consequently we cannot say ， which compiler(s) might produce vulnerable code (with which code ， generation options). The code clearly violates the C rules. So we ， have chosen to issue this advisory."
