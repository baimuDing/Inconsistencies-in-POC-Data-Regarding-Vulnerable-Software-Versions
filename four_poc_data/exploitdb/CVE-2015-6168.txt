I did not investigate this vulnerability thoroughly, so I cannot speculate on the potential impact or exploitability.\r ， Known affected software and attack vectors\r ， Microsoft Edge 11.0.10240.16384\r ， An attacker would need to get a target user to open a specially crafted web-page. Disabling JavaScript does not prevent an attacker from triggering the vulnerable code path.\r ， Repro:\r ， /<style>:first-letter{word-spacing:9\r ， Variation:\r ， x<style>:first-letter{background-position:inherit\r ， Description\r ， At the time this issue was first discovered, MemGC was just introduced, and I had not yet fully appreciated what an impact it would have on mitigating use-after-free bugs. Despite MemGC being enabled in Microsoft Edge by default, this issue appeared to me to have been a use-after-free vulnerability. However, both Microsoft and ZDI (whom I sold the vulnerability to) describes it as a memory corruption vulnerability, so it's probably more complex than I assumed.\r ， At the time, I did not consider this vulnerability to be of great interest, as there was no immediately obvious way of controlling the vulnerability in order to exploit it. So, I did not do any further investigation into the root cause and, if this was indeed a use-after-free, how come MemGC did not mitigate it? In hindsight, it would have been a good idea to investigate the root cause, as any use-after-free that is not mitigated by MemGC might provide hints on how to find more vulnerabilities that bypass it.\r ， Time-line\r ， August 2015: This vulnerability was found through fuzzing.\r ， August 2015: This vulnerability was submitted to ZDI.\r ， December 2015: Microsoft addresses this vulnerability in MS15-125.\r ， December 2016: Details of this vulnerability are released."
