First launched in 2001 , SharePoint has historically been ， associated with intranet content management and document management , but recent versions have significantly broader capabilities. ， Microsoft has two versions of SharePoint available at no cost , but it sells premium editions with additional functionality , and ， provides a cloud service edition as part of their Office 365 platform ( previously BPOS ) . The product is also sold through a cloud ， model by many third-party vendors. ， SharePoint comprises a multipurpose set of Web technologies backed by a common technical infrastructure. By default , SharePoint has a ， Microsoft Office-like interface , and it is closely integrated with the Office suite. The web tools are designed to be usable by non- ， technical users. SharePoint can be used to provide intranet portals , document & file management , collaboration , social networks , extranets ,  ， websites , enterprise search , and business intelligence. It also has system integration , process integration , and workflow automation capabilities. ， Enterprise application software ( e.g. ERP or CRM packages ) often provide some SharePoint integration capability , and SharePoint also ， incorporates a complete development stack based on web technologies and standards-based APIs. As an application platform , SharePoint provides ， central management , governance , and security controls for implementation of these requirements. The SharePoint platform integrates directly ， into IIS - enabling bulk management , scaling , and provisioning of servers , as is often required by large organizations or cloud hosting providers. ， In 2008 , the Gartner Group put SharePoint in the`leaders` quadrant in three of its Magic Quadrants ( for search , portals , and enterprise content ， management ) . SharePoint is used by 78% of Fortune 500 companies [ citation needed ] . Between 2006 to 2011 , Microsoft sold over 36.5 million user ， licenses [ citation needed ] . ，  ( Copy of the Homepage :  )  ， Abstract :  ， The Vulnerability Laboratory Research Team discovered a persistent web vulnerability in the official Microsoft Sharepoint Online ( cloud-based ) application. ， Report-Timeline :  ， 2013-02-01 : Researcher Notification & Coordination ( Benjamin Kunz Mejri )  ， 2013-02-06 : Vendor Notification ( Microsoft Security Response Center - MSRC )  ， 2013-02-07 : Vendor Response/Feedback ( Microsoft Security Response Center - MSRC )  ， 2013-09-11 : Vendor Fix/Patch ( Microsoft Security Bulletin )  ， 2013-09-11 : Public Disclosure ( Vulnerability Laboratory )  ， Status :  ， Published ， Affected Products :  ， Microsoft Corp. ， Product : Sharepoint Online ( Cloud-Based )  ， Exploitation-Technique :  ， Remote ， Severity :  ， High ， Details :  ， A persistent input validation vulnerability is detected in the official Microsoft Sharepoint 2013 Online ( cloud-based ) web-application. ， The vulnerability allows remote attackers to inject own malicious script code to a vulnerable module on application-side ( persistent ) . ， The vulnerability is located in the `Sharepoint Online Cloud 2013 Service` section when processing to request the `Berechtigungen fr ， den Metadatenspeicher festlegen` module with manipulated ms-descriptionText > ctl00_PlaceHolderDialogBodySection_ ， PlaceHolderDialogBodyMainSection_ValSummary parameters. The persistent injected script code execution occurs in the main ， `invalid BDC bereinstimmung` web application exception-handling. ， The vulnerability can be exploited with a low ( restricted ) privileged application user account and low or medium required user interaction. ， Successful exploitation of the vulnerability result in persistent session hijacking , persistent phishing , stable external redirect , stable ， external malware loads and persistent vulnerable module context manipulation. ， Vulnerable Service ( s )  :  ，  [ + ] Microsoft - Sharepoint Online ( cloud-based )  ， Vulnerable Module ( s )  :  ，  [ + ] Berechtigungen fr den Metadatenspeicher festlegen - BDC Metadatenspeicher zuweisen ， Vulnerable Parameter ( s )  :  ，  [ + ] ms-descriptionText > ctl00_PlaceHolderDialogBodySection_PlaceHolderDialogBodyMainSection_ValSummary ，  [ + ] TA_ManageBDCPermissions_data ， Affected Module ( s )  :  ，  [ + ] BDC bereinstimmung > Exception Handling",
