    "text": "ecve : CVE-2000-1144 ， title : ManTrap 1.6.1 - Root Directory Inode Disclosure - Unix local Exploit ， verified : Verified ， exploit_detail : / *  ， source :  ， ManTrap is a \"honeypot\" intrusion detection system designed to lure attackers into it for analysis. The honeypot is implemented as a chroot'ed Solaris environment , designed to look and feel real to an attacker who gains access to it. ， Chroot ( change root ) is a unix mechanism that allows an administrator to force a process/process group to run under a subset of the file system , denying access to any other parts of the file system. It is possible for an attacker to guess that they are on a chrooted (  ) ManTrap system by looking at the inode of the root directory ( ls -id / ) . If it is high ( usually within the 100000-200000 range )  , then the root directory is a chrooted (  ) subset of a larger filesystem. ， This vulnerability , combined with hidden process disclosure ( bugtraq ID 1908 ) should fairly accurately verify to an attaacker ( without root privs ) that the host is a ManTrap honeypot , defeating its purpose. ，  * / ， / *  ，  * ManTrap detection/testing program by wilson / f8labs - www.f8labs.org ，  * /",
