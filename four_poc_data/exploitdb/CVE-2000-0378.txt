It is designed to allow only console users to utilize things such as sound devices. It will chown devices to users upon logging in , and chown them back to being owned by root upon logout. However , as certain devices do not have a 'hangup' mechanism , like a tty device , it is possible for a local user to continue to monitor activity on certain devices after logging out. This could allow an malicious user to sniff other users console sessions , and potentially obtain the root password if the root user logs in , or a user su's to root. They could also surreptitiously execute commands as the user on the console. ，  * /",
