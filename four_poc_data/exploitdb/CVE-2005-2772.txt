Gopher is an Internet technology ，  * that predates the Web. It presents information as a virtual ，  * network-wide filesystem. Modern browsers such as Konqueror ，  * can display gopherspace as if it contained files on your ，  * local machine ( trees , drag and drop , etc. )  , but the ，  * difference is that each file or folder in that tree may be ，  * on a different machine. ，  * this client contains a remotely exploitable buffer overflow ，  * in the processing of \"+VIEWS : \" information , located in ，  * SRC/object/VIews.c in the VIfromLine (  ) function. ，  * this is a stack overflow that can be exploited immediately ，  * upon the client's connection to an untrusted gopher server. ，  * while this is a stack overflow , exploitation of this ，  * overflow is not completely standard , and special values ，  * will be needed for it to work. ( see the first three DEFINEs ，  * below )  ，  * i made this simply to be sure it was possible to exploit ,  ，  * tested successfully on mandrake/9.2 with gopher/3.0.9 ，  * compiled from source.",
