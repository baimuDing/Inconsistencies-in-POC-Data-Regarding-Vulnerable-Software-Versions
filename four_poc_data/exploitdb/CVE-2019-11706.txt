The issue is present in the libical implementation , which was ， forked from upstream libical version 0.47. ， The issue can be triggered remotely , when an attacker sends an specially ， crafted calendar attachment and does not require user interaction. It ， might be used by a remote attacker to crash the process or leak ， information from the client system via calendar replies. ， X41 did not perform a full test or audit on the software. ， Product Description ， Thunderbird is a free and open source email , newsfeed , chat , and ， calendaring client , that's easy to set up and customize. ， Analysis ， A type confusion in icalproperty.c ， icaltimezone_get_vtimezone_properties (  ) can be triggered while parsing a ， malformed calendar attachment. Missing sanity checks allows a TZID ， property to be parsed as ICALFLOATVALUE but it is later used as a ， string. ， The bug manifests with strdup ( tzid )  ; being called with tzid containing ， a bad pointer obtained by casting to char * from a float value , which ， typically means segfaulting by dereferencing a non-mapped memory page. ， An attacker might be able to deliver an input file containing specially ， crafted float values as TZID properties which could point to arbitrary ， memory positions. ， Certain conditions could allow to exfiltrate information via a calendar ， reply or other undetermined impact.",
