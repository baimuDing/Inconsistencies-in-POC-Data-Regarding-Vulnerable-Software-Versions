It is actively maintained by the PHPProjekt Development Team. It will run on most Linux and Unix variants , in addition to Microsoft Windows operating systems. ， Some of the PHProjekt scripts are only intended to be accessed by users who have been authenticated. However , it has been reported that it is possible for an unauthenticated attacker to access these scripts via a specially crafted web request. ， where the extraneous \"sms\" is included to be passed to the $ PHP_SELF variable as part of the PATH_INFO. This causes PHPProjekt to behave as though the attacker accessing the script is logged on to PHPProjekt as a legitimate user.",
