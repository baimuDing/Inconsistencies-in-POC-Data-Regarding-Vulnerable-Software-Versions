    "text": "ecve : CVE-2000-1095 ， title : Linux modutils 2.3.9 - 'modprobe' Arbitrary Command Execution - Linux local Exploit ， verified : Verified ， exploit_detail :  # source :  ，  # Modutils is a component of many linux systems that includes tools for using loadable kernel modules. One of these tools , modprobe , loads a set of modules that correspond to a provided \"name\" ( passed at the command line ) automatically. Modprobe version 2.3.9 and possibly others around it contain a vulnerability ( present since March 12 , 1999 ) that can lead to a local root compromise. ，  # The problem has to do with modprobe using popen (  ) to execute the \"echo\" program argumented with user input. Because popen (  ) relies on /bin/sh to parse the command string and execute \"echo\" , unescaped shell metacharacters can be included in user input to execute other commands. ，  # Though modprobe is not installed setuid root , this vulnerability can be exploited to gain root access provided the target system is using kmod. Kmod is a kernel facility that automatically executes the program 'modprobe' when a module is requested via request_module (  ) . ，  # One program that does this is the version of ping that ships with RedHat Linux 7.0. When a device is specified at the command-line that doesnt exist , request_module is called with the user-supplied arguments passed to the kernel. The kernel then takes the arguments and exec's modprobe with them. Arbitrary commands included in the argument for module name ( device name to ping ) are then executed when popen (  ) is called as root. ，  # Successful exploitation of this will yield root access for the attacker. ，  #  ! /bin/sh ， echo",
