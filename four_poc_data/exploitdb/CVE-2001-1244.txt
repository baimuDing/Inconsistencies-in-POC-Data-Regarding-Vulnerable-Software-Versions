The potential for attacks exists because in many cases only a small minimum value is enforced for the MSS. ， By setting the MSS to a low value ( such as 1 ) and making requests for large amounts of data through a TCP service , an attacker could effectively cause a denial of service by causing a large workload on a system. ，  * / ， / *  ，  *  ( C ) Copyright 2001 Darren Reed. ，  * maxseg.c ，  * /",
