    "text": "ecve : CVE-2002-0252 ， title : Apple QuickTime 5.0 - Content-Type Remote Buffer Overflow - Windows remote Exploit ， verified : Verified ， exploit_detail : // source :  ， Apple QuickTime is a freely available media player. It runs on a number of platforms including MacOS and Windows 9x/ME/NT/2000/XP operating systems. ， Apple QuickTime For Windows does not perform sufficient bounds checking of the \"Content-Type\" header. This issue may be exploited if a server responds with a maliciously crafted \"Content-Type\" header to a HTTP request for a media file. A \"Content-Type\" header of 500+ characters is sufficient to trigger this condition , causing stack variables to be overwritten in the process. ， This issue may allow a malicious server to execute arbitrary attacker-supplied code on the host of a client who makes a request for a media file. This may result in a remote compromise , possibly with elevated privileges ( depending on the environment ) . This issue may also allow a hostile server to introduce malicious code into a system running the vulnerable software. ， Exploitation of this issue requires that a user makes a request to the malicious server. However , this may also be exploited by a malicious host that is serving streaming media content to the client. ， It should be noted that the QuickTime player broadcasts information about the version and the operating environment via the \"User-Agent\" header of the HTTP request , which may aid a malicious server in successfully exploiting this issue. ， This vulnerability was reported for Japanese versions of Apple QuickTime Player , running on Japanese versions of the Microsoft Operating System. It is not known if other versions and environments are affected. ， / * ====================================================================== ， Apple QuickTimePlayer 5.02/5.01 Exploit ， Windows2000 Professional ( Service Pack 2 )  ， Windows98 Second Edition ， The Shadow Penguin Security (  ， Written by UNYUN ( unyun @ shadowpenguin.org )  ，  * /",
