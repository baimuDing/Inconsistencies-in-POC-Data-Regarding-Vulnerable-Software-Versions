If the ， user is logged in , the request will be executed by the Encryption Gateway on ， behalf of the logged in user. This could be used to change a user's settings , send emails or ， change contact informations. ， Affected :  ， Vulnerable :  ，  * 6.0.0_Build_371 ， No other version was tested but is is likely that older versions are affected as ， well.",
