    "text": "ecve : CVE-2003-1167 ， title : kpopup 0.9.x - Privileged Command Execution - Linux local Exploit ， verified : Verified ， exploit_detail : // source :  ， It has been alleged that it is possible for local attackers to gain root privileges through kpopup , which is is installed setuid root by default. According to the report , kpopup uses the system ( 3 ) C-library function insecurely to run other utilities on the system. In at least one instance , system ( 3 ) is called to invoke the binary killall ( 1 ) in a manner relying on the PATH environment variable. As the environment can be set by the unprivileged user when kpopup is executed , an arbitrary executable with the filename killall ( 1 ) can be executed. Many modern shells anticipate insecure use of this function by setuid/setgid processes and drop effective privileges if they do not match the real userid/gid of the process. It may be the case that kpopup first sets its real uid and gid to 0 before calling system , making this vulnerability exploitable. This has not been confirmed by Symantec. ， / * Local root exploit for kpopup ，  * by b0f www.b0f.net ，  * /",
