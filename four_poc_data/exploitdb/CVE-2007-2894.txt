The buffer-overflow issue occurs because the application fails to bounds-check user-supplied data before copying it into an insufficiently sized memory buffer. The denial-of-service vulnerability is caused by a divide-by-zero operation. ， A local attacker can exploit these issues to execute arbitrary code in the context of the affected application or to cause denial-of-service conditions. Failed exploit attempts of the buffer-overflow vulnerability will also result in denial-of-service conditions.",
