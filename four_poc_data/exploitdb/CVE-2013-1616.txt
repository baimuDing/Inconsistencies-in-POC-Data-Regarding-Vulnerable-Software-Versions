Powered by Insight , Symantecs ， innovative reputation based malware filtering technology , Web Gateway relies on ， a global network of greater than 210 million systems to identify new threats ， before they cause disruption in organizations.\" ， URL :  ， Business recommendation :  ， SEC Consult has identified several vulnerabilities within the components of ， Symantec Web Gateway in the course of a short crash test. Some components have ， been spot-checked , while others have not been tested at all. ， Several of the discovered vulnerabilities below can be chained together in ， order to run arbitrary commands with the privileges of the \"root\" user on the ， appliance. ， An attacker can get unauthorized access to the appliance and plant backdoors or ， access configuration files containing credentials for other systems ( eg. Active ， Directory/LDAP credentials ) which can be used in further attacks. ， Since all web traffic passes through the appliance , interception of HTTP as ， well as the plaintext form of HTTPS traffic ( if SSL Deep Inspection feature in ， use )  , including sensitive information like passwords and session cookies is ， possible. ， If SSL Deep Inspection is enabled , the appliance holds a private key for a ， Certificate Authority ( CA ) certificate that is installed/trusted on all ， workstations in the company. If this private key is compromised by an attacker ,  ， arbitrary certificates can be signed. These certificates will then pass ， validation on the client machines , enabling in various attacks targeting ， clients ( further MITM attacks , phishing , evilgrade , ... ) . ， The recommendation of SEC Consult is to switch off the product until a ， comprehensive security audit based on a security source code review has been ， performed and all identified security deficiencies have been resolved by the ， vendor. ， Vulnerability overview/description :  ， 1 ) Reflected Cross Site Scripting ( XSS )  ( CVE-2013-4670 )  ， A reflected cross site scripting vulnerability was found. This allows ， effective session hijacking attacks of administrator session cookies. ， 2 ) Persistent Cross Site Scripting ( XSS )  ( CVE-2013-4670 )  ， Moreover a persistent cross site scripting vulnerability allows an ， unauthenticated user to inject script code into the administration interface. ， This script code will be executed once an administrator visits the ， administration interface. ， 3 ) OS Command Injection ( CVE-2013-1616 )  ， Multiple OS command injection vulnerabilities were discovered. Authenticated ， users can execute arbitrary commands on the underlying operating system with ， the privileges of the \"apache\" operating system user. ， This can be used to get persistent access to the affected system ( eg. by ， planting backdoors )  , accessing all kinds of locally stored information or ， interception of web traffic that passes through the appliance. ， 4 ) Security Misconfiguration ( CVE-2013-4672 )  ， Unprivileged operating system users ( eg. apache ) can gain root privileges ， due to a misconfiguration of the sudo program. ， 5 ) SQL Injection ( CVE-2013-1617 )  ， Several SQL injection vulnerabilities were identified that allow an ， authenticated administrator to issue manipulated SQL commands. ， 6 ) Cross Site Request Forgery ( CVE-2013-4671 )  ， The cross site request forgery protection implemented can be bypassed easily. ， Using this vulnerability , an attacker can issue requests in the context of ， administrative user sessions. ， Several of the vulnerabilities above can be chained together by an ， unauthenticated attacker in order to run arbitrary commands with the ， privileges of the \"root\" operating system user on the appliance. ， Proof of concept :  ， 1 ) Reflected Cross Site Scripting ( XSS )  ( CVE-2013-4670 )  ， The following URL demonstrates a reflected cross site scripting vulnerability :  ， 2 ) Persistent Cross Site Scripting ( XSS )  ( CVE-2013-4670 )  ， The \"blocked.php\" page which is accessible without authentication allows to ， inject script code to the \"Blocking Feedback\" functionality on the ， administration interface. The following URL demonstrates this issue. The ， payload of the parameter \"u\" will be stored permanently :  ， 3 ) OS Command Injection ( CVE-2013-1616 )  ， The functionality to change the hostname as well as the \"Test Ping\" ， functionality allow to inject commands enclosed in backticks ( ` ) . These commands ， are run as the system user \"apache\". ， Affected scripts : /spywall/nameConfig.php ， /spywall/networkConfig.php ， Detailed proof of concept exploits have beem removed for this vulnerability. ， 4 ) Security Misconfiguration ( CVE-2013-4672 )  ， The /etc/sudoers file allows the users \"apache\" and \"admin\" to run several ， critical commands with root privileges. As the user \"apache\" is able to run ， commands like \"chmod\" , \"chown\" and \"insmod\" without the need of a password ,  ， an attacker that is able to issue commands as this user ( see 3 ) can effectively ， gain root privileges. ， 5 ) SQL Injection ( CVE-2013-1617 )  ， The following URLs demonstrate the SQL injection flaws found by",
