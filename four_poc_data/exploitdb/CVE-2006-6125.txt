Failed attempts will likely crash the kernel , resulting in denial-of-service conditions. ， Although the WG311v1ND5.SYS driver is used primarily on Microsoft Windows , users of Linux and BSD machines running the 'ndiswrapper' tool should determine if they are using a vulnerable instance of the driver. ， Version 2.3.1.10 of the WG311v1ND5.SYS driver is vulnerable to this issue ; other versions may also be affected. ， require 'msf/core' ， module Msf",
