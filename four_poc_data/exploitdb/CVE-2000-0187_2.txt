    "text": "ecve : CVE-2000-0187 ， title : Alex Heiphetz Group eZshopper 3.0 - Remote Command Execution - Multiple remote Exploit ， verified : Verified ， exploit_detail : source :  ， EZShopper is a perl-based E-Commerce software package offered by Alex Heiphetz Group , Inc. It is possible to remotely compromise a host due to a lack of checks on user input passed directly to the open (  ) call. This vulnerability exists in two scripts shipped with EZShopper , loadpage.cgi and search.cgi. ， In the first vulnerability , the variable passed to open (  ) is called \"file\" and is submitted to a script called loadpage.cgi. There are no checks on \"file\" , meaning that if \"../\" preceed an arbitrary filename/path as the file variable , those \"../\" paths will be followed and the arbitrary file anywhere on the filesystem will be displayed ( provided that the uid of the webserver has access to them.. ) . If pipes are included in the variable , arbitrary commands can be executed on the target host possibly giving remote access to the attacker with the uid of the webserver ( usually 'nobody' ) . ， The second vulnerability is identical in nature to the first but is in the \"search.cgi\" script. In search.cgi , no checks are made on user input variables 'template' and 'database' ( passed to open (  )  ) . As a result , it is possible to view files or execute commands on the host through search.cgi as well. ，  #  ! ",
