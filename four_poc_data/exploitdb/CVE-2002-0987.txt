    "text": "ecve : CVE-2002-0987 ， title : Caldera X Server 7.1/8.0 - External Program Privileged Invocation - Unix local Exploit ， verified : Verified ， exploit_detail : source :  ， Caldera's X Server implementation invokes external commands without dropping existing privilege levels. Xserver calls xkbcomp , and other related utilities , in an unsecure manner using the popen (  ) or system (  ) calls. While this would not typically be an issue , as execution of the binary would typically result in the execution of code in the security context of the invoking user , the xkbcomp utility is executed by the Xserver process before privileges are dropped. ， This weakness can be exploited by local attacker to execute arbitrary commands with elevated privileges. ，  $ Xserver -xkbdir 'id > /tmp/I_WAS_HERE ; ' ，  [ exit X server ]  ，  $ grep root /tmp/I_WAS_HERE",
