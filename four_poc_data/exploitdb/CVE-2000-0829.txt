    "text": "ecve : CVE-2000-0829 ， title : RedHat Linux 6.1 i386 - Tmpwatch Recursive Write Denial of Service - Linux dos Exploit ， verified : Verified ， exploit_detail : source :  ， Any user with write access to /tmp or /var/tmp , can induce tmpwatch to cause Red Hat ( and others runnng tmpwatch from cron ) to stop responding , and possibly require a hard reboot. This is accomplished by creating a directory tree many ( ie. ~ 6000 ) nodes deep in /tmp. For each level of the directory in /tmp , tmpwatch will fork (  ) a new copy of itself. ， Red Hat affected versions :  ， Red Hat Linux 7.0 ( tmpwatch v.2.5.1 )  ， Red Hat Linux 6.2 ( tmpwatch v.2.2 )  ， Note :  ，  ( excerpted from Internet Security Systems Security Advisory )  ， \"Source code comparison between the Red Hat Linux 6.2 and 7.0 tmpwatch packages ， suggests this vulnerability was recognized and a fix was attempted. However ,  ， the fix is incorrect , and the vulnerability is still exploitable. ， Do not use the -fuser or -s options with tmpwatch.\" ， -START-cut- : a.c ( mode 644 )  ， // make lots of directories. ， // ./a < # of-dirs> ， // ./a with no arguments to delete dirs. ， main ( int argc , char * argv [  ]  )  ， int c=0 , d=0 ;  ， chdir ( \"..\" )  ; ",
