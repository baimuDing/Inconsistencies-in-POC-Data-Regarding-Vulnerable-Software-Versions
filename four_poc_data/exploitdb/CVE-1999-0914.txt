The first is in the bootp server , the second in the FTP client. ， Bootpd version 2.4.3 ( and earlier ) is prone to a number of buffer overflow conditions that may allow a remote attacker to fully compromise a host running a vulnerable version. This is due to improper bounds checking in the handling of the boot file/location specified in a bootp request packet , and in the error ， logging facility. This vulnerability is specific to the bootp daemon and any Unix distributions that ship with the affected version should be considered vulnerable. ， A buffer overflow condition also exists in the netstd FTP client , which may be exploited by a local attacker to potentially elevate privileges. ， / *  ，  * Bootpd Exploit against debian linux 1.3 and 2.0 and possibly other ，  *  ( C ) 1998 Willem Pinckaers W.H.J.Pinckaers @ cpedu.rug.nl ，  * /",
