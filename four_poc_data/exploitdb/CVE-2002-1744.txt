However , this script ( CodeBrws.asp ) does not adequately filter unicode representations of directory traversals. For example , an attacker can break out of the sample script directory by substituting '%c0%ae%c0%ae' for '..' in a dot-dot-slash directory traversal attack. ， It has been demonstrated that this issue may be exploited to map out the directory structure of the filesystem on a host running the vulnerable script. ， The following example was also provided to demonstrate that the directory structure may be mapped out using this vulnerability :  ， Request :  ， Response : Microsoft VBScript runtime ( 0x800A004C ) Path not found ， Request :  ， Response : Microsoft VBScript runtime ( 0x800A0035 ) File not found",
