The problem occurs due to insufficient bounds checking when handling overly long HTTP requests. As a result , it may be possible for a remote attacker to corrupt sensitive process data in such a way that the execution flow of Monit can be controlled. ， Successful exploitation of this condition could potentially allow for the execution of arbitrary code with root privileges. ， // Michel ,  ，  #  ! /usr/bin/perl ，  # Monit 4.1 ( possibly earlier too ) remote shell exploit ( HTTP )  ，  #  ( C ) 2004 by Shadowinteger <shadowinteger @ sentinix.org> ，  # Verbatim copying , distribution and/or modification of this ，  # code is permitted without restriction. ，  # THIS SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\" , WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY ，  # KIND , EXPRESS OR IMPLIED , INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE ，  # WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY , FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR ，  # PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
