PTK is included within the SANS Investigative Forensic Toolkit ，  ( SIFT ) Workstation. ， This application is vulnerable to multiple input validation attacks. The ， possibility to exploit these findings introduces several malicious scenarios. ， For instance , a criminal may abuse this specific vulnerability to modify ， the evidence of the crime , compromising the digital investigation workstation. ， Even if the original evidence should be accessed only in read-only mode ,  ， using also hardware write blockers according to forensic best practices ,  ， several malicious scenarios are possible with just the alteration of the ， working copy image. Additionally , a payload could be crafted to hide ,  ， or alter , just the information presented to the analyst , something which ， would not be evident unless the same image is analyzed with a tool not ， vulnerable to the attack. ， In our research , we have developed a reliable",
