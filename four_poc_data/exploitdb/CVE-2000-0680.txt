    "text": "ecve : CVE-2000-0680 ， title : CVS Kit CVS Server 1.10.8 - 'Checkin.prog' Binary Execution - Unix local Exploit ， verified : Verified ， exploit_detail : source :  ， A CVS committer can execute arbitrary binaries by using Checkin.prog. Usually CVS/Checkin.prog in a working directory is copied from CVSROOT/modules when the directory is \"checkout\"ed and it is sent back to the server and executed with committing. Note that when it is executed , committed files exist in the current directory. ， Since a working directory can be modified by a committer , Checkin.prog may be modified or even newly created. If a malicious committer does this , cvs server executes the modified Checkin.prog. Also note that the committer can create an arbitrary binary file by `cvs add -kb' and `cvs commit'. The malicious committer can execute the recently committed binary file via Checkin.prog triggered by the `cvs commit'. ， % cvs -d : pserver : test @ localhost : /tmp/cvs -f co somemodule ， cvs server : Updating somemodule ， % cd somemodule ， % cp /bin/ls binary ， % cvs add -kb binary ， cvs server : scheduling file `binary' for addition ， cvs server : use 'cvs commit' to add this file permanently",
