    "text": "ecve : CVE-2001-0906 ， title : teTeX 1.0.7 - Filters Temporary File Race Condition - Linux local Exploit ， verified : Verified ， exploit_detail : / *  ， source :  ， teTeX is a TeX distribution for UNIX compatible systems. ， A race condition vulnerability exists in the temporary file handling method used by some teTeX filters. The problem exists because in some cases temporary files are created world-writeable with a predictable filename based on the process ID of the filter. If an attacker is able to determine the name of a temporary file used during the program's operation , a symbolic link could be created pointing to a file writeable by the user running the filter. ， When the filters are used by an application that runs with elevated privileges such as LPRng , the potential impact of the attack could become more significant. A local attacker could exploit this vulnerability to cause LPRng to execute arbitrary commands with its elevated privileges. ，  * / ， Redhat 7.0 ( mebe 7.1 ? )  ， LPRng-3.7.4-23 ( and earlier ) + tetex-1.0.7-7 ( and earlier? )  ， Insecure tmp file privilege elevation vulnerability. ， Allows uid/gid lp and root groups on LPRng-3.6.24 and earlier ， Please note :  ， -rwxr-xr-x 1 lp lp 444472 Jun 14 22 : 05 /usr/bin/lpq *  ， -rwxr-xr-x 1 lp lp 441624 Jun 14 22 : 05 /usr/bin/lprm *  ， -rwxr-xr-x 1 lp lp 459160 Jun 14 22 : 05 /usr/bin/lpr *  ， -rwxr-xr-x 1 lp lp 448120 Jun 14 22 : 05 /usr/bin/lpstat *  ， -rwxr-xr-x 1 lp lp 448320 Jun 14 22 : 05 /usr/sbin/lpc *  ， this program allows trojan code to be planted on the machine it is ， executed on. ， tmp file handling done badly in helper application ( dvi",
