It uses the standard Unix rsh and rcp commands. rsh ( ie \"remote shell\" ) allows the execution of a non-interactive program on another system running the server component , 'rshd'. The daemon listens for connections coming from an rsh command through TCP/IP , and , on receiving a connection , validates access and executes the specified program. ， Upon connecting to the daemon , rsh will supply a port number for the daemon to send standard error data. If the port number specified is invalid , Winsock RSHD/NT will attempt to connect to the invalid port and all port numbers below 1024 ( including negative port numbers ) . Potentially consuming CPU resources and leading to a denial of service. ， WRSHDNT 2.20.00 CPU overusage demo ， jimmers @ yandex.ru ，  * /",
