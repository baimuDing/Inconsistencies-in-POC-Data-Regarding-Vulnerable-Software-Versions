    "text": "ecve : CVE-1999-1518 ， title : BSD/Linux Kernel 2.3 ( BSD/OS 4.0 / FreeBSD 3.2 / NetBSD 1.4 ) - Shared Memory Denial of Service - BSD dos Exploit ， verified : Verified ， exploit_detail : / *  ， source :  ， Operating systems with a shared memory implementation based on or influenced by the 4.4BSD code may be vulnerable to a denial of service attack The problem exists because you can mmap (  ) or shmget (  ) as much memory as you'd like bypassing rlimits. When you trigger pagefaults , the system will begin allocating the memory ( it's not actually allocated at first ) and run out. With System V IPC the memory remains allocated even after the process has stopped running. ，  * / ， / *  ，  * This program can be used to exploit DoS bugs in the VM systems or utility ，  * sets of certain OS's. ，  * Common problems :  ，  * 1. The system does not check rlimits for mmap and shmget ( FreeBSD )  ，  * 2. The system never bothers to offer the ability to set the rlimits for ，  * virtual memory via shells , login process , or otherwise. ( Linux )  ，  * 3. b. The system does not actually allocate shared memory until a page fault ，  * is triggered ( this could be argued to be a feature - Linux ,  * BSD )  ，  * a. The system does not watch to make sure you don't share more memory ，  * than exists. ( Linux , Irix , BSD? )  ，  * 4. With System V IPC , shared memory persists even after the process is ，  * gone. So even though the kernel may kill the process after it exhausts all ，  * memory from page faults , there still is 0 memory left for the system. ，  *  ( All )  ，  * This program should compile on any architecture. SGI Irix is not ，  * vulnerable. From reading The Design and Implementation of 4.4BSD it sounds ，  * as if the BSDs should all be vulnerable. FreeBSD will mmap as much memory ，  * as you tell it. I haven't tried page faulting the memory , as the system is ，  * not mine. I'd be very interested to hear about OpenBSD... ，  * This program is provided for vulnerability evaluation ONLY. DoS's aren't ，  * cool , funny , or anything else. Don't use this on a machine that isn't ，  * yours !  !  !  ，  * /",
