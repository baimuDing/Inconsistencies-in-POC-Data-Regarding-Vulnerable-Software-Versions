It is not intended to be used for any ， // unauthorized or illicit purpose. Any testing done with this tool must ， // be limited to systems that you own or are explicitly authorized to ， // test. ， // By utilizing or possessing this code , you assume any and all ， // responsibility for damage that results. The author will not be held ， // responsible , under any circumstances , for damage that arises from your ， // possession or use of this code. ， // Tested :  ， // Firefox 1.5.0.1 ， // Windows Media Player 10 ， // Windows XP SP2 ( US )  ， // The Windows Media Player plug-in for non-Microsoft browsers ( Firefox ,  ， // Opera , etc. ) suffers from an exploitable overflow in its handling of ， // EMBED tags. Specifically , a very long SRC property on such a tag can ， // lead to an overflow that will corrupt a structured exception handling ， // frame. ， // The SEH frame is the vector of control that I exploit. Fortunately ,  ， // DEP is turned off for non-Microsoft code , so there's no issue there. ， // That's really a shame , because such a move would've made an already ， // difficult exploit much harder. ， // One of the reasons the exploit is tough is because the overrun buffer ， // ( the SRC attribute ) is seriously mangled before it is handled by the ， // plug-in. In particular , any character with the sign bit set ( > 0x7F )  ， // is replaced. ， // We could do as the creative wizards like HD Moore suggest and use an ， // alphanumeric payload with some cute SEH tricks. Let me rephrase :  ， // YOU could do as the creative wizards suggest. Meanwhile , I'm perfectly ， // content to throw my code in another buffer and get around all the silly ， // alpha-numeric sanitation. Sure beats devoting hours to beating it ， // with fancy shellcode , all for a",
