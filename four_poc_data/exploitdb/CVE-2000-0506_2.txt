These \"Capabilities\" are an additional form of privilege control to enable more specific control over what priviliged processes can do. Capabilities are implemented as three ( fairly large ) bitfields , which each bit representing a specific action a privileged process can perform. By setting specific bits , the actions of priviliged processes can be controlled -- access can be granted for various functions only to the specific parts of a program that require them. It is a security measure. The problem is that capabilities are copied with fork (  ) execs , meaning that if capabilities are modified by a parent process , they can be carried over. The way that this can be exploited is by setting all of the capabilities to zero ( meaning , all of the bits are off ) in each of the three bitfields and then executing a setuid program that attempts to drop priviliges before executing code that could be dangerous if run as root , such as what sendmail does. When sendmail attempts to drop priviliges using setuid ( getuid (  )  )  , it fails not having the capabilities required to do so in its bitfields. It continues executing with superuser priviliges , and can run a users .forward file as root leading to a complete compromise. Procmail can also be exploited in this manner. ，  #  ! /bin/sh",
