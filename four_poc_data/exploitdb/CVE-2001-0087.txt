    "text": "ecve : CVE-2001-0087 ， title : Itetris 1.6.1/1.6.2 - Privileged Arbitrary Command Execution - Linux local Exploit ， verified : Verified ， exploit_detail : // source :  ， Itetris , or \"Intelligent Tetris\" , is a clone of the popular Tetris puzzle game for linux systems. The svgalib version of Itetris is installed setuid root so that it may access video hardware when run by a regular user. Itetris contains a vulnerability which may allow unprivileged users to execute arbitrary commands as root. ， Itetris uses the system (  ) function to execute gunzip when uncompressing font files. Unfortuntely it does so in a very insecure way -- relying on gunzip being located in directories specified in the PATH environment variable. It is possible to exploit this vulnerability if an attacker sets PATH to include a directory under his/her control in which a \"gunzip\" is found instead of or before the real location , eg :  ， PATH=/tmp/hacker :  $ PATH ， Any program with the filename \"gunzip\" in /tmp/hacker would then be executed with Itetris' effective privileges. This vulnerability can be exploited to gain super user access and completely compromise the victim host. ， / *  (  *  ) itetris [ v1.6.2 ] local root exploit , by : v9 [ v9 @ fakehalo.org ] . this will ， give you root on systems that have the itetris game installed. the program ， is installed setuid ( 0 ) /root due to svgalib. this exploits a system (  ) call ， mixed with bad ../ protection , which makes this possible -- considering it ， needs a font file to end with \".gz\" to run gunzip. ， explaination ( egafont.c )  :  ，  [ 199/360 ]  : char * FontPath ,  * FontPath1 ;  ，  [ 237/360 ]  : unzipped = strcasecmp ( FontPath+fontheight-3 , \".gz\" )  ;  ，  [ 246/360 ]  : s",
