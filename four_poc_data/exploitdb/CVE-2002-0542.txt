The tasks are for the purpose of summarizing system information. ， The mail ( 1 ) utility is used to send the summaries to the root user. This utility supports escaped characters in message text indicating commands to be executed during processing. ， If attacker-supplied data can be included in the message text passed to mail ( 1 )  , commands specified by the attacker may be executed as root. If the attacker embeds the escape sequence followed by an arbitrary command in this data , the commands will be executed as root when the cron task runs. It is possible for an attacker to embed data in filenames , which are included in the emails. ，  * / ， / *  ，  *  ( c ) 2002 venglin @ freebsd.lublin.pl ，  * OpenBSD 3.0 ( before 08 Apr 2002 )  ，  * /etc/security + /usr/bin/mail local root exploit ，  * Run the exploit and wait for /etc/daily executed from crontab. ，  * /bin/sh will be suid root next day morning. ，  * Credit goes to urbanek @ openbsd.cz for discovering vulnerability. ，  * /",
