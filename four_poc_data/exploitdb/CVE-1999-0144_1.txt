By specifying a large number of addresses in the recipient field ( RCPT )  , qmail will stop responding. ， This behaviour is due to the dynamically allocated memory being exhausted. ， The condition occurs in situations where resource limits are not imposed on the server process. ， Many systems may be running qmail without resource limits. The existence of working exploit code poses a threat to these vulnerable qmail servers. ， Once affected , a restart of the qmail smtp service is required in order to gain normal functionality. ， It should be noted that this type of threat is not limited to qmail. Resource exhaustion attacks can be used against many internet services by remote attackers. ，  #  ! /usr/local/bin/perl -w ，  #  $ Id : qmail.pl , v 1.4 1997/06/12 02 : 12 : 42 super Exp $  ， require 5.002 ;  ， use strict ;  ， use Socket ; ",
