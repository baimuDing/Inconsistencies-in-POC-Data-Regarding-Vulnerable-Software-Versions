    "text": "ecve : CVE-2016-10009 ， title : OpenSSH < 7.4 - agent Protocol Arbitrary Library Loading - Linux remote Exploit ， verified : Verified ， exploit_detail : Source :  ， The OpenSSH agent permits its clients to load PKCS11 providers using the commands SSH_AGENTC_ADD_SMARTCARD_KEY and SSH_AGENTC_ADD_SMARTCARD_KEY_CONSTRAINED if OpenSSH was compiled with the ENABLE_PKCS11 flag ( normally enabled ) and the agent isn't locked. For these commands , the client has to specify a provider name. The agent passes this provider name to a subprocess ( via ssh-agent.c : process_add_smartcard_key -> ssh-pkcs11-client.c : pkcs11_add_provider -> ssh-pkcs11-client.c : send_msg )  , and the subprocess receives it and passes it to dlopen (  )  ( via ssh-pkcs11-helper.c : process -> ssh-pkcs11-helper.c : process_add -> ssh-pkcs11.c : pkcs11_add_provider -> dlopen ) . No checks are performed on the provider name , apart from testing whether that provider is already loaded. ， This means that , if a user connects to a malicious SSH server with agent forwarding enabled and the malicious server has the ability to place a file with attacker-controlled contents in the victim's filesystem , the SSH server can execute code on the user's machine. ， To",
