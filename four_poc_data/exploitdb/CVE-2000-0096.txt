This issue allows users already in possession of a username and password for a POP account to compromise the server running the qpopper daemon. ， The problem lies in the code that handles the 'LIST' command available to logged-in users. By providing an overly long argument , an attacker may cause a buffer to overflow. As a result , the attacker can gain access with the user ID ( UID ) of the user whose account is being used for the attack and with the group ID ( GID ) mail. ， This will allow remote attackers to access the server itself and possibly ( depending on how the computer is configured ) to read other users' mail via the GID mail. ， / *  ，  *  !
