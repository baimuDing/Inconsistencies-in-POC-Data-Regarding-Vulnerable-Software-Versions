The code which handles this variable does not place a restriction on its size. At least one of the CDE programs which rely on this variable do not have sufficient bounds checking in place for this variable. This can result in a buffer overflow. The program in question is dtsession. ， Due to the fact that dtsession is running setuid root and does not remove the root privilege ( at least as tested on Solaris )  , the overflow can lead to local root compromise. ，  * / ， / *  ，  * ovsession.c ，  * Job de Haas ，  *  ( C ) ITSX BV 1999 ，  * Some proof of concept code ( == really ugly , barely working ) at exploiting ，  * an overflow in libtt.so when parsing the TT_SESSION string. ，  * Only tested on a Solaris 2.6 sun4c sparc , with and without patch 105802-07 ，  * based loosly on code by horizon <jmcdonal @ unf.edu> ，  * Somehow the overflow is very sensitive to caching of the stack. To see that ，  * it really does work , run it in a debugger and set a break point in tt_open (  )  ，  * when that is reached , set a breakpoint in sscanf and continue. When that is ，  * reached continue again and it will either crash or execute a shell. ，  * /",
