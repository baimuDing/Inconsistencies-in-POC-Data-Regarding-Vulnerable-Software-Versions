This problem exists in most ， modern configuration due to the fact that it takes much longer to calculate SHA256/SHA512 hash than BLOWFISH hash. ， CVE-ID ， CVE-2016-6210 ， Tested versions ， This issue was tested on : opensshd-7.2p2 ( should be possible on most earlier versions as well ) . ， Fix ， This issue was reported to OPENSSH developer group and they have sent a patch ( don't know if patch was released yet ) . ，  ( thanks to 'dtucker (  ) zip com au' for his quick reply and fix suggestion ) . ， Details ， When SSHD tries to authenticate a non-existing user , it will pick up a fake password structure hardcoded in the SSHD ， source code. On this hard coded password structure the password hash is based on BLOWFISH (  $ 2 ) algorithm. ， If real users passwords are hashed using SHA256/SHA512 , then sending large passwords ( 10KB ) will result in shorter ， response time from the server for non-existing users. ， Sample",
