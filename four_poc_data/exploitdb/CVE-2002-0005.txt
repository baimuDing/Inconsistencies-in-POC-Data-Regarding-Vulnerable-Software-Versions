    "text": "ecve : CVE-2002-0005 ， title : AOL Instant Messenger 4.x - Remote Buffer Overflow - Windows remote Exploit ， verified : Verified ， exploit_detail : source :  ， AOL Instant Messenger ( AIM ) is a real time messaging service. ， The vulnerability exists in the way that AIM parses a game request with a TLV ( type , length , value ) type of 0x2711. This type of game request is prone to a buffer overflow which could allow a remote user to obtain the same privileges of the user who is currently logged on. ， It is important to note that there is currently no way for an AIM user to block this type of request. ， AOL has made modifications to their AIM servers to prevent this vulnerability from being exploited through their servers. However , the underlying problem still exists in the client software which could still be exploited using something similar to a man in the middle attack or if an attacker can bypass the filters on the AIM servers.",
