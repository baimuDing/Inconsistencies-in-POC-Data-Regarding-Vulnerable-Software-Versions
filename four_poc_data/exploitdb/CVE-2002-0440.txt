It is capable of scanning incoming content over HTTP , SMTP and FTP for viruses and malicious code. ， A vulnerability has been reported in some versions of VirusWall. An option exists called \"Skip scanning if Content-length equals 0\" , which is enabled by default. A malicious web server may return infected content with this header set to 0 , and bypass the VirusWall scanner. As many popular client programs will ignore this header and display the content , this may allow malicious content to bypass VirusWall and still be interpreted by a client system. ， Other versions of VirusWall may share this vulnerability.
