These ， products enable you to see and manage physical and virtual endpoints ， including servers , desktops , notebooks , smartphones , tablets and ， specialized equipment such as point-of-sale devices , ATMs and ， self-service kiosks. Now you can rapidly remediate , protect and report ， on endpoints in near real time. ，  ( from the vendor's homepage )  ， More Details ， Systems that run IBM Endpoint Manager ( IEM , formerly Tivoli Endpoint ， Manager , or TEM ) components , such as TEM Root Servers or TEM Relays ,  ， typically serve HTTP and HTTPS on port 52311. There , the server or relay ， diagnostics page is normally accessible at the path /rd. That page can ， be accessed without authentication and lets users query and modify ， different information. For example , a TEM Relay can be instructed to ， gather a specific version of a certain Fixlet site by requesting a URL ， such as the following :  ， BESGatherMirrorNew.exe/-gatherversion ， ?Body=GatherSpecifiedVersion ， &url= ， &version=1 ， &useCRC=0 ， The URL parameter url is susceptible to cross-site scripting. When the ， following URL is requested , the browser executes the JavaScript code ， provided in the parameter :  ， BESGatherMirrorNew.exe/-gatherversion ， ?Body=GatherSpecifiedVersion ， &version=1 ， &url= ， &version=1 ， &useCRC=0 ， The value of that parameter is also stored in the TEM Relay's site list ,  ， so that the embedded JavaScript code is executed whenever the ， diagnostics page is opened in a browser :  ，  $ curl ，  [ ... ]  ， <select NAME=\"url\"> ，  [ ... ]  ， <option> ， </select>",
