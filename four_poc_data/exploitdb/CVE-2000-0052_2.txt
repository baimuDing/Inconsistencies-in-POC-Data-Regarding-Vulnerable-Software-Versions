Both userhelper and PAM follow \"..\" paths and userhelper allows you to specifiy a program to execute as an argument to the -w parameter ( which is expected to have an entry in /etc/security/console.apps ) . Because of this , it's possible to specifiy a program such as \"../../../tmp/myprog\" , which would ( to userhelper ) be \"/etc/security/console.apps/../../../tmp/myprog\". If \"myprog\" exists , PAM will then try to execute it ( with the same filename ) . PAM first does a check to see if the configuration file for \"../../../tmp/myprog\" is in /etc/pam.d/ but also follows \"..\" directories -- to an attacker's custom pam configuration file. Specified inside the malicious configuration file ( /tmp/myprog ) would be arbitrary shared libraries to be opened with setuid privileges. The arbitrary libraries can be created by an attacker specifically to compromise superuser access , activating upon dlopen (  ) by PAM. ， This vulnerability also affects Mandrake Linux versions 6.0 and 6.1 , as well as versions of TurboLinux Linux , version 6.0.2 and prior. ， / *  ，  * pam-mdk.c ( C ) 2000 Paulo Ribeiro ，  * DESCRIPTION :  ，  * ----------- ，  * Mandrake Linux 6.1 has the same problem as Red Hat Linux 6.x but its ，  * exploit ( pamslam.sh ) doesn't work on it ( at least on my machine ) . So ,  ，  * I created this C program based on it which exploits PAM/userhelper ，  * and gives you UID 0. ，  * SYSTEMS TESTED :  ，  * -------------- ，  * Red Hat Linux 6.0 , Red Hat Linux 6.1 , Mandrake Linux 6.1. ，  * RESULTS :  ，  * ------- ，  *  [ prrar @ linux prrar ]  $ id ，  * uid=501 ( prrar ) gid=501 ( prrar ) groups=501 ( prrar )  ，  *  [ prrar @ linux prrar ]  $ gcc pam-mdk.c -o pam-mdk ，  *  [ prrar @ linux prrar ]  $ ./pam-mdk ，  * sh-2.03 # id ，  * uid=0 ( root ) gid=501 ( prrar ) groups=501 ( prrar )  ，  * sh-2.03 #  ，  * /",
