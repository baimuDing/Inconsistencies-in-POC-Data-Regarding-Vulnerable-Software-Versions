It may also be possible for attackers to crash xinetd , which would result in a denial of service for all services started by inetd ( telnet , ftp , etc ) . ， / *  ，  * xinetd-2.1.8.9pre11-1 Linux x86 remote root exploit ，  * by qitest1 28/06/2001 ，  * This is a proof of concept code for the exploitation of the bof ，  * present in xinetd-2.1.8.9pre11-1.
