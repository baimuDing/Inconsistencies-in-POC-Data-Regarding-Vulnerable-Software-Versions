This issue is different than the vulnerability described in BID 7230. This vulnerability could permit remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via vulnerable versions of Sendmail. ，  * / ， / * Local exploit for the old sendmail vuln found by lcamtuf in 8.12.9 and below. ，  * by Gyan Chawdhary , gunnu45 @ hotmail.com ，  * Greets ，  * sorbo : all the credits go to him for the ideas regarding the exploitation.. ，  * lcamtuf : for finding such a subtle bug .. ，  * dvorak , scut , gera .. ，  * Theory ，  * The problem lies in the prescan function. When returnnull is called it does ，  * not do a check to see if p > addr. This results into p pointing past the ，  * array by one byte into the size field tag of the next malloc chunk ，  *  ( due to the fact that bufp is allocated in the heap. This value is assigned ，  * to * delimptr which is used by invalidaddr in parseaddr. The invalidaddr ，  * function checks for addresses containing characters used by macros. During ，  * the parsing of the addrs by invalidaddr , it also checks for illegal chars ，  * in the adress itself , and if found they are replaced with ，  * BAD_CHAR_REPLACEMENT ( depending on the size field of the allocation of our ，  * buffer ) which is defined as \"?\" ( hex 3f ) Due to the offbyone overflow in ，  * prescan , invalidaddr modifies our chunk value which is later used by free (  )  ，  * when sm_free ( bufp ) is called , in return making sendmail vomit !  !  !  ! . ，  * Read the code for details. ，  * Gyan ，  * /",
