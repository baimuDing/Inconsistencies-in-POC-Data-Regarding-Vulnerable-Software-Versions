Ettlinger ( Office Vienna )  ， SEC Consult Vulnerability Lab ， An integrated part of SEC Consult ， Bangkok - Berlin - Linz - Montreal - Moscow ， Singapore - Vienna ( HQ ) - Vilnius - Zurich ， Vendor description :  ， \"Unlike other mobile file access and collaborative file sharing solutions , Micro ， Focus Filr has been designed with the enterprise in mind , resulting in less ， administration , better security and more productive users.\" ， URL :  ， Business recommendation :  ， During a very quick security check several vulnerabilities with high impact ， have been discovered. SEC Consult recommends to immediately apply the patches ， provided by Micro Focus to address these issues. ， Please note that since SEC Consult did not conduct a thorough technical security ， check SEC Consult cannot make a statement regarding the overall security of the ， Micro Focus Filr appliance. ， Vulnerability overview/description :  ， During a quick security check several vulnerabilities have been identified that ， ultimately allow an attacker to completely compromise the appliance :  ， 1 ) Cross Site Request Forgery ( CSRF ) - CVE-2016-1607 ， Several functions within the appliance's administative interface lack protection ， against CSRF attacks. This allows an attacker who targets an authenticated ， administrator to reconfigure the appliance. ， 2 ) OS Command Injection - CVE-2016-1608 ， The appliance administrative interface allows an authenticated attacker to ， execute arbitrary operating system commands. Please note that an attacker can ， combine this vulnerability with vulnerability # 1. In this scenario , an attacker ， does not need to be authenticated. ， 3 ) Insecure System Design ， The appliance uses a Jetty application server to provide the appliance ， administration interface. This application server is started as the superuser ， \"root\". Please note that combined with vulnerability # 1 and # 2 an attacker can ， run commands as the superuser \"root\" without the need for any authentication. ， For vendor remark on # 3 see solution section. ， 4 ) Persistent Cross-Site Scripting - CVE-2016-1609 ， The Filr web interface uses a blacklist filter to try to strip any JavaScript ， code from user input. However , this filter can be bypassed to persistently ， inject JavaScript code into the Filr web interface. ， 5 ) Missing Cookie Flags ， The httpOnly cookie flag is not set for any session cookies set by both the ， administrative appliance web interface and the Filr web interface. Please note ， that combined with vulnerability # 4 an attacker can steal session cookies of ， both the appliance administration interface and the Filr web interface ( since ， cookies are shared across ports ) . ， For vendor remark on # 5 see solution section. ， 6 ) Authentication Bypass - CVE-2016-1610 ， An unauthenticated attacker is able to upload email templates. ， 7 ) Path Traversal - CVE-2016-1610 ， The functionality that allows an administrator to upload email templates fails ， to restrict the directory the templates are uploaded to. Please note that ， combined with vulnerability # 6 an attacker is able to upload arbitray files with ， the permissions of the system user \"wwwrun\". ， 8 ) Insecure File Permissions - CVE-2016-1611 ， A file that is run upon system user login is world-writeable. This allows a local ， attacker with restricted privileges to inject commands that are being executed ， as privileged users as soon as they log into the system. Please note that ， combined with vulnerabilities # 6 and # 7 an unauthenticated attacker can inject ， commands that are executed as privileged system users ( e.g. root ) using the Filr ， web interface. ， Proof of concept :  ， 1 , 2 , 3 )  ， The following HTML fragment demonstrates that using a CSRF attack (  # 1 ) system ， commands can be injected (  # 2 ) that are executed as the user root (  # 3 )  :  ， ----- snip -----",
