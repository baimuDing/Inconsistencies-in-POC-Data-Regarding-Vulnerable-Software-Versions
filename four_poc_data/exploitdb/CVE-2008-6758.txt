Earlier versions may also be affected. ，  ! dork ， Dork : intext : \"Free Ecommerce Shopping Cart Software by ViArt\" +\"Your shopping cart is empty ! \" + \"Products Search\" +\"Advanced Search\" + \"All Categories\" ，  ! risk 1 - Full Path Disclosure ， Low ， Attackers can use this vulnerability to leverage another attack ， after the full path has been disclosed. ，  ! discussion 1 - Full Path Disclosure ， The server will give an error when any URL real/imaginary is ， passed to the POST_DATA parameter :  ， A remote user is able to identify the full path of the document ， root folder. ，  ! risk 2 - Information Disclosure ， Medium ， The table names can be further leveraged for a SQL injection if ， one exists. ，  ! discussion 2 - Information Disclosure ， When a user is not signed in , the tables are shown to the ， attacker via an error , because the PHP form fails to properly ， sanitize user_id since the user is not logged in. ， The attacker must first try to add a product to the cart and ， then save the shopping cart for the tables to be revealed by ， browsing to :  ，  ! risk 3 - Arbitrary Code Injection ， High ， Attackers can use this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code ， on a legitimate user. ，  ! discussion 3 - Arbitrary Code Injection ， The attacker is able to create shopping carts with ， HTML/Javascript injected code such as :  ， href=\" ， Then when the user visits \"My Saved Carts\" at ， the code is executed :  ， Example 1 would give a link to the Google search engine. ， Example 2 would give a javascript alert popup displaying \"VULN\". ， Example 3 would send the user to a malicious site. ， Note : manuals_search.php is also vulnerable to the same ， HTML/Javascript vulnerability that allows for arbitrary code to ， be executed :  ， A remote user is able to identify the full path of the document ， root folder. ，  ! extras ， The Cart name is all that needs to be guessed/brute-forced for ， an attacker to gain entry to the shopping cart.

Alert users that they ， should be wary of which links they click on as an attacker ， could redirect them to a malicious site. The overloading of ， cart_save.php can be solved by placing IP-bans on attackers. ， There is no solution to the brute-force guessing of cart names. ， The vendor has not yet been notified. ，  ! greetz ， Greetz go out to the people who know me. ，  ! author ， Xia Shing Zee ，  # milw0rm.com [ 2009-01-01 ] ",
