    "text": "ecve : CVE-2002-0158 ， title : Sun Solaris 2.6/7.0/8 - XSun Color Database File Heap Overflow - Solaris local Exploit ， verified : Verified ， exploit_detail : // source :  ， Solaris is the freely available Unix operating system distributed by Sun Microsystems. ， It may be possible for a local user to gain elevated privileges. When Xsun is executed , and an excessively long argument is supplied to the -co flag , a heap overflow occurs. This problem could allow a local user to supply a maliciously formatted string with the -co option that could result in the execution of arbitrary code , and elevated privileges. ， / * Xsun ( sparc ) local exploit ， by gloomy ( gloomy @ root66.org ) & eSDee ( esdee @ netric.org )  ， Xsun is a Solaris server for X version 11. This program contains ， an option that is not really secure nowadays :  ) . ， The option is used to determine the color database file. And yeah ,  ， indeed , you guessed it already , it contains a heap overflow. ， When we were busy writing this exploit within a multi display ， screen , we discovered some weird \"unable-to-write-over-stackframe\" ， problems. We tried everything to just write a few bytes over a ， saved program counter , but unfortunatly it was not possible on the ， current machine we were using. Then eSDee came up with something ， news. In the middle of the night a loud \"yippeaaaaaa ! \" came out ， the bedroom of mister Es. He discovered a little section just ， below the GOT. It didn't contain \\0 bytes and it was writeable. ， It's called the ti_jmp_table. I'm sure eSDee will write some ， papers about it soon. ， Gloomy was busy writing a shellcode that re-opens the STDIN. He ， found out that he just could open /dev/tty and then duplicate the ， STDERR filedescriptor , so the important descriptors were back ， again. ， USAGE :  ， ./Xsun-expl [ retloc ]  [ ret ]  ， Example :  ， bash $ gcc -o Xsun-expl Xsun-expl.c -Wall -Werror ， bash $ ./Xsun-expl ， Couldn't open RGB_DB 'AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA..... ， bash $ id ， uid=500 ( user ) gid=0 ( root )  ， Greets and kisses :  ，  # netric - www.netric.org ，  # root66 - www.root66.org ， mostlyharmless - www.mostly-harmless.nl [ soon ]  ， dB_____ - fijne broer van gloom-ei !  :  )  ， squezel - lekker ventje ben jij. ， More information available at :  ， 09 ，  [ ps. wat een lompe text ]  ，  * /",
