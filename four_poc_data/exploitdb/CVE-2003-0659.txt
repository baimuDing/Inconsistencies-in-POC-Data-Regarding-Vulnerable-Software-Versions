This function is used by applications implementing the use of ListBox or ComboBox controls and will be triggered when the program encounters specific types of Windows messages.\r ， This issue poses a security risk when a privileged application is running in the environment of an unprivileged user. Due to the ability for a program to transmit a windows message to another process, an attacker may be capable of exploiting this buffer overrun to gain privileged access to a system.\r ， // vuln.cpp : Defines the entry point for the application."
