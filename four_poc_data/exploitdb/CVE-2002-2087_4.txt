It is available for Unix and Linux operating systems. ， A buffer overflow has been discovered in the gds_drop program packaged with Interbase. This problem could allow a local user to execute the program with strings of arbitrary length. By using a custom crafted string , the attacker could overwrite stack memory , including the return address of a function , and potentially execute arbitrary code. ， Firebird is based on Borland/Inprise Interbase source code and is therefore also prone to this issue. ， / * DSR-firebird.c by bob @ dtors.net",
