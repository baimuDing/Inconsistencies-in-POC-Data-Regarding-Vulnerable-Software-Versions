If the BranchOffset is -305 or ， smaller it will cause an Access Violation when reading data from a ， invalid memory address. The last 16-bits of the address are controlable ， with the size of the BranchOffset argument. Any data which is in a valid ， segment of memory near the controlled address can be read causing Memory ， Disclosure. This would be used well in combination with a memory corruption ， vulnerability in order to bypass ASLR. ， In doing my initial research I found a lot of interesting things along the way. ， Flash10c is not vulnerable in the same way Flash10e is. I initially discovered ， the integer overflow in Flash10c while fuzzing SWF. I didnt fuzz it via a web ， browser but instead used a free application which uses the modules in a more ， direct manner. Flash10c is not able to be attacked via a browser as far as I ， have been able to tell. However , I have found during my research that Flash10e ， is loaded as a module when any Flash object is encountered. I am unsure as to ， this issue I found that both versions have a self-changing CRC which inhibits ， keeping break points set. ， Another interesting note is that when confirming the",
