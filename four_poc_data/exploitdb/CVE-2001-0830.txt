It works by creating IPv6 tunnels. ， A problem has been discovered in the software package that could allow remote users to deny service to legitimate users of the service. The problem is due to the management of sockets by the software package. When a client disconnects from the 6tunnel server , the socket previously used by the client enters the CLOSE state and does not time out. Once a large number of sockets is reached , the service crashes. ， This makes it possible for a malicious user to deny service to legitimate users of the service. ， / *  ，  * ipv4/ipv6 tcp connection flooder. ，  * Originally used as a DoS for 6tunnel ( versions < 0.08 ) . ，  * Version 0.08 is a broken version.
