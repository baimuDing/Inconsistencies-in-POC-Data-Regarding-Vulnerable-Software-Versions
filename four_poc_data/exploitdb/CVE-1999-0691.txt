It is distributed with various commercial UNIX implementations. ， Under some distributions of CDE Common Desktop Environment , the dtaction program has a locally exploitable buffer overflow condition. The buffer overflow condition exists in the argument parsing code for the -u ( user ) function. Any information provided by the user over 1024 bytes may overwrite the buffer and in return be exploited by a malicious user. ， Since the dtaction program is typically installed setuid root , this make it possible for a local user to gain administrative access on a vulnerable system. ，  * / ， / *  ，  * dtaction_ov.c ，  * Job de Haas ，  *  ( c ) ITSX bv 1999 ，  * This program demonstrates an overflow problem in /usr/dt/bin/dtaction. ，  * It has only been tested on Solaris 7 x86 ，  * assembly code has been taken from ex_dt",
