In the actionIndex (  ) function located in \"/protected/modules_core/notification/controllers/ListController.php\" [ 3 ] a check is performed on the unsanitized $ lastEntryId variable ( which is fetched from the 'from' GET parameter ) to see if it is greater than 0. However , since PHP uses type-unstrict comparisons and $ lastEntryId isn't guaranteed to be an integer , this allows an attacker to prefix their string of choice with any number of integers ( so that $ lastEntryId gets treated as an integer during the comparison ) such that the comparison evaluates to true and $ criteria->condition is injected with the otherwise unsanitized $ lastEntryId , which can be any SQL injection.",
