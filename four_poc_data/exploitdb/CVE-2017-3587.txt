The heap memory corruption takes place in the VirtualBox.exe process running on a Windows host ( other host platforms were untested ) . It can be triggered from an unprivileged ring-3 process running in a Windows guest , by performing two nt ! NtQueryDirectoryFile system calls [ 1 ] against a shared ( sub ) directory one after another : the first one with the ReturnSingleEntry argument set to FALSE , and the next one with ReturnSingleEntry=TRUE. During the second system call , a double free takes place and the VM execution is aborted. ， We have confirmed that the vulnerability reproduces with Windows 7/10 32-bit as the guest , and Windows 7 64-bit as the host system , but havent checked other configurations. However , it seems very likely that the specific version of Windows as the guest/host is irrelevant. ， It also seems important for reproduction that the shared directory being queried has some files ( preferably a few dozen ) inside of it.
