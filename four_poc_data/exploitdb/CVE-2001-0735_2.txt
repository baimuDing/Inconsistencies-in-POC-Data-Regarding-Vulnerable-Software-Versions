Due to insufficient validation of input , a user can execute arbitrary code through the .nofinger file. ， This makes it possible for a local user to gain elevated privileges , and potentially root access. ， states :  ， Cfingerd is a free and secure finger daemon replacement for ， standard finger daemons such as GNU fingerd or MIT fingerd. ， April 11 , 2001 Megyer Laszlo < abulla @ freemail.hu > wrote :  ， In 3 words : REMOTE ROOT VULNERABILITY ， idcf.c - July 11 2001 - happy 3 month anniversary !  ， cfingerd 1.4.3 identd based localish exploit ;  ]  ， no shellcode required if you have a local account ， make a script in ~ /.nofinger that you want to be ， executed as root. ， it works by diverting the fopen call to popen. of ， course it won't help if you don't already have a ， local account but well , its just a proof of concept ， and I think it's cute , and the more exploits there ， are against an unpatched system , the more likely ( I ， hope ) it will get patched.
