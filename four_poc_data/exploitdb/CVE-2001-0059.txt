A problem exists which could allow a user to corrupt or append system files. ， The problem exists in the creation of /tmp files by patchadd. patchadd creates a variety of files in /tmp while installing the patches on the operating system. The files created in /tmp are mode 0666 , and are created with the extension sh<pid of patchadd>.1 , sh<pid of patchadd>.2 , and so on. Running the program requires administrative access. It is possible to brute force guess the pid of patchadd , and create files in the /tmp directory that are symbolic links to sensitive system files. ， It is therefore possible for a user with malicious intent to gain elevated privileges , corrupt system files , or execute arbitrary commands. ，  #  ! /usr/local/bin/perl ，  # Exploit for patchadd Solaris 2.x.
