    "text": "ecve : CVE-2001-0034 ， title : KTH Kerberos 4 - Arbitrary Proxy Usage - Multiple remote Exploit ， verified : Verified ， exploit_detail : source :  ， Kerberos is a widely used network service authentication system. The version of Kerberos developed and maintained by KTH ( Swedish Royal Institute of Technology ) contains a vulnerability that may allow/assist in a local or remote root compromise. ， KTH Kerberos uses an environment variable called 'krb4_proxy' when a proxy server is required to retrieve tickets via HTTP. KTH Kerberos-supported services will contact the supplied proxy server ( the value of krb4_proxy ) instead of the default Kerberos server if this variable is set. ， It is possible for malicious remote users ( before authenticating ) to remotely set the value of this variable and have the server program contact a fake Kerberos server. This would allow the attacker to intercept authentication requests and/or send false replies to the service they are attempting to use. An attacker , for example , could send the environment variable via telnet to a Kerberos supporting telnet daemon. ， This attack allows malicious users in control of a fake Kerberos server to exploit a buffer overflow vulnerability ( See Bugtraq ID 2091 ) in the Kerberos shared libraries with malformed replies. If exploited , the combined vulnerabilities may provide remote root access to attackers. ， telnet> environ define krb4_proxy ， telnet> environ export krb4_proxy ， telnet> open localhost",
