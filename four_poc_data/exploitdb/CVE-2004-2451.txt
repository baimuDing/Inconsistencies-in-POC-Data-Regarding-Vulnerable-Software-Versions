Rather the attacker will require knowledge of user ID's connected to a target channel. Because the user ID's for a channel exist in a range of 0-127 , the attacker may transmit an audio stream to an affected server that will be heard by all connected users , however the server administrator will have no control over disconnecting or muting this audio stream.",
