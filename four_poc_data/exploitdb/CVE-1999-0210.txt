    "text": "ecve : CVE-1999-0210 ， title : Solaris 2.5.1 - 'automount' Local Privilege Escalation - Solaris local Exploit ， verified : Verified ， exploit_detail : / *  ， source :  ， The automounter daemon ( automountd ) answers file system mount and unmount requests from the autofs filesystem via RPC. A vulnerability has been discovered that may allow an unauthorized user to send arbitrary commands to the automounter daemons. These commands given automounter's SUID root status are executed as root. ， This bug was origanally thought to be fixed by a Sun patch , however subsequent findings by a bugtraq poster discovered that the patch was insufficient. Moreover , it was initially thought that this bug was local only. Multiple parties later discovered the problem could be exploited remotely by leveraging the attack off a remote vulnerability in rpc.statd. In particular Solaris rpc.statd allows remote users to proxy RPC requests through itself so they appear to have come from the localhost. ，  * / ， / *  ， this is really dumb automountd exploit , tested on solaris 2.5.1 ， ./r blahblah /bin/chmod \"777 /etc ; 2nd cmd ; 3rd cmd\" and so on ,  ， map is executed via popen with key given as argument , read automount ( 1M )  ， patch 10465 [ 45 ] fixes this ，  * /",
