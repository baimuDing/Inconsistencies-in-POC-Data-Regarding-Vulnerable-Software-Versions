    "text": "ecve : CVE-2002-0982 ， title : Microsoft SQL Server 2000 - sp_MScopyscript SQL Injection - Windows remote Exploit ， verified : Verified ， exploit_detail : source :  ， The Microsoft SQL Server 2000 sp_MScopyscript stored procedure does not sufficiently validate input before passing it to the xp_cmdshell extended stored procedure. An attacker with the ability to execute a query or pass malicious input to a query may be able to execute operating system commands via xp_cmdshell with the privileges of the SQL Server. ， The sp_MScopyscript stored procedure may be executed by the 'public' role by default , so it is possible that a database user with privileges may potentially exploit this issue. ， The Microsoft SQL Server must be configured to function as a distributor for this issue to be exploited. Certain other conditions must be satisfied for exploitation to succeed , such as the SQL Server running in the context of a domain user. ， By supplying a malformed @ scriptfile parameter an attacker can run arbitrary ， commands :  ， use master ， declare @ cmd nvarchar ( 4000 )  ， exec sp_MScopyscriptfile N'c : \\autoexec.bat\" c : \\cp.txt&",
