An attacker may authenticate as another database user if they can successfully guess the first character of the correct password for that user. The range of the valid character set for passwords is 32 characters , which means that a malicious user can authenticate after a maximum of 32 attempts if they cycle through all of the valid characters. ，  * / ，  * hoagie_mysql.c ，  * local and remote exploit for mysql <= 3.23.53a ，  * new years present .... works also for 3.23.54 openbsd ，  *  ( head ) date 16/12/2002 ，  * hey after some code checking and patching my mysql server ，  * i relized , that this patch doesnt protect you against ，  * this vulnerability. ，  * The length of the scramble string is important for the ，  * password check and not the length of the password. ，  * perhaps other system are also still vulnerable ，  * gcc hoagie_mysql.c -o hoagie_mysql -lmysqlclient -I/usr/local/include -L/usr/local/lib/mysql ，  * Author : Andi <andi @ void.at>",
