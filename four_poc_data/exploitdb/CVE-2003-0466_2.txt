A vulnerability that was reported to affect the implementation of 'realpath (  ) ' in WU-FTPD has lead to the discovery that at least one implementation of the C library is also vulnerable. FreeBSD has announced that the off-by-one stack- buffer-overflow vulnerability is present in their libc. Other systems are also likely vulnerable. ， Reportedly , this vulnerability has been successfully exploited against WU-FTPD to execute arbitrary instructions. ， NOTE : Patching the C library alone may not remove all instances of this vulnerability. Statically linked programs may need to be rebuilt with a patched version of the C library. Also , some applications may implement their own version of 'realpath (  ) '. These applications would require their own patches. FreeBSD has published a large list of applications that use 'realpath (  ) '. Administrators of FreeBSD and other systems are urged to review it. For more information , see the advisory 'FreeBSD-SA-03 : 08.realpath'. ， / *  ， wu-ftpd v2.6.2 off-by-one remote 0day exploit. ， exploit by \"you dong-hun\" ( Xpl017Elz )  , <szoahc @ hotmail.com>. ， Update :  ，  [ v0.0.2 ] August 2 , I added wu-ftpd-2.6.2 , 2.6.0 , 2.6.1 finally. ，  [ v0.0.3 ] August 3 , Brute-Force function addition. ，  [ v0.0.4 ] August 4 , Added FreeBSD , OpenBSD version wu-ftpd-2.6.x exploit. ， It will be applied well to most XxxxBSD. ，  [ v0.0.5 ] August 4 , Remote scan & exploit test function addition. ， August 6 , Cleaning. ，  * /",
