VULNERABILITY ， GNU Wget < 1.18 Arbitrary File Upload / Potential Remote Code Execution ， II. BACKGROUND ， \"GNU Wget is a free software package for retrieving files using HTTP , HTTPS and ， FTP , the most widely-used Internet protocols. ， It is a non-interactive commandline tool , so it may easily be called from ， scripts , cron jobs , terminals without X-Windows support , etc. ， GNU Wget has many features to make retrieving large files or mirroring entire ， web or FTP sites easy ， III.

DESCRIPTION ， Because of lack of sufficient controls in wget , when user downloads a file ， with wget , such as :  ， wget ， an attacker who controls the server could make wget create an arbitrary file ， with an arbitrary contents and filename by issuing a crafted HTTP 30X Redirect ， containing FTP server reference in response to the victim's wget request. ， For example , if the attacker's server replies with the following response :  ， HTTP/1.1 302 Found ， Cache-Control : private ， Content-Type : ",
