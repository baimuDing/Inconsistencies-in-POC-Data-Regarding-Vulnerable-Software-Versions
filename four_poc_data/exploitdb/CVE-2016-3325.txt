The size of the read can be controlled through the HTTP response. An attacker that is able to get any application that uses WININET to make a request to a server under his/her control may be able to disclose information stored after this memory block. This includes Microsoft Internet Explorer, Microsoft Edge and Microsoft Windows Media Player. As far as I can tell WININET is widely used by Microsoft applications to handle HTTP requests, and probably be all third-party applications that use Windows APIs to make HTTP requests. All these applications may be vulnerable to the issue, though it may be hard to exploit in most (if not all, see below).\r ， Known affected versions, attack vectors and mitigations\r ， WININET.dll\r ， The issue was first discovered in pre-release Windows 10 fbl_release.140912-1613, which contained WININET.DLL version 11.00.9841.0. This vulnerability appears to have been present in all versions of Windows 10 since, up until the issue was addressed in August 2016. No mitigations against the issue are known.\r ， Microsoft Internet Explorer\r ， XMLHttpRequest can be used to trigger this issue - I have not tried other vectors. To exploit the vulnerability, Javascript is most likely required, so disabling Javascript should mitigate it.\r ， Microsoft Edge\r ， XMLHttpRequest can be used to trigger this issue - I have not tried other vectors. To exploit the vulnerability, Javascript is most likely required, so disabling Javascript should mitigate it.\r ， Microsoft Windows Media Player\r ， Opening a link to a media file on a malicious server can be used to trigger the issue.\r ， Microsoft has released two bulletins to address this issue, one for Microsoft Internet Explorer and one for Microsoft Edge. I do not know why Microsoft did not mention other applications in their bulletins, nor why they have two fixes for these specific applications, rather than one fix for a component of the Windows Operating System.\r ， One wonders what would happen on a system where you have previously uninstalled both MSIE and Edge: do neither of the fixes apply and will your system be left vulnerable? Let me know if you found out!\r ， Repro\r ， The below repro consists of two parts: an HTML file that constructs an XMLHttpRequest in order to trigger the issue and a raw HTTP response that actually triggers it.\r ， -->\r ， <!DOCTYPE html>"
