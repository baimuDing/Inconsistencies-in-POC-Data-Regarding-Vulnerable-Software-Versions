The <string> element used to define a filename was found to be # vulnerable to a buffer overflow , which can be exploited to execute arbitrary code under the context of the # user running StoryBoard Quick 6. Supplying a long file name causes memory corruption within the application. ，  # By crafting a file that contains more than 507 characters in the <string> field , the StoryBoard Quick 6 # application will use the next 4 characters in an unsafe manner. These four characters are used as a pointer # to the source address for a string copy function. It is possible to write user-supplied data onto the stack # by changing the value of these 4 characters to a memory location containing a pointer to data within the # Frame.xml file. This strcpy function overwrites a significant portion of the stack , including the Structured # Exception Handler.",
