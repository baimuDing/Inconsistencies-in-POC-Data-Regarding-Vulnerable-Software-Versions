This vulnerability is a buffer overflow triggered by unusually long path names ( directory structures ) . For example , if a user has write privilages he or she may create an unusually long pathname which due to insuficient bounds checking in ProFTPD will overwrite the stack. This will allow the attacker to insert their own instruction set on the stack to be excuted thereby elavating their access. ， The problem is in a bad implementation of the \"realpath\" function. ，  * / ， / *  ，  * Remote/local exploit for wu-ftpd [ 12 ] through [ 18 ]  ，  * gcc w00f.c -o w00f -Wall -O2 ，  * Offsets/padding may need to be changed , depending on remote daemon ，  * compilation options. Try offsets -5000 to 5000 in increments of 100. ，  * Note : you need to use -t >0 for -any- version lower than 18. ，  * Coded by smiler and cossack ，  * /",
