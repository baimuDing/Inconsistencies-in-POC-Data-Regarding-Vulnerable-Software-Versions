    "text": "ecve : CVE-1999-0725 ， title : Microsoft IIS 3.0/4.0 - Double Byte Code Page - Windows remote Exploit ， verified : Verified ， exploit_detail : source :  ， This vulnerability could allow a web site viewer to obtain the source code for .asp and similar files if the server's default language ( Input Locale ) is set to Chinese , Japanese or Korean. How this works is as follows :  ， IIS checks the extension of the requested file to see if it needs to do any processing before delivering the information. If the requested extension is not on it's list , it then makes any language-based calculations , and delivers the file. If a single byte is appended to the end of the URL when IIS to set to use one of the double-byte language packs ( Chinese , Japanese , or Korean ) the language module will strip it as invalid , then look for the file. Since the new URL now points to a valid filename , and IIS has already determined that this transaction requires no processing , the file is simply delivered as is , exposing the source code. ， Request a URL of a known-good file that requires server processing , then append a hex value between x81 and xfe to the URL. For example : < If your server is vulnerable you will receive back the source code of your .asp file.",
