    "text": "ecve : CVE-1999-0980 ， title : Microsoft Windows NT 4.0/SP1/SP2/SP3/SP4/SP5/SP6 - 'Services.exe' Denial of Service ( 2 ) - Windows dos Exploit ， verified : Verified ， exploit_detail : source :  ， A specially crafted packet can cause a denial of service on an NT 4.0 host , rendering local administration and network communication nearly unusable. This attack will crash the \"services\" executable , which in turn , disables the ability for the machine to perform actions via named pipes. As a consequence , users will be unable to remotely logon , logoff , manage the registry , create new file share connections , or perform remote administration. Services such as Internet Information Server may also fail to operate as expected. Rebooting the affected machine will resolve the issue , provided it is not attacked again. ， The problem lies within the manner that srvsvc.dll makes calls to services.exe. Certain MSRPC calls will return NULL values which are not correctly interpreted by services.exe. This , in turn , may lead to a crash of Services.exe. ， If this denial of service is combined with a number of other exploits , it may be possible to have this attack spawn a Debugger ( ie Dr Watson ) call on the host , which , if trojaned , may execute malicious code on the target host.",
