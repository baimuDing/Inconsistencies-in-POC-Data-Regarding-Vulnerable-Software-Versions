    "text": "ecve : CVE-2019-0574 ， title : Microsoft Windows 10 - DSSVC MoveFileInheritSecurity Privilege Escalation - Windows local Exploit ， verified : Verified ， exploit_detail : Windows : DSSVC MoveFileInheritSecurity Multiple Issues EoP ， Platform : Windows 10 1803 and 1809. ， Class : Elevation of Privilege ， Security Boundary ( per Windows Security Service Criteria )  : User boundary ， NOTE : This is one of multiple issues Im reporting in the same service. While Ive tried to ensure all the bugs are effectively orthogonal from each other its possible that fixes for one thing might affect others. Ive also not reported every possible problem with the service as at some point I had to stop. Ive not determined if any of these issues could be abusable from a sandbox , most of the issues almost certainly cant be due to the requirements for arbitrary file symlinks but its not impossible. ， Summary :  ， The Data Sharing Service MoveFileInheritSecurity method is broken leading to EoP. ， Description :  ， The PolicyChecker :  : MoveFileInheritSecurity method is almost an exact copy of the code from the Storage Service which I exploited in MSRC cases 42121 and 42122. In fact Id say its the same code copy and pasted. It has the exactly same bugs as the storage service version , specifically arbitrary file writes , due to the reverting call to MoveFileEx and arbitrary ACL setting by placing a hardlinked file in a directory with inheritable ACEs. ， This method is called from DSSMoveToSharedFile and DSSMoveFromSharedFile. While those methods do some checking its still possible to bypass the checks. This results in the MoveFileInheritSecurity method being called as the SYSTEM user which results in EoP. ， Im saddened by the fact this wasnt discovered during variant analysis from the Storage Service issues.",
