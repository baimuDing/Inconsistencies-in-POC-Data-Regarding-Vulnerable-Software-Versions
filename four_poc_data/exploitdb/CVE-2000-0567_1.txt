This process is handled by INETCOMM.DLL. Improper bounds checking exists on the token represented by GMT. Therefore , if a malicious user was to send a specially crafted email message containing an unusually long value in the GMT specification , the buffer would be overflowed making arbitrary code execution possible. Sending random data could cause the application to crash. ， Eg :  ， Date : Tue , 18 July 2000 14 : 16 : 06 +1000<long string of characters> ， This can also be achieved by encoding the specially formed GMT field as a MIME attachment in Outlook's MIME attached message format. ， This lends itself to the possibility of a myriad of exploits , such as the execution of trojan horses , the spread of worms , gaining user level access on the target host , etc. automatically without the email recipient's consent to open an attachment or run an executable. ， A user would only have to download an offending email in order to become susceptible to an attack. ，  #  ! /usr/bin/perl ，  # Ussr Labs ( Exploiteable Buffer Overflow )  ，  # Outlook Express 5.0 | Outlook 2000 | Outlook 97.0 | Outlook 98 ，  # By : Ussr Labs ，  # Arbitary shellcode injector over SMTP ，  # ./ $ 0 -h <server hostname> -m <mail> ，  # ./dieoutlook.pl -h <smtp server> -m victim @ address.com ，  # For Multiple email's Spanwn do something like this :  ，  # for i in `",
