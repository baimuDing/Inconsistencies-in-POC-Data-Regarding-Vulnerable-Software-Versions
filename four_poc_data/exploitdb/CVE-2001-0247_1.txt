This is because that is usually how much data is read from a socket. Because of this assumption , certain memory copy operations involving user data lack bounds checking. ， It is possible for users to use metacharacters to expand file/path names through interpretation by glob (  ) and exploit these overflowable conditions. In order to do so , the attacker's ftp account must be able to either create directories or directories with long enough names must exist already. ， Any attacker to successfully exploit this vulnerability would gain root access on the target host. ， / *  ，  * turkey2.c - \"gobble gobble\" ，  * REMOTE ROOT EXPLOIT FOR BSD FTPD ，  * by : fish stiqz <fish @ analog.org> 04/14/2001 ，  * shouts : trey , dono , hampton and The Analog Organization. ，  * Notes :  ，  * Doesn't break chroot so requires an account. ，  * Fixed a design issue I had previously overlooked. ，  * Added support for OpenBSD 2.8 = ) . ，  * /",
