Versions prior to 0.42 incorrectly dropped privileges on all Unix variants except HPUX. By calling a seteuid ( getuid (  )  ) call , the authors hoped to drop permissions to prevent the obtaining of root privilege should there be potential vulnerabilities in mtr or a library it depends on. However , due to saved uid semantics , the uid of 0 can be recovered simply by doing a setuid ( 0 ) . An attacker would only need to find an overflow in one of the libraries mtr uses , such as gtk or curses. In patched versions , the seteuid (  ) call has been changed to setuid (  ) . This will eliminate this potential problem. ， / *  ( c ) 2000 babcia padlina / buffer0verfl0w security ( www.b0f.com )  * / ， / * freebsd mtr-0.41 local root exploit * /",
