    "text": "ecve : CVE-2001-0925 ， title : Apache 1.3 - Artificially Long Slash Path Directory Listing ( 2 ) - Multiple remote Exploit ， verified : Verified ， exploit_detail : // source :  ， Apache HTTPD is the Apache Web Server , freely distributed and actively maintained by the Apache Software Foundation. It is a freely available and widely used software package , included with various implementations of the UNIX operating system and can be used on Microsoft Windows operating systems. ， A problem in the package could allow directory indexing and path discovery. In a default configuration , Apache enables mod_dir , mod_autoindex , and mod_negotiation. However , by sending the Apache server a custom-crafted request consisting of a long path name created artificially by using numerous slashes , an attacker can cause these modules to misbehave , allowing the attacker to escape the error page and to gain a listing of the directory contents. ， This vulnerability allows a malicious remote user to launch an information-gathering attack , which could potentially result in a compromise of the system. Additionally , this vulnerability affects all releases of Apache previous to 1.3.19. ， / *  ， Program : apacheslash.c ， Original Date : 2-21-02 ， Version : 1.0 ， Platform : Linux ( compiled on SuSE 7.3 )  ， c0der : st0ic ， site : www.fsix.net ， e-mail : st0ic @ blackcodemail.com ， Revised :  ， NONE thus far ， Description : This program tests an Apache installation for the \"Apache Artificially Long Slash Path ， Directory Listing Exploit.\" See SecurityFocus.com BID 2503 - ， Compile : gcc apacheslash.c -o apacheslash ， Stuff : I know theres already 3 Perl scripts that test this bug out , but there execution time is horrible ， so I was bored and decided to recode it in C for execution speed sake. On my box , I think it took ， about 8 mins to send 1000 /'s to apache with apache2.pl. It takes about 2 seconds with this program. ， BTW , SuSE 7.3 comes with Apache 1.3.20 , which is NOT vulnerable : - ) . Check out the securityfocus.com ， BID 2503 to find out whats vulnerable and whats not. ， I also included the comments from apache2.pl exploit which was modified ， by Siberian of sentry-labs.com. Read below for the details :  ，  #  ! /usr/bin/perl ，  # orginal by farm9 , Inc. ( copyright 2001 )  ，  # new modified code by Siberian ( www.sentry-labs.com )  ，  # Note : This isn't the orginal exploit ! This one was modified and partly rewritten. ，  # Changes :  ，  # - help added ( more user firendly : - )  )  ，  # - messages added ，  # - exploit is now able to be executed on WinNT or 2k. ，  # - uses perl version of BSD sockets ( compatible to Windows )  ，  # Rewriter's Note : I rewrote ( I was bored to death that evening : - )  ) some ，  # of the code and made it esaier to use and cross platform compatible. ，  # The old verion used a esaier but not that compaible way of socket stream communication. ，  # Any network code was replaced by cross platform compatible BSD sockets. ，  #  ( much better than any other stream method : - )  )  ，  # Tested with Perl 5.6 ( Linux ) and ActivePerl 5.6 ( Win32 )  ，  # Original comment and source is attached below. ，  # Name : Apache Artificially Long Slash Path Directory Listing Exploit ，  # Author : Matt Watchinski ，  # Ref : SecurityFocus BID 2503 ，  # Affects : Apache 1.3.17 and below",
