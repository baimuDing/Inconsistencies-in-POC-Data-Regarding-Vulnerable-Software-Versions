POINT ! POINT ! POINT ! POINT ! =-=- ， This vulnerability is one of the normal exploitation case under exec-shield. ， GNU imap4d can be run as a standalone deamon by using -d option and it inherits ， virtual address of parent process which mapped randomly. ，  [ root @ localhost .libs ]  # ps -ef | grep imap4d | grep -v grep ， root 8312 1 0 20 : 01 ? 00 : 00 : 00 ./lt-imap4d -d ，  [ root @ localhost .libs ]  #  ， These are keys to get over some possible problems. ，  * `One shot' exploit without brute-forcing. ， Sometimes you man need to do some brute-forcing to assume the library address ， which is mapped randomly. But this is not my recommendation. ， Because it is a format string attack , we can possibly get the ramdom address ， of the library. Using this technique , I could find exploitable do_system (  )  ， address at once. but , unfortunately , it is not applicable to blind format string ， exploit by syslog (  ) . ，  * How to execute a remote shell. ， I decided to use xterm for this , but if sadly , there is no xterm on the target ， server then you should look for another way. because of the variableness ， of size of IP address , I felt a need for fitting the address within 10 bytes. ， Hacker's IP address would be a perfect demical numbers and it makes size ， of IP address same and shortens the string to overwrite. ， xterm exploit code includes do_system (  ) address can be writen in 136 bytes ， of general exploit code. ，  * /",
