Under some configurations where this is enabled a remote user can pass a filename beginning with a minus sign to FTP , which will pass this as an argument to the compression/archiver program ( where it will be erroneously treated as a command line argument other than a filename ) . It may be possible to exploit this and execute commands on a remote machine. An example of this exploits the \"-use-compress-program PROG\" parameter passed to tar ; if PROG refers to a program that is accessible to the FTP server , it will be executed. The remote user must have access to a writeable directory in order to exploit this. See exploit for details. ， With a valid FTP account only the server , the difficulty goes right down. You also have the added ， benefit of not being stuck in a chroot (  ) environment at the end. Local exploit time. ， The exploit goes along much the same lines as the anonymous FTP exploit does :  ， Create a backdoor , using bindshell from our previous example :  ，  $ gcc bindshell.c -o b -static ， If you can perform a SITE CHMOD ( default for normal non-anon users on wu-ftpd )  , then you can ， use the following script example. Create a script to exec the desired commands : ",
