    "text": "ecve : CVE-2003-0132 ， title : Apache 2.x - Memory Leak - Windows dos Exploit ， verified : Verified ， exploit_detail : / * apache-massacre.c ，  * Test code for Apache 2.x Memory Leak ，  * By Matthew Murphy ，  * DISCLAIMER : This exploit tool is provided only to test networks for a ，  * known vulnerability. Do not use this tool on systems you do not control ,  ，  * and do not use this tool on networks you do not own without appropriate ，  * consent from the network owner. You are responsible for any damage your ，  * use of the tool causes. In no event may the author of this tool be held ，  * responsible for damages relating to its use. ，  * As with most Apache exposures , the impacts vary between ports of the server :  ，  * Non-Unix ( Win32 , Netware , OS/2 )  : These ports are most adversely affected ，  * by this , as Apache's child process doesn't terminate normally unless the ，  * parent process stops. This means that leaks ( and any performance loss ) hang ，  * around until Apache is restarted. ，  * Unix/mpm_prefork : This MPM offers the most protection against successful ，  * exploitation , as its processes exit at the end of the request. ，  * Unix/other MPMs : These other MPMs utilize multiple Apache processes for ，  * multiple Apache requests. Depending on the MPM in use and the traffic rates ，  * of the server , this may be used to the advantage of a potential attacker. ，  * If multiple different Apache processes are utilized , an attacker can spread ，  * the substantial leak between processes to dodge resource limits imposed on ，  * httpd's UID ( usually nobody , www , or apache )  ，  * Credit : iDEFENSE reported this issue to several security lists on April 8 ,  ，  * 2003 following the Apache release announcement. Apache fixed the flaw about ，  * a month after the initial disclosure of this vulnerability. iDEFENSE credits ，  * the discovery of this vulnerability to an anonymous researcher. ，  * Happy Hunting !  ，  * / ，  # ifn",
