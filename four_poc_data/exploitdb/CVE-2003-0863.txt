    "text": "ecve : CVE-2003-0863 ， title : PHP 4.3.x - Undefined Safe_Mode_Include_Dir Safemode Bypass - PHP local Exploit ， verified : Verified ， exploit_detail : source :  ， PHP is prone to an issue that may allow programs to bypass Safe Mode by calling external files in restricted directories using include (  ) and require (  ) . ， The problem is known to occur when the safe_mode_include_dir PHP directive is not defined. A logic error reportedly exists which could result in PHP failing to run a security check when attempting to access a file via an include (  ) or require (  ) call , potentially bypassing the Safe Mode model. This could allow unauthorized access or policy bypass in environments that use Safe Mode , such as in cases where a web server resource is shared by multiple users. ， This issue is reported to exist in PHP versions 4.3.0 and later. ， <? ， echo ( \"trying to read /etc/passwd\" )  ;  ， include ( \"/etc/passwd\" )  ;  ， ?>",
