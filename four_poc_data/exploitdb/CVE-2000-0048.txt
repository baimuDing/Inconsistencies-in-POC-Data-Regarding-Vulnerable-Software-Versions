    "text": "ecve : CVE-2000-0048 ， title : Corel Linux OS 1.0 - get_it PATH - Linux local Exploit ， verified : Verified ， exploit_detail : source :  ， A component of the \"Corel Update\" utility distributed with Corel's Linux OS is vulnerable to a local PATH vulnerability. The binary \"get_it\" , which is stored in /usr/X11R6/bin , is setuid root installed by default on all Corel LinuxOS systems ( it's part of their .deb package install/update utils ) . get_it relies on PATH to be valid when it calls 'cp' ( without the full path )  , making it possible to spawn an arbitrary program ( called 'cp' ) with inherited root privs by changing the first searched path to one in which a malicious cp lies. The consequences are immediate local root compromise. ， CorelLinux :  ~  $ id ， uid=1001 ( tascon ) gid=1001 ( tascon ) groups=1001 ( tascon )  ， CorelLinux :  ~  $ ",
