    "text": "ecve : CVE-2006-3439 ， title : Microsoft Windows Server 2003 - NetpIsRemote (  ) Remote Overflow ( MS06-040 )  ( Metasploit ) - Windows remote Exploit ， verified : Verified ， exploit_detail :  ，  # netapi_win2003.pm ( MS06-040 Exploit for Windows Server 2003 SP0 )  ，  # Author : Trirat Puttaraksa ( Kira ) <trir00t [ at ] gmail.com> ，  # For educational purpose only ，  # Note : This exploit is developed because of my question \"Is it exploitable ，  # on Windows Server 2003 platform ?\". As I know , Windows XP SP2 and Windows ，  # Server 2003 SP1 is not exploitable because they are compiled with /GS , but ，  # how about Windows Server 2003 SP0 ? In metasploit netapi_ms06_040.pm there ，  # is no Windows Server 2003 sp0 target , this means 2003 SP0 is not ，  # exploitable ? There is Stack Protection Windows Server 2003 , is this the ，  # reasons why there is no Windows Server 2003 SP0 exploit for MS06-040 ? ，  # I start to modify H D Moore's exploit ( netapi_ms06_040.pm - credits to him ，  # ^-^ ) and work on it. The problem is the Stack Protection \"security cookie ，  # checking\". Because wcscpy (  ) method allow me to write to any memory location ，  # that are marked writable , I decide to write to the location at \"security ，  # cookie\" is stored and it works !  !  ! I will describe more implementation details ，  # in my blog in few days ^-^ ，  # This exploit tested on Windows Server 2003 SP0 build 3790 and successful ，  # exploit 2003 machine in my environment - all patch before MS06-040 ，  #  ( KB921883 ) . It's quite reliable but not 100%. There is the possibility that ，  # the exploit will fail and the target system process crash. Because I have ，  # only one testbase system , I couldn't confirm this exploit will work on ，  # your environment. However feel free to e-mail to me.",
