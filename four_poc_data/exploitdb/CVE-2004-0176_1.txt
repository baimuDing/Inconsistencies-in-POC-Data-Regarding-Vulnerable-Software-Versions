In this technique one part of the shellcode ，  * is kept before the buffer which overwrites the saved EIP on stack followed by a jmp OFFSET instruction which ，  * jumps EIP to the second half of the shellcode which is kept after return address. Also since our shellcode ，  * requires EBP to contain a usuable stack address , we overwrite saved EBP also.",
