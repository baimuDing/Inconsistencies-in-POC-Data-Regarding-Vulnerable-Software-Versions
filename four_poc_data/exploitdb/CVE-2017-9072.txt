With RSA's award-winning products, organizations effectively detect,\r ， investigate, and respond to advanced attacks; confirm and manage identities;\r ， and ultimately, reduce IP theft, fraud, and cybercrime.\"\r ， Source: \r ， Business recommendation:\r ， By exploiting the vulnerabilities documented in this advisory an attacker can\r ， obtain sensitive information from the RSA Authentication Manager file system,\r ， initiate arbitrary TCP connections or cause DoS. In addition to this, clients\r ， of the RSA Authentication manager can be affected by exploiting client-side\r ， issues.\r ， SEC Consult recommends to apply the available patches from the vendor.\r ， Vulnerability overview/description:\r ， 1) XML External Entity Injection (XXE) (CVE-2018-1247)\r ， The used XML parser is resolving XML external entities which allows an\r ， authenticated attacker (or an attacker that is able to trick an authenticated\r ， user into importing malicious XML files) to read files, send requests to\r ， systems on the internal network (e.g port scanning) or cause a DoS (e.g.\r ， billion laughs attack).\r ， This issue has been fixed by RSA as described in the advisory DSA-2018-086.\r ， 2) Cross-site Flashing\r ， The vulnerable flash file does not filter or escape the user input\r ， sufficiently. This leads to a reflected cross-site scripting vulnerability.\r ， With reflected cross-site scripting, an attacker can inject arbitrary HTML or\r ， JavaScript code into the victim's web browser. Once the victim clicks a\r ， malicious link the attacker's code is executed in the context of the victim's\r ， web browser.\r ， The vulnerability exists in a third party component called pmfso.\r ， This issue has been fixed by RSA as described in the advisory DSA-2018-082.\r ， 3) DOM based Cross-site Scripting\r ， Several client-side scripts handle user supplied data with insufficient\r ， validation before storing it in the DOM. This issue can be exploited to cause\r ， reflected cross-site scripting.\r ， The identified issues exist in third party components. One of the affected\r ， components is PopCalendarX which has an assigned CVE (CVE-2017-9072).\r ， This issue has been fixed by RSA as described in the advisory DSA-2018-082.\r ， Two further issues affecting other third party components are not yet fixed,\r ， as the third party vendor did not supply a patch to RSA yet.\r ， Proof of concept:\r ， 1) XML External Entity Injection (XXE) (CVE-2018-1247)\r ， The Security Console of the RSA Authentication Manager allows authenticated\r ， users to"
