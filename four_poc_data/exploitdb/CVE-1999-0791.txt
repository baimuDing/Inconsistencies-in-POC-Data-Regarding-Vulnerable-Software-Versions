    "text": "ecve : CVE-1999-0791 ， title : Hybrid Networks Cable Broadband Access System 1.0 - Remote Configuration - Hardware remote Exploit ， verified : Verified ， exploit_detail : source :  ， Hybrid Network's cable modems are vulnerable to several different types of attack due to a lack of authentication for the remote administration/configuration system. The cable modems use a protocol called HSMP , which uses UDP as its transport layer protocol. This makes it trivial to spoof packets and possible for hackers to compromise cable-modem subscribers anonymously. The possible consequences of this problem being exploited are very serious and range from denial of service attacks to running arbitrary code on the modem.",
