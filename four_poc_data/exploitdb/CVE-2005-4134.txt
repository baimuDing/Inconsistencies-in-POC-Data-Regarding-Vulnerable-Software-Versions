An attacker may trigger this issue by enticing a user to visit a malicious website and by supplying excessive data to be stored in the affected file. ， This may cause a denial-of-service condition. ， UPDATE : Proof-of-concept exploit code has been published. The author of the code attributes the crash to a buffer-overflow condition. Symantec has not reproduced the alleged flaw. ， < ! -- Firefox 1.5 buffer overflow ， Basically firefox logs all kinda of URL data in it's history.dat file ,  ， this little script will set a really large topic and Firefox will then ， save that topic into it's history.dat.. The next time that firefox is ， opened , it will instantly crash due to a buffer overflow -- this will ， happen everytime until you manually delete the history.dat file -- which ， most users won't figure out. ， this proof of concept will only prevent someone from reopening ， their browser after being exploited. DoS if you will. however , code ， execution is possible with some modifcations. ， Tested with Firefox 1.5 on Windows XP SP2. ， ZIPLOCK <sickbeatz @ gmail.com> ， -->",
