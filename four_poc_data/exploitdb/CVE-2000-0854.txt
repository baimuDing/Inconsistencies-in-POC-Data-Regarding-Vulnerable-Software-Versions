    "text": "ecve : CVE-2000-0854 ， title : Microsoft Windows NT 4.0/2000 - DLL Search Path - Windows local Exploit ， verified : Verified ， exploit_detail : source :  ， When a program executes under Microsoft Windows , it may require additional code stored in DLL library files. These files are dynamically located at run time , and loaded if necessary. A weakness exists in the algorithm used to locate these files. ， The search algorithm used to locate DLL files specifies that the current working directory is checked before the System folders. If a trojaned DLL can be inserted into the system in an arbitrary location , and a predictable executable called with the same current working directory , the trojaned DLL may be loaded and executed. This may occur when a data file is accessed through the 'Run' function , or double clicked in Windows Explorer. ， This has been reported to occur with the 'riched20.dll' and 'msi.dll' DLL files and some Microsoft Office applications , including WordPad. ， This behavior has also been reported for files loaded from UNC shares , or directly from FTP servers. ， // dll1.cpp : Defines the entry point for the DLL application.",
