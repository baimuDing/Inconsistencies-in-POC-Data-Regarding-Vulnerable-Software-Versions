Unlike the Administrative Web Server the Enrollment Web Server does not require credentials to be exchanged before a user can talk to the webserver. It is via this virtual server that an attacker can exploit the problem at hand. The following is taken directly from the CORE SDI advisory on this issue :  ， \"User supplied URL's are processed by Strong.exe. If a url with an .XUDA extension is found , the request is forwarded to XUDAD.EXE for further processing.

Somewhere along the processing path , the user supplied data becomes the format string for a formatted output function similar to the ANSI C s",
