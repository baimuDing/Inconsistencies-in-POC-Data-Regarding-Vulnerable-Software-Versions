An attacker must first obtain the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system in order to exploit this vulnerability. ， The specific flaw exists within the processing of IOCTL 0x95382673 by the windrvr1240 kernel driver. The issue lies in the failure to properly validate user-supplied data which can result in a kernel pool overflow. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code under the context of kernel. ， Timeline :  ， 2017-08-22 Verified and sent to Jungo via sales @ /first @ /security @ /info @ jungo.com ， 2017-08-25 No response from Jungo and two bounced emails ， 2017-08-26 Attempted a follow up with the vendor via website chat ， 2017-08-26 No response via the website chat ， 2017-09-03 Recieved an email from a Jungo representative stating that they are \"looking into it\" ， 2017-09-03 Requested a timeframe for patch development and warned of possible 0day release ， 2017-09-06 No response from Jungo ， 2017-09-06 Public 0day release of advisory ， Exploitation :  ， This exploit uses a data only attack via the Quota Process Pointer Overwrite technique. We smash the token's _SEP_TOKEN_PRIVILEGES->Enabled and dec the controlled address by 0x50 ( size of the Mutant ) to enable SeDebugPrivilege's. Then we inject code into a system process. ， Note that this exploit doesn't use any kernel mode shellcode : -> ， Example : ",
