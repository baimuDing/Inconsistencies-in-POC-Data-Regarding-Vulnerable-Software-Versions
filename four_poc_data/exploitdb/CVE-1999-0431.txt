    "text": "ecve : CVE-1999-0431 ， title : Linux Kernel 2.1.89/2.2.x - Zero-Length Fragment - Linux dos Exploit ， verified : Verified ， exploit_detail : / *  ， source :  ， Linux kernel versions 2.1.89 to 2.2.3 are vulnerable to a denial of service attack caused when a 0-length IP fragment is received , if it is the first fragment in the list. Several thousands 0-length packets must be sent in order for this to initiate a denial of service against the target. ，  * / ， / *  ，  * sesquipedalian.c - Demonstrates a DoS bug in Linux 2.1.89 - 2.2.3 ，  * by horizon <jmcdonal @ unf.edu> ，  * This sends a series of IP fragments such that a 0 length fragment is first ，  * in the fragment list. This causes a reference count on the cached routing ，  * information for that packet's originator to be incremented one extra time. ，  * This makes it impossible for the kernel to deallocate the destination entry ，  * and remove it from the cache. ，  * If we send enough fragments such that there are at least 4096 stranded ，  * dst cache entries , then the target machine will no longer be able to ，  * allocate new cache entries , and IP communication will be effectively ，  * disabled. You will need to set the delay such that packets are not being ，  * dropped , and you will probably need to let the program run for a few ，  * minutes to have the full effect. This was written for OpenBSD and Linux. ，  * Thanks to vacuum , colonwq , duke , rclocal , sygma , and antilove for testing. ，  * /",
