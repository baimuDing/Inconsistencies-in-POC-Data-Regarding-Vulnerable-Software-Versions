    "text": "ecve : CVE-1999-0215 ， title : SGI IRIX 3/4/5/6 / OpenLinux 1.0/1.1 - routed traceon - IRIX remote Exploit ， verified : Verified ， exploit_detail : // source :  ， routed is a daemon used to dynamically update network routing tables. Certain operating systems ( including IRIX 3.x up to 6.4 inclusive , Caldera OpenLinux 1.0 and 1.1 ) contain a routed version which allows attackers to write limited data to arbitrary files , with root privileges. routed communicates using the Routing Information Protocol ( RIP - RFC1058 , RFC1723 ) . An obsolete command specified by this protocol is \"traceon , \" which turns on certain debugging features and logs information to a file specified in the RIP packet. ， Attackers can construct packets ( typically with spoofed source addresses ) to turn on this feature and cause routed to append debugging information to the specified trace file. Although the information thus written is limited to the normal routed debugging output , the files specified could include /dev files and therefore this could lead to a number of damaging scenarios including memory and disk corruption , denial of service , etc. ， / *  ，  * BSD 4.4 based routed trace file exploit ，  *  ( C ) 1997 Rootshell [  ]  ，  * <info @ rootshell.com> ，  * routed has the ability for a packet to be sent to the daemon that will ，  * turn on debug mode. The packet is able to specify the file which is ，  * later opened without any checks being placed on that file open. ，  * Result : You can append to any file on the filesystem. ，  * The following syscall is made AS ROOT. ，  * ftrace = fopen ( file , \"a\" )  ;  ，  * This is obviously a LARGE problem. ，  * Solaris 2.6 seems to ignore these packets and returns the following ，  * error. Mileage may vary.. :  ，  * in.routed [ 6580 ]  : trace command from 1.2.3.4 - ignored ，  * Redhat routed was tested and found to check if the packet came from ，  * a valid router. If you spoof the RIP packet from their default ，  * gateway the packet is ACCEPTED. ，  * Note : Once a trace file is opened you must close the trace file and then ，  * open another file. ，  * Exploit tested under Linux 2.0.x. ，  * ps. Just run gated !  (  ，  * / ， / * File to append to on filesystem with debug output * /",
