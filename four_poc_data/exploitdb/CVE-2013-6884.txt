Therefore IT forensic experts use write-blockers to ， ensure a read-only access to evidence data like hard disks or USB mass ， storage. ， The Ditto Forensic FieldStation is such a special equipment ( hardware with ， embedded software ) used by forensic experts to analyse and copy evidence data ， in a safe and secure way. The ditto is explicitly marketed as a device to ， acquire data from network file shares , too. This means it is meant to be ， connected to possibly hostile networks of suspects. ， However it was found to be vulnerable up to the point of not being reliable as ， a computer forensic device. ， 1 ] ======== OS Command Injection ======== ， Class : Command Injection [ CWE-77 ]  ， Impact : Code execution ， Remotely Exploitable : Yes ， CVE Name : CVE-2013-6881 ， CVSS v2 Base Score : 10 ， Overall CVSS v2 Score : 9.2 ， CVSS v2 Vector :  ，  ( AV : N/AC : L/Au : N/C : C/I : C/A : C/E : H/RL : O/RC : C/CDP : MH/TD : ND/CR : H/IR : H/AR : L )  ， Several input fields of the web application are vulnerable to OS command ， injection. E.g. the application allows the setting of parameters like 'sector ， size' or 'skip count' for a forensic imaging task. Because of improper ， neutralization in combination with the web server running with root ， privileges , an attacker is able to access and manipulate the complete system. ， Example 1 ( setting of 'sector size' = 1 with malicious content )  :  ， 1 ; ",
