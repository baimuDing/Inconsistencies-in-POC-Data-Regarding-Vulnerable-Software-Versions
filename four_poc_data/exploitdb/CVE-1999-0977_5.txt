    "text": "ecve : CVE-1999-0977 ， title : Solaris 2.5/2.5.1/2.6/7.0 - 'sadmind' Remote Buffer Overflow ( 4 ) - Solaris remote Exploit ， verified : Verified ， exploit_detail : // source :  ， Certain versions of Solaris ship with a version of sadmind which is vulnerable to a remotely exploitable buffer overflow attack. sadmind is the daemon used by Solstice AdminSuite applications to perform distributed system administration operations such as adding users. The sadmind daemon is started automatically by the inetd daemon whenever a request to invoke an operation is received. ， Under vulnerable versions of sadmind ( 2.6 and 7.0 have been tested )  , if a long buffer is passed to a NETMGT_PROC_SERVICE request ( called via clnt_call (  )  )  , it is possible to overwrite the stack pointer and execute arbitrary code. The actual buffer in questions appears to hold the client's domain name. The overflow in sadmind takes place in the get_auth (  ) function , part of the /usr/snadm/lib/libmagt.so.2 library. Because sadmind runs as root any code launched as a result will run as with root privileges , therefore resulting in a root compromise. ， /\\ ， Super Solaris sadmin Exploit - Based on sadminex by Cheez Whiz ， by optyx <optyx @ uberhax0r.net> ， based on sadminsparc. and sadminx86.c by Cheez Whiz ， \\/",
