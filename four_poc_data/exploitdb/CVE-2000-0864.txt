    "text": "ecve : CVE-2000-0864 ， title : GNOME esound 0.2.19 - Unix Domain Socket Race Condition - Unix local Exploit ， verified : Verified ， exploit_detail : source :  ， EsounD , part of the GNOME desktop environment , is a server process allowing several applications to share the same sound hardware. ， Versions of esound up to and including 0.2.19 create a world-writable directory ( /tmp/.esd ) which is also used to store a domain socket used by esound. ， The unix domain socket is also created world-writeable. A race condition exists when this socket is created such that if an attacker creates a symbolic link in the world-writeable /tmp/.esd directory at the right time , the file pointed to by it will be changed to a world-writeable mode. The target file , of course , would have to be owned by the user running ESound. This vulnerability may have to do with a lack of checking return values when binding the address structure to the domain socket before setting permissions on the file , but this is uncomfirmed as are the exact technical details of this vulnerability. ， Patches :  ， --- esd.h.orig Thu Jun 29 23 : 12 : 53 2000 ， +++ esd.h Thu Jun 29 23 : 12 : 41 2000 ， -7 , 8 +7 , 15 ，  # endif ， / * path and name of the default EsounD domain socket * / ， + # if 0",
