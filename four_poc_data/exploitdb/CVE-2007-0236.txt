As you can see from the above , the reason us due to the ，  * fact the buffer size is absurd. The system caught this absurdity and ，  * handled it by calling panic (  ) . ，  * In other words , not capable of executing arbitrary code.\" ，  * -- Rosyna Keller , talking about allocbuf (  ) failing due to allocation ，  * of a negative size buffer , caused by a simple integer overflow. ，  * \">LMH claims # 10 leads to \"potential arbitrary code execution.\" That's ，  * >not good enough where I come from. Either the arbitrary code executes ,  ，  * >or it doesn't. I may be talking thru my elbow , but I suggest the ，  * >absence of a working example of \"arbitrary code execution\" is that we ，  * >have caused a kernel panic , and stack based execution ceases.\" ，  * -- dinornis , stack based haxor in training. ，  * /",
