    "text": "ecve : CVE-2004-0200 ， title : Microsoft Windows - JPEG GDI+ Remote Heap Overflow ( MS04-028 ) - Windows remote Exploit ， verified : Verified ， exploit_detail : / ，  * GDI+ JPEG Remote Exploit ，  * By John Bissell A.K.A. HighT1mes ，  * Exploit Name :  ，  * ============= ，  * JpegOfDeath.c v0.5 ，  * Date Exploit Released :  ，  * ====================== ，  * Sep , 23 , 2004 ，  * Description :  ，  * ============ ，  * Exploit based on FoToZ exploit but kicks the exploit up ，  * a notch by making it have reverse connectback as well as ，  * bind features that will work with all NT based OS's. ，  * WinNT , WinXP , Win2K , Win2003 , etc... Thank you FoToz for ，  * helping get a grip on the situation. I actually had got ，  * bind jpeg exploit working earlier but I could only ，  * trigger from OllyDbg due to the heap dynamically changing... ，  * If anyone who uses this exploit has used my recent AIM ，  * remote exploit then you will have a good idea already of how ，  * to use this exploit correctly. ，  * Through my limited testing I have found on a unpatched ，  * XP SP1 system that if you click the exploit jpeg file ，  * in Windows Explorer then you will be hacked. I know there ，  * are more attack points you can take advantage of if you ，  * look for them.. So say someone goes on any web browser ，  * and they decide to save your jpeg and then later open it ，  * in explorer.exe then they will be attacked.. or maybe they ，  * got a email that has a good filename attachment title to ，  * it like \"daisey fuentes porn pic.jpg\" well then they ，  * want to see it so they save it to there harddrive and open ，  * the pic in explorer.exe and game over. You just have to ，  * test and get creative. The reason this is version 0.5 is ，  * because I know rundll32.exe is MAJORALLY exploitable and I know ，  * that would make this exploit far more powerful if I ，  * figured that part out.. I have already exploited it ，  * personally myself but I need to run some more tests to ，  * make things final for everyone... On another side note ，  * for the people out there who think you can only be affected ，  * through viewing or downloading a jpeg attachment.. you're ，  * dead wrong.. All the attacker has to do is simply change ，  * image extension from .jpg to .bmp or .tif or whatever ，  * and stupid Windows will still treat the file as a JPEG : -p... ，  * Also the fact is this vulnerability is exploitable ，  * without the victim clicking a link... For instance you ，  * send them the image with a 1 , 1 width , height and then' ，  * they can't see it in Outlook Express , so there like ，  * man this image has a cool name so I'll try to open the ，  * attachment , then there FUCKED... Well ok they have to ，  * click in a round-about-way.. but I'm sure if you're ，  * creative enough with all those MS features you can figure ，  * something out ; - )  ，  * I'll most likely be putting out another version of this ，  * exploit ( more dangerous ) once more testing has been done. So ，  * I encourage everyone out there to download SP2 , patch your ，  * Windows systems , etc... Of course this won't be a ，  * cure all solution : -/ ，  * Note :  ，  * ===== ，  * If someone wants to take advantage of the bind mode of ，  * attack in this exploit you will need to set up a script ，  * on a web server to check everyone who downloads the ，  * jpeg exploit file and then connect back to them on the ，  * port you wanted to use with the bind attack... One of ，  * the reasons I decided to keep the bind shellcode option ，  * in here is because sometimes as you people know a ，  * firewall will be more restrictive on outbound connections ，  * and there are times where a bind attack will do just right ，  * if the reverse connect attack won't work... On ANOTHER ，  * note you can also rename your jpeg file extension to ，  * something like a .bmp or .tif and dumb Windows program's ，  *  ( most of them ) won't give give a shit and try to load the ，  * jpeg anyways... You can easily trick unsuspecting people ，  * this way.. which is pretty much everyone.. right?? ，  * Greetings :  ，  * ========== ，  * FoToZ , Nick DeBaggis , MicroSoft , Anthony Rocha ,  # romhack ，  * Peter Winter-Smith , IsolationX , YpCat , Aria Giovanni ,  ，  * Nick Fitzgerald , Adam Nance ( where are you? )  ,  ，  * Santa Barbara , Jenna Jameson , John Kerry , so1o ,  ，  * Computer Security Industry , Rom Hackers , My chihuahuas ，  *  ( Rocky , Sailor , and Penny ) ...",
