The command line parameters are as follows :  ，  $ dvtermtype termtype devicename ， If a malicious user contructs a long termtype string and executes dvtermtype , dvtermtype will stack overflow. This can lead to a root compromise. ， Tridia has different release schedules for each UNIX platform is supports. It is unclear what other UNIX builds of DoubleVision are vulnerable. ， / *  ，  * dvexploit.c ，  * written by : Stephen J. Friedl ，  * Software Consultant ，  * 2000-06-24 ，  * steve @ unixwiz.net ，  * This program exploits the \"Double Vision\" system on SCO ，  * Unixware 7.1.0 via a buffer overflow on the \"dvtermtype\" ，  * program. Double Vision is like a \"pcAnywhere for UNIX\" ,  ，  * but quite a few programs in this distribution are setuid ，  * root. The problem is that these programs were not written ，  * with security in mind , and it's not clear that they even ，  * need to be setuid root. ，  * This particular program exploits \"dvtermtype\" by passing a ，  * very long second parameter that overflows some internal ，  * buffer. This buffer is filled with a predicted address ，  * of the shellcode , and the shellcode itself is stored in ，  * a very long environment variable. This approach makes ，  * the shellcode much easier to find. ，  * This shellcode was based directly on the great work of ，  * Brock Tellier ( btellier @ usa.net )  , who seems to spend a lot ，  * of time within with various SCO UNIX release. Thanks !  ，  * This shellcode runs /tmp/ui , which should be this simple ，  * program :  ，  *  $ cd /tmp ，  *  $ ",
