It plays back CDs , DVDs , and ， VCDs. It also decodes multimedia files like AVI , MOV , WMV , and MP3 from ， local disk drives , and displays multimedia streamed over the ， Internet. It interprets many of the most common multimedia formats available ， - and some of the most uncommon formats , too.\" ， Part 2 in the Media Mayhem saga , a name that was decided as being ， aptly fitting for the \"Media Player\" security audit project that the Open ， Security Group website started at the end of May. This project ， continues finding remote exploits in popular media players for Windows and ， Linux / UNIX derived systems. ， Like the excellent Mplayer , Xine is a superb free media player for ， Linux. Sadly there is a generic stack based buffer overflow in all versions ， of Xine-lib , including Xine-lib-rc5 that allows for local and remote ， malicious code execution. ， By overflowing the vcd : // input source identifier buffer , it is ， possible to modify the instruction pointer with a value that a malicious ， attacker ， can control. The issue can be replicated in a remote context by ， embedding the input source idientifier within a playlist file , such as ， an asx. ， When a user plays the file , this stack overflow will occur , exploit ， code can then be executed with the rights of the user running Xine. ， The problem slightly increases due to a usability feature. It does ， not have to be an asx extension for exploitation to succeed as Xine will try ， to be clever and play any media type found , providing it's valid. ， This still means the attack vector MUST include the .asx input ， identifier but ， it means you can not even trust URL's for .mp3 , .mpeg , .mpg or .avi ， media. As long as Xine finds a valid media header , it's happy to change ， the demuxer reference and play the found media. In this case it's a ， playlist file , \".asx\" , though others should work. ， Any of the following demuxors will work when running against the ， attached",
