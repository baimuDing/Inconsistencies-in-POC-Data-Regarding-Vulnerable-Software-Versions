Failed exploit attempts will likely cause denial-of-service conditions. ， / *  ，  | 48Bits Advisory -=- Privilege Elevation in eTrust Antivirus Agent r8 |  ， Affected versions :  ， I have tested with :  ， - eTrust Antivirus Agent r8 - ，  ( With INOCORE.DLL 8.0.403.0 ) under XPSP2 and W2KSP4 )  ， Description :  ， eTrust Antivirus r8 is prone to a stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability. ， The Affected component is \"eTrust Task service\" running as a Windows service ,  ， the executable file is located at :  ， \"%PROGRAMFILES%\\CA\\eTrustITM\\InoTask.exe\" ， eTrust Task service uses a shared file mapping named \"INOQSIQSYSINFO\" as an ， IPC mechanism , this file mapping have a NULL security descriptor so anyone ， can view/modify it. This mapping contains information about scheduled tasks ,  ， including a field where is specified the file jobs path. ， The vulnerable code is located at IN0CORE.DLL in the function QSIGetQueueID ， which internally calls QSIGetQuePath passing a fixed buffer in order to ， retrieve the queue path , no validation is done for the buffer size. ， In order to exploit the vulnerability , malicious users can modify directly ， the buffer through the file mapping with a long file path , so when InnoTask ， read it the mentioned stack-based buffer overflow will be triggered. ， Technical notes about the",
