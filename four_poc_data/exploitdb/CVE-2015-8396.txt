    "text": "ecve : CVE-2015-8396 ， title : Grassroots DICOM ( GDCM ) 2.6.0 and 2.6.1 - ImageRegionReader :  : ReadIntoBuffer Buffer Overflow - Linux dos Exploit ， verified : Not Verified ， exploit_detail : / *  ， Grassroots DICOM ( GDCM ) is a C++ library for processing DICOM medical ， images. ， It provides routines to view and manipulate a wide range of image formats ， and can be accessed through many popular programming languages like Python ,  ， C #  , Java and PHP. ， GDCM versions 2.6.0 and 2.6.1 ( and possibly previous versions ) are prone ， to an ， integer overflow vulnerability which leads to a buffer overflow and ， potentially to remote code execution. The vulnerability is triggered by the ， exposed function gdcm :  : ImageRegionReader :  : ReadIntoBuffer , which copies ， DICOM ， image data to a buffer. ReadIntoBuffer checks whether the supplied ， buffer is ， large enough to hold the necessary data , however in this check it fails to ， detect the occurrence of an integer overflow , which leads to a buffer ， overflow ， later on in the code. The buffer overflow will occur regardless of the ， size of ， the buffer supplied to the ReadIntoBuffer call. ， More information about this vulnerability can be found at ， The GDCM project has released version 2.6.2 that addresses this issue. ， It is advised to upgrade all GDCM installations to the latest stable ， release.",
