    "text": "ecve : CVE-2001-0925 ， title : Apache 1.3 - Artificially Long Slash Path Directory Listing ( 4 ) - Multiple remote Exploit ， verified : Verified ， exploit_detail : source :  ， Apache HTTPD is the Apache Web Server , freely distributed and actively maintained by the Apache Software Foundation. It is a freely available and widely used software package , included with various implementations of the UNIX operating system and can be used on Microsoft Windows operating systems. ， A problem in the package could allow directory indexing and path discovery. In a default configuration , Apache enables mod_dir , mod_autoindex , and mod_negotiation. However , by sending the Apache server a custom-crafted request consisting of a long path name created artificially by using numerous slashes , an attacker can cause these modules to misbehave , allowing the attacker to escape the error page and to gain a listing of the directory contents. ， This vulnerability allows a malicious remote user to launch an information-gathering attack , which could potentially result in a compromise of the system. Additionally , this vulnerability affects all releases of Apache previous to 1.3.19. ，  #  ! /usr/bin/perl ，  # orginal by farm9 , Inc. ( copyright 2001 )  ，  # new modified code by Siberian ( www.sentry-labs.com )  ，  # Note : This isn't the orginal exploit ! This one was modified and partly rewritten. ，  # Changes :  ，  # - help added ( more user firendly : - )  )  ，  # - messages added ，  # - exploit is now able to be executed on WinNT or 2k. ，  # - uses perl version of BSD sockets ( compatible to Windows )  ，  # Rewriter's Note : I rewrote ( I was bored to death that evening : - )  ) some ，  # of the code and made it esaier to use and cross platform compatible. ，  # The old verion used a esaier but not that compaible way of socket stream communication. ，  # Any network code was replaced by cross platform compatible BSD sockets. ，  #  ( much better than any other stream method : - )  )  ，  # Tested with Perl 5.6 ( Linux ) and ActivePerl 5.6 ( Win32 )  ，  # Original comment and source is attached below. ，  # Name : Apache Artificially Long Slash Path Directory Listing Exploit ，  # Author : Matt Watchinski ，  # Ref : SecurityFocus BID 2503 ，  # Affects : Apache 1.3.17 and below",
