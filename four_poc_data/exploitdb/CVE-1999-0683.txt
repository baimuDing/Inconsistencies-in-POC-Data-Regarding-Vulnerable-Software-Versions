    "text": "ecve : CVE-1999-0683 ， title : Network Associates Gauntlet Firewall 5.0 - Denial of Service - Hardware dos Exploit ， verified : Verified ， exploit_detail : // source :  ， There is a vulnerability in Gauntlet Firewall 5.0 which allows an attacker to remotely cause a denial of service. The vulnerability occurs because Gauntlet Firewall cannot handle a condition where an ICMP Protocol Problem packet's ( ICMP_PARAMPROB ) encapsulated IP packet has a random protocol field and certain IP options set. When this specially constructed packet (  [ ICMP PARAMPROB ]  [ IP with random protocol code and some ip options ]  ) is sent THROUGH the Gauntlet Firewall ( not to the firewall itself )  , the firewall will hang , looking for the packet in it's transparency tables. ， The packet structure looks like this :  ， Begin Packet ，  [ NORMAL IP HEADER ]  ，  [ ICMP PARAMPROB HEADER ]  ， -- encapsulated ip packet -- ，  [ IP HEADER ]  ，  ( important fields in ip header )  ， ip_p = 98 ( let's specify a protocol that doesn't exist )  ， ip_hl = 0xf ( stuff options )  ， End Packet ， An attacker would do the following :  ， Construct the [ ip-icmp-ip ] packet using a raw socket ( SOCK_RAW ) with the fields set accordingly , destination set to any machine behind the firewall. ， Send the packet ( s ) . ， The number of packets that need to be sent depends on the platform ( ie Sol on a Sparc vs BSDI ) . ， The consequence of this vulnerability being exploited is the target Gauntlet 5.0 firewall being remotely locked up. It should be expected that an attacker would send packets with spoofed source addresses in the ip header making it difficult to trace. ， / *  ，  * Discovered and written by : <godot @ msg.net> <- Send money to : - )  ，  * aka Mike Frantzen <frantzen @ expert.cc.purdue.edu> <- Reply to ，  * Network Associates : \"Who's watching your network?\" ，  * MSG.net \"Who's watching the watchers?\" ，  * This can be found online at ，  * Description :  ，  * If you know an IP that will be routed through a Gauntlet 5.0 Firewall ,  ，  * you can remotely lock up the firewall ( tested against Solaris 2.6 and ，  * BSDI ) . It locks up to the point that one packet will disable STOP-A ，  *  ( L1-A ) on Sparcs and ~ 3-5 packets will disable Ctrl-Alt-Del on BSDI ，  *  ( Ctrl-Alt-Del still prompts Y/N but it never reboots ) . ，  * You can NOT send this to the Gauntlet's IP. The packet must be one ，  * that would go through the forwarding code. ，  * If you are on local ether to the firewall , set it as your default route ，  * or otherwise send the packet to the firewall's MAC. ，  * The packet is parsed before the packet filtering rules in Gauntlet. So ，  * the only known work-around is to ACL out ICMP type 12 at your screening ，  * router. ，  * Or you could switch to Gauntlet 5.5 which ( in the beta ) does not seem to ，  * be vulnerable -- but 5.5 introduces some new 'issues'.",
