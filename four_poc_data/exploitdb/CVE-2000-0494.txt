Volume Manager is a popular disk management package. Volume Manager running on Solaris platforms prior to Solaris 8 are vulnerable. ， Upon startup , the /etc/rc2.d/S96vmsa-server script is executed. It never explicitly sets a umask , and therefore inherits the parent umask , which is unset. When the server starts , it creates a file named .server_pids , in the directory /var/opt/vmsa/logs. As no umask is set , its permissions are set to 666. ( user , group and world readable and writable ) . ， The control script used to control various aspects of the Storage Administrator server will , upon getting a request to stop the server , execute the contents of the .server_pids file. As any user can alter the contents of the .server_pids file , a would be attacker can execute arbitrary commands by placing them in the .server_pids file , and waiting for an administrator to call the stop routine of the control script ( /opt/VRTSvmsa/bin/vmsa_server ) . This will cause the code in the .server_pids file to be executed as the user running the script. In most cases this will be root. ， This vulnerability requires that the administrator run the vmsa_server script with the stop command. It will not be invoked upon a shutdown. ， Solaris 8 machines are not susceptible to this vulnerability , as the umask of the system is set to 022 prior to the execution of the /etc/rc2.d/S96vmsa-server script. As a result , the .server_pids file is created non-world and non-group writable , and the contents of this file cannot be altered. ， foo @ bar> id ， uid=500 ( foo ) gid=25 ( programmers )  ， foo @ bar> ls -alt /var/opt/vmsa/logs/.server_pids ， -rw-rw-rw- 1 root root 27 Jun 8 16 : 06 /var/opt/vmsa/logs/.server_pids ， foo @ bar>",
