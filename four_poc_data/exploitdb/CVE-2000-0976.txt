It is not verified that the amount data is within the predefined size limits before it is copied onto the stack during function calls. ， Consequently it is possible for users to overwrite stack variables such as the calling function's return address with arbitrary values that can alter the program's flow of execution. ， While this vulnerability permits only numeric characters to be written to the stack , a successful exploit of this vulnerability can lead to partial overwriting of addresses and local variables. ， cwsys $ DISPLAY= : `perl -e '{",
