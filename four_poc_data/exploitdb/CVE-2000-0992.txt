    "text": "ecve : CVE-2000-0992 ， title : OpenSSH 1.2 - '.scp' File Create/Overwrite - Linux remote Exploit ， verified : Verified ， exploit_detail : source :  ， A vulnerability exists in the 1.2.x releases of scp which , if properly exploited using a modified scp binary on the server end , can permit the remote server to spoof local pathnames and overwrite files belonging to the local user. ， For example , following the command ， scp user @ remotehost : /somefile /home/user/newfile ， the modified server on the remote machine maliciously sends the filename as ../../etc/passwd ， the local user's scp program will then write the data to ， /home/user/../../etc/passwd ，  ( which is the same as /etc/passwd )  ， Note that the target file can only be overwritten if the local user has write access to it. As a result , it remains inadvisable to run scp as root. ， This vulnerability applies to 1.2.x versions of ssh on the remote machine , irrespective of the version running as the client. ， ssh-2.x on the remote employs a different protocol and as a result is reportedly not vulnerable to this bug. ， As a proof of concept , I created trivial scp replacement ( put it on remote machine in the place of original scp binary - usually in /usr/local/bin ) . ， It will try to exploit any file transfer , creating setuid /tmp/ScpIsBuggy file on client system :  ，  #  !
