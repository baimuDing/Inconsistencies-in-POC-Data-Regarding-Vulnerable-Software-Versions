The help files are stored in the %SystemRoot%\\help directory. The default permissions in this directory allow any user to add new files. ， // A buffer overflow exists in the Help utility when it attempts to read a .cnt file with an overly long heading string. Content tab informaton files ( \"\".cnt\"\" ) are generated when rich text format files ( \"\".rtf\"\" ) are translated to help files ( \"\".hlp\"\" ) . If the string is longer than 507 bytes winhlp32 truncates the entry and the buffer overflow does not occur. ， // A malicious user can create a custom .cnt help file with executable code in an entry string which when stored in the help directory and viewed by an unsuspecting user can grant them that users privileges. ， // The vulnerability is not limited by the permissions of the help file directory as the Help utility will search for a .cnt file first in its execution directory before looking in the help file directory.",
