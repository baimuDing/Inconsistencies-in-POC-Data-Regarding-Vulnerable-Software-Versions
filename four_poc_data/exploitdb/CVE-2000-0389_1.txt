These include MIT Kerberos 5 releases 1.0.x , 1.1 and 1.1.1 , MIT Kerberos 4 patch level 10 ( and , most likely , prior releases )  , and Cygnus KerbNet and Network Security ( CNS ) . The main source of problems is due to a buffer overflow in the krb_rd_req (  ) library function. This function is used by every application that supports Kerberos 4 authentication , including , but not limited to , kshrd , klogin , telnetd , ftpd , rkinitd , v4rcp and kpopd. Therefore , it is possible for a remote attacker to exploit this vulnerability and gain root access on affected machines , or obtain root level access once local. ， A setuid version of v4rcp is shipped with RedHat Linux 6.2 , as part of a full install. It is possible to use this program , to obtain root level access. ， In addition , there are other buffer overruns present in the ksu and krshd sources from MIT. These problems will be remedied in the same release from MIT that fixes the krrb_rd_req (  ) vulnerability. ， / *  ， klogin remote buffer overflow ， by duke ( duke @ viper.net.au )  ， tested on BSDI 4.0.1 klogin. ， The bug is actually in the kerberos library so this ， affects all kerb services ( kerbIV ) . This code should need ， minimal ( if any ) modification to use on other kerberos services. ， it will only work if the file /etc/kerberosIV/krb.conf exists. ， -duke ，  * /",
