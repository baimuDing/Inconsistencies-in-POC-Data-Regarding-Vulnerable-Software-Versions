Under some circumstances , a remotely supplied signed value is used as an array index , allowing NULL bytes to be written to arbitrary memory locations. Exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to the corruption of the stack , and possibly to execution of arbitrary code as the root user. ， It is possible that other versions of rsync share this vulnerability. ， / *  ，  * linux rsync <= 2.5.1 remote exploit by sorbo ( sorbox @ yahoo.com )  ，  * this is a simple frame pointer overflow :  ，  * in exclude.c in recv_exclude_list (  )  , l is declared as int. ，  * we can pass a negative value for l and fool l >= MAXPATHLEN ，  * read_sbuf will in turn do a buf [ len ] = 0 ;  ( without performing any reads )  ，  * we can modify read_sbuf's saved frame pointer by putting a 0 in the LSB. ，  * When read_sbuf exits the stack pointer will be set to the modified value ，  * we then pop a return address that lies on line [  ] where we can make it point to our shellcode ，  * ... quite simple =D ，  * NOTE : in configuration chroot must be false ，  * running : ./sorsync -b -v 127.0.0.1 ，  * should work on any linux =D ，  * greetz :  ，  *  # darkircop @ undernet ，  * kewlcat @ efnet ( for telling me about the bug )  ，  * gunzip @ ircnet ( moral support =P )  ，  * /",
