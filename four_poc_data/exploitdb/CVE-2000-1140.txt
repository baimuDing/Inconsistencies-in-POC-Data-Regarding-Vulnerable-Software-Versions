    "text": "ecve : CVE-2000-1140 ， title : ManTrap 1.6.1 - Hidden Process Disclosure - Unix local Exploit ， verified : Verified ， exploit_detail : // source :  ， ManTrap is a \"honeypot\" intrusion detection system designed to lure attackers into it for analysis. The honeypot is implemented as a chroot'ed Solaris environment , designed to look and feel real to an attacker who gains access to it. To ensure that the \"lured\" hacker doesn't realize that they are on a ManTrap host , certain processes must be hidden. One of the ways this is accomplished in ManTrap is through kernel modules that prevent /proc entries from being created for these processes. Unfortunately this is trivial to bypass through comparing process information retrieved directly from kernel memory to the contents of /proc. ， The kill (  ) system call does not read from /proc. A hacker may , for example , write a program to send SIGCONT ( or another signal usually ignored ) to incrementing process ID's verifying valid PIDs ( that dont belong to them ) by the errno value generated by kill (  )  ( EEPERM ) . The valid PIDs that are not in /proc would be the 'hidden' processes. ， / *  ，  * ManTrap detection/testing program by wilson / f8labs - www.f8labs.org ，  * /",
