MSRC 8769 , MS09-054 , CVE-2009-1547 , Data Stream Header Corruption Vulnerability )  ， Microsoft fixed a bug in Internet Explorers Content-Encoding : deflate implementation. Here are two HTTP replies that trigger the bug :  ， HTTP/.\\nContent-Encoding : deflate\\r\\t\\n\\r\\n\\x20\\x20 ， HTTP \\nContent-Encoding : deflate\\nContent-Range : \\n\\n ， The bug allows memory corruption , which can be exploited to execute arbitrary code. The big surprise ( to me at least ) is that nobody seems to have found this before even though its fairly easy to trigger.",
