Specifically , when the binary is invoked a predictable temporary file is created. A local attacker may exploit this issue to launch symbolic link style attacks ultimately resulting in elevated privileges. ， The second issue that has been reported to exist in the ontape binary. The ontape binary has been reported to be prone to a local stack based buffer overflow vulnerability. Ultimately the attacker may exploit this condition to influence execution flow of the vulnerable binary into attacker-controlled memory. This may lead to the execution of arbitrary instructions with elevated privileges. ， A third issue has been reported to affect the onshowaudit binary. Specifically , the onshowaudit binary reads data from temporary files contained in the \"tmp? directory. These files have predictable filenames ; an attacker may exploit this issue to disclose data that may be used in further attacks launched against the vulnerable system. ， / * Exploit informix 8or user with DSA privileges -> root in a Informix IDSv9.40. it seems to ， exist a correct environment variable size checking for INFORMIXDIR ( old security nightmare in ， other versions ) but forgot to check ONCONFIG env vble size. ， We can found similar ONCONFIG overflows , but In other binaries in this installation exists a ， setuid32 ( 0x1f7 )  ( the uid for informix user in my installation ) before the bof occurs. ， Unfortunately not in this binary ， Vulnerability researched by Juan Manuel Pascual Escriba ， 08/08/2003 Barcelona - Spain pask @ open3s.com ，  * /",
