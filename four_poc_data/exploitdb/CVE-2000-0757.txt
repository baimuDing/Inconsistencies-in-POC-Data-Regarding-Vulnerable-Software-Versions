    "text": "ecve : CVE-2000-0757 ， title : Aptis Software TotalBill 3.0 - Remote Command Execution - Linux remote Exploit ， verified : Verified ， exploit_detail : // source :  ， Aptis Software offers a billing / provisioning solution for ISPs called TotalBill. One component of the TotalBill package is a network service called Sysgen that listens on or around port 9998. It allows a client connectiing to it to execute any command on the host it is running on ( with whatever uid the service runs as , typically root ) without any authentication. If this service is not filtered , anonymous attackers can easily gain root access on the target host by remotely exploiting this naive service. Other components of TotalBill may be vulnerable also ( noteably cc_queue to a buffer overflow attack ) but none are confirmed.",
