This system call arranges for the kernel to sample the PC and increment an element of an array on every profile clock tick. ， The security issue stems from the fact that profiling is not turned off when a process execve ( 2 ) 's another program image. ， As the size and location of this array as well as the scale factor are under the program's control , it is possible to arrange for an arbitrary 16-bit program virtual address to be incremented on each profile clock tick. ， Although unlikely , it is theoretically possible that an attacker with local access and knowledge of the addresses used by privileged programs could construct an exploit. ， It may be that there are no candidate addresses that , when incremented , result in a security failure. However , as this can turn -1 into 0 , and 0 into 1 , and as security-related system calls and library functions often return either -1 or 0 , this mechanism could turn system call returns of success into failure or failure into success if a program stores system call results into memory locations. ，  * / ， / * This program will check to see if a given system has the profil ( 2 ) bug ， described in NetBSD Security Advisory 1999-011.
