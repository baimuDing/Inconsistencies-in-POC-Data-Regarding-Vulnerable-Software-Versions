    "text": "ecve : CVE-2009-0641 ， title : FreeBSD 7.0-RELEASE - Telnet Daemon Privilege Escalation - FreeBSD local Exploit ， verified : Verified ， exploit_detail : FreeBSD ( 7.0-RELEASE ) telnet daemon local privilege escalation - ， And possible remote root code excution. ， There is a rather big bug in the current FreeBSD telnetd daemon. ， The environment is not properly sanitized when execution /bin/login ,  ， what leads to a ( possible ) remote root hole. ， The telnet protocol allows to pass environment variables inside the ， telnet traffic and assign them to the other side of the tcp connection. ， The telnet daemon of FreeBSD does not check for LD_ *  ( like LD_PRELOAD )  ， environment variables prior to executing /bin/login. ， So passing an environment variable with the identifier LD_PRELOAD and ， the value of a precompiled library that is on the filesystem of the ， victims box that includes malicious code is possible. ， When /bin/login is executed with the user id and group id 0 ( 'root' ) it preloads ， the library that was set by remote connection through a telnet environment ， definition and executes it. ， It is unlikely that this bug can be exploited remotely but is not impossible. ， An attacker could f.e. upload a malicious library using ftp ( including anonymous ， ftp users )  , nfs , smb or any other ( file ) transfer protocol. ， One scenario to exploit the bug remotely would be a ftp server running beside ， the telnet daemon serving also anoynmous users with write access. Then the ， attacker would upload the malicious library and defines the LD_PRELOAD ， variable to something similar to /var/ftp/mallib.so to gain remote root access. ， Here comes the actual exploit which can be executed with standard UNIX tools. ， Paste this into a file using your favorite text editor :  ， -snip- ，  # FreeBSD telnetd local/remote privilege escalation/code execution ，  # remote root only when accessible ftp or similar available ，  # tested on FreeBSD 7.0-RELEASE ，  # by Kingcope/2009",
