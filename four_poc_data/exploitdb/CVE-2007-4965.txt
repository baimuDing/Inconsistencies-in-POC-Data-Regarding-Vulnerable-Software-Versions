Remote attackers may be able to do this , depending on the nature of applications that use the vulnerable functions. ， Attackers would likely submit invalid or specially crafted images to applications that perform imageop operations on the data. ， A successful exploit may allow attacker-supplied machine code to run in the context of affected applications , facilitating the remote compromise of computers. ，  #  ! /usr/bin/python",
