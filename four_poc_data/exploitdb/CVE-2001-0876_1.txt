This could permit an attacker to exploit a number of systems without knowing their individual IP addresses , if they employed an exploitation method targeting a UDP port. It is however possible to exploit this condition using either the TCP or UDP protocols. ， The UPnP service runs in the LOCAL SERVICE security context. An attacker who successfully exploits this vulnerability could gain control over the target host. ， / *  ，  * WinME/XP UPNP dos & overflow ，  * Run : ./XPloit host <option> ，  * Windows run the \"Universal Plug and Play technology\" service ，  * at port 5000.
