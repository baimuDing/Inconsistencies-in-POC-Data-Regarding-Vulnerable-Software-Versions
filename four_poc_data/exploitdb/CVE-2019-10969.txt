The first one is a command injection vulnerability found on the CLI allowing an authenticated user to obtain root privileges. And the other one is an improper access control found on the web server allowing to retrieve log files. ， As usual , we reported those issues directly to Moxa and ICS-CERT ( Industrial Control Systems Cyber Emergency Response Team ) in order to responsible disclose them. ， The ICS-CERT advisory was published on their website and a new EDR-810 firmware was provided by Moxa. ， Many thanks to Moxa and ICS-CERT teams for their help. ， Advisory ， The following two product vulnerabilities were identified in Moxas EDR-810 Series Secure Routers , all versions 5.1 and prior are vulnerable :  ， CVE-2019-10969 : An exploitable command injection vulnerability exists in the CLI functionality , which is provided by the Telnet and SSH services.
