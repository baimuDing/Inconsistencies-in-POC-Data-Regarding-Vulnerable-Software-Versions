    "text": "ecve : CVE-1999-0859 ， title : SunOS 4.1.4 - arp ( 8c ) Memory Dump - Solaris local Exploit ， verified : Verified ， exploit_detail : source :  ， The version of arp ( 8c ) which shipped with versions of SunOs 4.1.X could be used to dump system memory by using the -f flag. This flag causes the file filename to be read and multiple entries to be set in the ARP tables. However , in this instance because of poor permission sets on /dev/kmem a user can specify the file to be read as /dev/kmem and therefore gain a dump of currently paged system memory. This could lead to a root compromise. ，  $ arp -f /dev/kmem | strings > mem",
