    "text": "ecve : CVE-2001-0171 ， title : WhitSoft SlimServe HTTPd 1.1 - 'GET' Denial of Service - Windows dos Exploit ， verified : Verified ， exploit_detail : source :  ， SlimServe HTTPd is a free HTTP Daemon maintained by WhitSoft Development. SlimServe is designed to provide basic HTTP services on the Microsoft Windows platform. ， A problem in the handling of HTTP GET requests could allow a remote user to deny service to legitimate users of web services. Upon requesting a long filename from the HTTP server ( estimated 80000 characters )  , the server crashes. Upon ceasing operation , it produces an \"invalid page fault\" error. The service will not operate again until SlimServe is manually restarted. ， It is therefore possible for a malicious remote user to connect to the server and request a long file name , crashing the server , and resulting in a denial of service attack.",
