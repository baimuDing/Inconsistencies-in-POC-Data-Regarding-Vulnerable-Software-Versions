InPerson provides multiway audio and video conferencing with a shared whiteboard , combined into a single , easy-to-use application. You use a separate \"phone\" tool to place and answer calls. ， The 'inpview' program writes out temporary files in the '/var/tmp' directory. Because these filenames are not random , an attacker can create a symlink to a previously created filename and force the SUID 'inpview' to overwrite the file with 'rw-rw-rw' permissions. ，  * / ， / * copyright LAST STAGE OF DELIRIUM jan 2000 poland *  : //lsd-pl.net/ #  * / ， / * /usr/lib/InPerson/inpview #  * / ， / * sets rw-rw-rw permissions * /",
