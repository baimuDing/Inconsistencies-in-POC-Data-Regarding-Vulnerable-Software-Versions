    "text": "ecve : CVE-2000-0405 ， title : Stake AntiSniff 1.0.1/Researchers 1.0 - DNS Overflow ( 1 ) - Multiple remote Exploit ， verified : Verified ， exploit_detail : // source :  ， Certain versions of @ Stake Inc.'s Antisniffer software contain a remotely exploitable buffer overflow. AntiSniff is a program that was released by L0pht Heavy Industries in July of 1999. It attempts , through a number of tests , to determine if a machine on a local network segment is listening to traffic that is not directed to it ( commonly referred to as sniffing ) . During one particular test there is a problem if a packet that does not adhere to DNS specifications is sent to the AntiSniff machine. This can result in a buffer overflow on the system running AntiSniff. If the packet is crafted appropriately this overflow scenario can be exploited to execute arbitrary code on the system. ， This scenario is only possible if AntiSniff is configured to run the DNS test and only during the time the test is running. Nonetheless , it is a vulnerability that should not be ignored and has even been found in other promiscuous mode detection programs as well. ， NOTE :  ， This information was taken verbatim from the L0pht advisory on the subject. This advisory is attached in full in the 'Credit' section of this advisory. ， / * dnslong.c by Hugo Breton ( bretonh @ pgci.ca )  ， This program must be run in the DNS test phase of Sentinel and Anti Sniff. ， It illustrates how code can be run remotely on a Win98 machine running Anti ， Sniff. ， Suggested arguments are :  ， \"dnslong host 5 65\" to send the Windows 98 version of Anti Sniff in an ， infinite loop. ， \"dnslong host 2 255\" to segfault the oBSD version of Anti Sniff. ， \"dnslong host 1 255\" to segfault Sentinel. ，  * /",
