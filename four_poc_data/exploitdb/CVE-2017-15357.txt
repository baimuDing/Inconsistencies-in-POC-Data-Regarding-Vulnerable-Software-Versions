Unfortunately versions of Arq for mac before 5.9.7 are ，  # vulnerable to a local root privilege escalation exploit. ，  # The updater binary has a \"setpermissions\" function which sets the suid bit and ，  # root ownership on itself but it suffers from a race condition that allows you to ，  # swap the destination for these privileges using a symlink. ，  # We can exploit this to get +s and root ownership on any arbitrary binary. ，  # Other binaries in the application also suffer from the same issue. ，  # This was fixed in Arq 5.9.7. ，  # 49cc82df33a3e23245c7a1659cc74c0e554d5fdbe2547ac14e838338e823956d ，  # ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ ，  #  !
