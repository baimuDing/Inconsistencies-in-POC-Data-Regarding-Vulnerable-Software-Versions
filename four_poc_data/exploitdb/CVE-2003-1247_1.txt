    "text": "ecve : CVE-2003-1247 ， title : H-Sphere WebShell 2.4 - Local Privilege Escalation - Linux local Exploit ， verified : Verified ， exploit_detail : // source :  ， A vulnerability has been discovered in H-Sphere Webshell. During the pre-authentication phase Webshell fails to perform sufficient bounds checking on user-supplied HTTP parameters. As a result , a malicious attacker may be able to trigger a buffer overrun. ， Successful exploitation of this issue would allow an attacker to overwrite the vulnerable function's instruction pointer. By causing the program to return to attacker-supplied instructions , it may be possible to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the target process. ， It should be noted that this issue was discovered in H-Sphere 2.3 RC3. It is not yet known whether earlier versions are also vulnerable. ， / *  ，  * Local r00t exploit for Webshell 2.4 ( possibly other versions ) . ，  * Vulnerability found and exploit written by Carl Livitt ，  *  ( carl (  @  ) learningshophull.co.uk ) . ， Exploits a simple stack-based buffer overflow in CGI.C of the ， HSphere webshell component which is installed SUID & GUID root ， by default. ， Uses a bruteforce method to guess the return address on the stack ， and the amount of data to overflow the buffer with ; this ensures ， it works under many different environments. I originally hardcoded ， these values , but found that this was unreliable. ， Copy this file ( webshell-local.c ) to /tmp and then :  ， cd /tmp ， gcc -o webshell-local webshell-local.c ， cd /path/to/the/webshell/directory ， /tmp/webshell-local ， That should get you r00t without any messing about. ，  * /",
