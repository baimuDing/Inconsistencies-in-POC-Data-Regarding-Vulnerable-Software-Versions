Due to insufficient validation of input , a user can execute arbitrary code through the .nofinger file. ， This makes it possible for a local user to gain elevated privileges , and potentially root access. ， / *  ，  * cfingerd 1.4.3 and prior Linux x86 local root exploit ，  * by qitest1 10/07/2001 ，  * This code successfully exploits the bof vulnerability found by ，  * Steven Van Acker <deepstar @ ulyssis.org> and recently posted to ，  * bugtraq. If the ALLOW_LINE_PARSING option is set , and it is set ，  * by default , the bof simply occurs when reading the ~ /.nofinger ，  * file. If cfingerd is called by inetd as root , a root shell will be ，  * spawned. But it is quite funny that the authors of cfingerd in the ，  * README almost seem to encourage people to set inetd.conf for ，  * calling cfingerd as root. ，  * Greets : my friends on # sikurezza @ Undernet ，  * jtripper : hi man , play_the_game with me ! = )  ，  * warson and warex ，  * Fuck : fender'/hcezar : I want your respect.. ，  * have fun with this 0x69 local toy ! = )  ，  * /",
