The functionality provided by Index Service has been built into Windows 2000 as Indexing Services. ， When combined with IIS , Index Server and Indexing Services include the ability to view web search results in their original context. It will generate an html page showing the query terms in a short excerpt of the surrounding text for each page returned , along with a link to that page. This is known as \"Hit Highlighting\". To do this , it supports the .htw filetype which is handled by the webhits.dll ISAPI application. This dll will allow the use of the '../' directory traversal string in the selection of a template file. This will allow for remote , unauthenticated viewing of any file on the system whose location is known by the attacker. ， The original patch released for this issue still discloses 'include' file types. 'include' files contain various data which assist in the execution of program files. ， / *  ， fredrik.widlund @ defcom-sec.com ， example : iis",
