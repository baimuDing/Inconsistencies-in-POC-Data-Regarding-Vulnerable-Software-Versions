The ability to create hard links to directories is ， wrong implemented and such an issue is affecting os versions greater or ， equal to 10.5. Officially Apple allows you to create hard links only for ， your time machine. <see wiki> Vulnerability CVE-2013-6799 ( incomplete fix ， hard links may be freely high. To create N hard links , you must use a ， special algorithm which creates links from the top of the file system tree. ， This means that first we create the directory structure and once created we ， need to go from up to down by creating hard links. The last time I've ， mentioned of the possibility of a kernel crash by performing the 'ls' ， command. This situation occurs in conjunction with the 'find' application. ， Commands such as 'ls' behave in unexpected ways. Apple are going find this ， crash point in code.
