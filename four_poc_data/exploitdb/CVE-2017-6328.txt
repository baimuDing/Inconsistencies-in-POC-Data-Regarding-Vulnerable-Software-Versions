Description ， The Symantec Messaging Gateway can encounter an issue of cross site request forgery ( also known as one-click attack and is abbreviated as CSRF or XSRF )  , which is a type of malicious exploit of a website where unauthorized commands are transmitted from a user that the web application trusts. A CSRF attack attempts to exploit the trust that a specific website has in a user's browser. ， 2. Proof of concept ， The SMG did not protect the logout form with csrf token , therefore i can logout any user by sending this url ， Here's an attack vector :  ， 1 ) Set up a honeypot that detects SMG scans/attacks ( somehow ) . ， 2 ) Once I get a probe , fire back a logout request. ， 3 ) Continue to logout the active user forever. ， It's less damaging than a traditional \"hack back\" but is sure to irritate the local red team to no end. It's essentially a user DoS. ， 3. Symantec Security Bulletin",
