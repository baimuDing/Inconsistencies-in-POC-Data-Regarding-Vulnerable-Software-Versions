It includes a component named RDS ( Remote Data Services ) . RDS allows remote access via the internet to database objects through IIS. Both are included in a default installation of the Windows NT 4.0 Option Pack , but can be excluded via a custom installation. ， RDS includes a component called the DataFactory object , which has a vulnerability that could allow any web user to :  ， -Obtain unauthorized access to unpublished files on the IIS server ， -Use MDAC to tunnel ODBC requests through to a remote internal or external location , thereby obtaining access to non-public servers or effectively masking the source of an attack on another network. ， The main risk in this vulnerability is the following :  ， -If the Microsoft JET OLE DB Provider or Microsoft DataShape Provider are installed , a user could use the shell (  ) VBA command on the server with System privileges. ( See the Microsoft JET Database Engine VBA Vulnerability for more information ) . These two vulnerabilities combined can allow an attacker on the Internet to run arbitrary commands with System level privileges on the target host. ， msadc.pl exploit written and posted to bugtraq by Rain Forest Puppy. ， -msadc.pl explanation :  ， msadc.pl looks for a common file to exploit , namely btcustmr.mdb . ， msadc.pl instructions :  ， run perl -x msadc.pl ， Command line switches ( copied from rfp's post )  :  ， -h <ip or domain> this is the host to scan. You MUST either ， use either -h or -R. ， -d <value 0-?> this is the delay between connections. ， Value is in number of seconds. I added ， this because hammering the RDS components ， caused the server to occasionally stop ， responding :  ) Defaults to 1. Use -d 0 ， to disable. ， -V Use VbBusObj instead of DataFactory to ， run the queries. NOTE : please read the -N ， information below as to suggestions for ， checking if VbBusObj exists. VbBusObj ， does not give good error reporting ;  ， therefore it is quite possible to have ， false positives ( and false negatives ) . ， Consider VbBusObj support 3 stages before ， beta. Don't say I didn't warn you. ， -v verbose. This will",
