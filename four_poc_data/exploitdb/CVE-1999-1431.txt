Right click on the background of the File : Open window. A prompt will appear that will allow the user to select \"Browse\". Browse will open Windows Explorer. ， Assuming the user has write access to the temp directory , create a special directory in temp and copy in the executables of the forbidden applications to this directory. These applications can now be executed and will circumvent the policies established by ZAK.",
