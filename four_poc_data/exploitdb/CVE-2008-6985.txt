Unfortunately there are multiple SQL Injection issues in Zen Cart that may allow an attacker to execute arbitrary SQL queries on the underlying database. This may allow for an attacker to gather username and password information , among other things. An updated version of Zen Cart has been released to address these issues and users are encouraged to upgrade as soon as possible. ， SQL Injection ， There are a couple of SQL Injection issues within Zen Cart that may allow for a malicious attacker to execute arbitrary SQL queries , and gather arbitrary data from the database. The first issue is due to product attribute values not being properly sanitized ( particularly the value of certain \"id\" parameters ) when adding to or updating the shopping cart. The queries that are vulnerable to SQL injection can either be an update query , or an insert query depending on current shopping cart state and whether or not the customer is logged in. However , Zen Cart installations running with a database that supports sub selects are vulnerable to exploitation. Otherwise the issue is limited in regards to it's ability to be exploited. ， global $ messageStack ;  ， foreach (  $ _POST [ 'products_id' ] as $ key=> $ val ) { ， // while ( list (  $ key ,  $ val ) = each (  $ _POST [ 'products_id' ]  )  ) { ，  $ adjust_max = false ;  ，  $ prodId = $ key ;  ，  $ qty = $ val ;  ，  $ add_max = zen_get_products_quantity_order_max (  $ prodId )  ;  ，  $ cart_qty = $ this->in_cart_mixed (  $ prodId )  ;  ， The above code comes from the actionMultipleAddProduct function in the shopping_cart",
