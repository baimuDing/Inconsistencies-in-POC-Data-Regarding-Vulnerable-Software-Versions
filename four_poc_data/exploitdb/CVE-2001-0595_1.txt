If an overly long KCMS_PROFILES variable is set and kcms_configure is subsequently run , kcms_configure will overflow. Because the kcms_configure binary is setuid root , the overflow allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code as root. ， Exploits are available against Solaris x86 and Solaris Sparc. ，  * / ， / * copyright LAST STAGE OF DELIRIUM dec 1999 poland *  : //lsd-pl.net/ #  * / ， / * kcsSUNWIOsolf.so #  * /",
