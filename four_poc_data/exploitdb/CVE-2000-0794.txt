    "text": "ecve : CVE-2000-0794 ， title : SGI IRIX 6.2 - 'libgl.so' Local Buffer Overflow - IRIX local Exploit ， verified : Verified ， exploit_detail : / *  ， source :  ， Certain versions of IRIX ship with a version libgl.so which is vulnerable to buffer overflow attacks. This library , libgl.so , is used in conjunction with graphical programs which use OpenGL. As a result a number of programs which utilize libgl.so can be exploited via this problem. The exploit which is in known public circulation at this time uses both gmemusage and gr_osview to exploit this problem. The buffer overflow itself is in how libgl.so handles the $ HOME variable is handled ( it is not checked for length ) . Further the programs which receive this $ HOME variable from libgl.so further fail to limit it's size resulting in a buffer overflow attack. Should the receiving programs be SUID root ( as are both gr_osview and gmemusage ) the attacker will gain root access. ，  * / ， / * copyright LAST STAGE OF DELIRIUM sep 1997 poland *  : //lsd-pl.net/ #  * / ， / * libgl.so $ HOME #  * /",
