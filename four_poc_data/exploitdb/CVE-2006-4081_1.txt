The /cgi- ， bin/preview_email.cgi script is designed to retrieve a message from the local ， message database on the Barracuda Spam Firewall. However , the \"file\" parameter which ， is passed via GET is not properly sanitized to restrict the file retrieval to the ， message database directories. The script looks for \"/mail/mlog\" in the file ， parameter but does not take into account directory transversal arguments such as ， \"..\" The result is that any file that is accessible to the web server user is ， accessible from the web interface. The script does require a valid user to be logged ， in to perform this attack , however using the \"Barracuda Hardcoded Password ， Vulnerability\" ( NNL-20060801-01 ) guest password vulnerability this restriction can ， easily be overcome. This particular problem is amplified by the fact that it is ， possible to download the full configuration file for the barracuda. The ， configuration file is periodically backed-up into the /tmp directory as ， \"/tmp/backup/periodic_config.txt.tmp\" Message confidentiality is compromised by the ， fact that an attacker who is able to view the message log screen ( which can be done ， via the guest password vulnerability ) can easily view any message on the system. ， The message logs are stored as /mail/mlog/X/Y/email_address/msgID where X is the ， first character of email_address , Y is the second character of email_address ,  ， email_address is the recipient's email address and msgID is the message ID assigned ， to the message in question. So for example if jon @ smith.com received a message with ， messageID 1234 , any user could view the message by entering ， /mail/mlog/j/o/jon @ smith.com/1234",
