If the MAX_DAYS_IN_TMP variable is set in /etc/rc.config to be larger than 0 , any local user can remove any file on the system. This is due to a flaw in /etc/cron.daily/aaa_base in SuSE 6.3 , or /root/bin/cron.daily in older versions. ， It has been reported that only files in the root directory ( / ) can be removed. Previously , it was thought arbitrary files anywhere on the filesystem could be removed. ， mkdir -p \"/tmp/foo vmlinux\" ， touch -t old-date \"/tmp/foo vmlinux\"",
