The program relies on a number of internal variables. These variables can be overwritten by any remote user by specifying the new value as a variable in the GET request. This is due to the fact that Poll It overwrites variables to user-supplied values after it sets them to the internally-specified defaults. ， This can lead to unauthorized file reads , as well as potentially other compromises. ， http : //target/cgi-bin/pollit/Poll_It_SSI_v2.0.cgi?data_dir=/etc/passwd%00",
