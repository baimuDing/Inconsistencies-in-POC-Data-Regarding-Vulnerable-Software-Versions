    "text": "ecve : CVE-2017-5180 ， title : Firejail < 0.9.44.4 / < 0.9.38.8 LTS - Local Sandbox Escape - Linux local Exploit ， verified : Not Verified ， exploit_detail : / * firejail local root exploit ( host to host )  ，  *  ( C ) 2017 Sebastian Krahmer under the GPL. ，  * WARNING : This exploit uses ld.so.preload technique. ，  * If you are in bad luck , you may end up with an unusable system. ，  * SO BE WARNED. ONLY TEST IT IN YOUR SAFE VM's. ，  * Get the beauty that this is a shared lib and a running ，  * executable at the same time , as we tamper with /etc/ld.so.preload ，  * Therefore you have to compile it like this :  ，  *  $ cc -fPIC -fpic -std=c11 -Wall -pedantic -c firenail.c ，  *  $ gcc -shared -pie firenail.o -o firenail ，  *  $ ./firenail ，  * DO NOT TELL ME THAT SELINUX WOULD HAVE PREVENTED THIS EXPLOIT. ，  * IF I WAS ABOUT TO BYPASS SELINUX ALONG , I WOULD HAVE DONE THE ，  * EXPLOIT DIFFERENTLY. ，  * Analysis : Sandboxing is cool , but it has to be done right. ，  * Firejail has too broad attack surface that allows users ，  * to specify a lot of options , where one of them eventually ，  * broke by accessing user-files while running with euid 0. ，  * There are some other similar races. Turns out that it can be ，  * _very difficult_ to create a generic sandbox suid wrapper thats ，  * secure but still flexible enough to sandbox arbitrary binaries. ，  * Tested with latest commit 699ab75654ad5ab7b48b067a2679c544cc8725f6. ，  * /",
