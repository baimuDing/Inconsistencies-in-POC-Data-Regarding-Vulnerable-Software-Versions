    "text": "ecve : CVE-2001-1185 ， title : FreeBSD 4.4 - AIO Library Cross Process Memory Write - FreeBSD local Exploit ， verified : Verified ， exploit_detail : // source :  ， aio.h is a library implementing the POSIX standard for asynchronous I/O. Support for AIO may be enabled in FreeBSD by compiling the kernel with the VFS_AIO option. This option is not enabled in the default kernel configuration. ， Under some circumstances , pending reads from an input socket may persist through a call to execve. Eventually the read will continue , and write to the memory space of the new process. ， If a local user is able to create and execute a malicious program calling a suid program , it may be possible to overwrite arbitrary memory locations in the suid process with arbitrary data. This could immediately lead to escalated privileges. ， / * tao - FreeBSD Local AIO Exploit ，  * 4.4-STABLE is vulnerable up to at least 28th October. ，  *  ( C ) David Rufino <dr @ soniq.net> 2001 ，  * All Rights Reserved. ，  * bug found 13/07/01 ，  * Any scheduled AIO read/writes will generally persist through an execve. ，  * \"options VFS_AIO\" must be in your kernel config , which is not enabled ，  * by default. ，  * It may be interesting to note that the FreeBSD team have known about this ，  * bug for a long time. Just take a look at 'LINT'. ，  * get the GOT address of exit , from any suid bin , by doing :  ，  *  $ objdump -dynamic-reloc bin | grep exit ，  * /",
