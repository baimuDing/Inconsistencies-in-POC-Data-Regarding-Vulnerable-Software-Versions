A vulnerability in the way KMail creates temporary files to save attachments may allow malicious users to overwrite any file that user running KMail has permissions to. ， When viewing messages with attachments KMail creates a directory under /tmp in which to store the attachments with a predictable name of the form \"kmail<pid of kmail>\". KMail fails to verify whether the directory exists and follows symbolic links. This allows local attackers to create or overwrite files with contents they can select in any directory and/or file writable by the user running KMail. ， / *  ， KDE , kmail local email-attachment symlink exploit - possible root comprimise. ， Discovered/coded by : DiGiT - teddi @ linux.is ， This sploit simply sends an email to somedude @ somehost with an attachment on it ， that contains a fixed 'shadow' file that set's no password for root , change ， that if you need to. ， It then scans /proc for a kmail process and when a kmail process starts it ， will create /tmp/kmail`pidof kmail` and therein the dir part2 and a symlink ， to /etc/shadow. ， Then when root or whatever checks his mail the attachment , get's written over ， /etc/shadow , setting it so that root has no password so u can su - to get root ， privs. ( Note : some probs with this because it writes the contents of 'shadow' ， attachment directly onto the shadow file itself , and might not erase the line ， completly , i'l fix this , later )  ， Run this sploit with nohup or screen or smt. ， Greets ,  # hax ( ircnet !  )  ， special greets , p0rtal ( transmit , etc )  , icemav , cookie , crazy-b. ， ps : Visit haxforce rc5 cracking team !  : > ， ps ps : Besides that fact I am very angry atm , and not very happy with life ,  ， I'd like to note that this kmail crap is UNBELIVABLE buggy and this bug is ， only an example of multiple bugs that exist within kmail code , possible remote ， comprise is also a possibility but , I hate everything so I wont go into that ， atm. ， - DiGiT ，  * /",
