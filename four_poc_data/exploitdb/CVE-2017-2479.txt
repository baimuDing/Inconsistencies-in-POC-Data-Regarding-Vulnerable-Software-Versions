However , if there is a stylesheet that has not been loaded yet , the focusing will be delayed until the stylesheet gets loaded. The problem is that when the link element linked to the last pending stylesheet is removed from the parent , the notifyChildNodeRemoved function may end up to fire a focus event which runs arbitrary JavaScript code , which can make an iframe (  | g | in the PoC ) that has an attached frame but has no parent.",
