The problem lies in the atomicity of placing a target executables file descriptor within the current process descriptor and executing the file. ， An attacker could potentially exploit this vulnerability to gain read access to a setuid binary that would otherwise be unreadable. Although unconfirmed , it may also be possible for an attacker to write code to a target executable , making it theoretically possible to execute arbitrary code with elevated privileges. ，  * / ，  *  *  ，  * Linux 2.4.x suid exec/file read race proof of concept *  ，  * by IhaQueR *  ，  *  * ",
