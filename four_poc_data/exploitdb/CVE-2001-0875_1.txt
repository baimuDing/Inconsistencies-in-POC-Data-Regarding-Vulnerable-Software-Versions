For example : calc.exe ， Description :  ， When your browser cannot locate the URL that you entered in the address bar , you will receive a 404 error message ， telling you that the file was not found. ， This exploit utilizes a custom HTTP 404 error message ( v.exe ) and feeds that eventually to the execCommand Method. ， User input is required because the method always prompts a \"Save HTML Document\" dialog. ， 1. Bypasses the \"File Download - Security Warning\". ， Each time you click a download link , WinXP pops up a \"File Download- Security Warning\" , making you aware that ， Windows is downloading a program and asking for your permission to complete the download process. ， 2. Bypasses the \"Open File - Security Warning\". ， Launching a downloaded executable that originates from an untrusted location ( zone ) such as the Internet also brings ， up a \"Open File - Security Warning\" that asks for permission to install the file in case it's dangerous. ， The execCommand Method :  ， Executes a command on the current document. ， One of the many parameters of this method is the SaveAs Command which saves the current Web page to a local file. ， The SaveAs Command has the following format :  ， document.execCommand ( 'SaveAs' , '1' , 'Name of the webpage.htm' )  ;  ， Platforms Tested :  ，  * Microsoft Windows 2000 Server ，  * Microsoft Windows XP Professional ( IIS V5.1 )  ，  * Internet Explorer Version : 6 ，  * NOT tested on Windows 2003 Server.",
