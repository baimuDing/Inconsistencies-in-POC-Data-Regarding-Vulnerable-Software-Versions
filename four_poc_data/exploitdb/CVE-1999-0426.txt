For this vulnerability to be effective , 3 conditions have to be met : The spoofed machine must be off the network or incapable of sending data out/recieving data properly , the target machine must not be communicating actively with any other machines at the time , and no packets between the attacker's machine and the target can be dropped during the attack. ， The reason this can be done is firstly due to how these kernels handle invalid ack_seq numbers. If a connection has not been established , a packet with an ack_seq too low will be ignored , and a packet with an ack_seq too high will be responded to with a reset packet. If a connection has been established , any invalid ack_seq is ignored. Whether or not a reply packet has been generated can be determined by sending ICMP",
