It is installed setuid root , and is shipped with RedHat Linux 6.0. As it stands , pt_chown is vulnerable to an attack that allows malicious users to write aribtrary data to tty input/output streams ( open file desciptors -> tty ) that don't belong to them ( you could theoretically get full control of the terminal ) . This is done by fooling the program into giving you access ( it lacks security checks ) . Whether you can be compromised or not depends on the software you are using and whether it has support for devpts ( screen , midnight commander , etc ) . The consequences are hijacking of terminals , possibly leading to a root compromise. ， int main ( int a , char * b [  ]  ) { ， char * c=\"\\nclear ; ",
