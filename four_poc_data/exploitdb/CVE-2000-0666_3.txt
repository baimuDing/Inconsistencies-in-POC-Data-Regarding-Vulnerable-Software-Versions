Because of a format-string vulnerability when calling the 'syslog (  ) ' function , a remote attacker can execute code as root. ， The 'rpc.statd' server is an RPC server that implements the Network Status and Monitor RPC protocol. It's a component of the Network File System ( NFS ) architecture. ， The logging code in 'rpc.statd' uses the 'syslog (  ) ' function , passing it as the format string user-supplied data. A malicious user can construct a format string that injects executable code into the process address space and overwrites a function's return address , thus forcing the program to execute the code. ， The 'rpc.statd' server requires root privileges for opening its network socket , but fails to drop these privileges later on. Therefore , code run by the malicious user will execute with root privileges. ， Debian , Red Hat , and Connectiva have all released advisories. Presumably , any Linux distribution that runs the statd process is vulnerable unless patched for the problem. ， statdx ， Redhat Linux 6.0/6.1/6.2 rpc.statd remote root exploit ( IA32 )  ， by ron1n <shellcode @ hotmail.com> ， August 3 , 2000 ， Sydney , Australia ， Oh you prob'ly won't remember me ， It's prob'ly ancient history ， I'm one of the chosen few ， Who went ahead and fell for you ，  $ gcc -o statdx statdx.c ; ./statdx -h ， Thanks to smiler for the format string vulnerability clarification. ， background info ， rpc.statd is an ONC RPC server that implements the Network Status ， Monitor RPC protocol to provide reboot notification. It is used by ， the NFS file locking service ( rpc.lockd ) when it performs lock ， recovery. ， Due to a format string vulnerability in a call to syslog (  ) within ， its logging module , rpc.statd can be exploited remotely by script ， kids bent on breaking into your Redhat Linux box and defacing your ， website with crackpot political musings. ， This is not a traditional buffer overflow vulnerability.
