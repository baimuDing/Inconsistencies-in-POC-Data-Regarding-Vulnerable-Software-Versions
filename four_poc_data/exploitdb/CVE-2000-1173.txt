Installation of a sniffer has shown that all information with the exception of the credit card number is actually sent in clear text to Microsys. A remote attacker could place a sniffer upstream from the sending client and gather confidential registration information in addition to the credit card number which is only protected by a substitution cypher ( please see the original bugtraq message in the reference section for details on the cypher ) . Additionally , this information could be obtained by examining the log files of a proxy firewall. ，  #  ! /usr/bin/perl ，  $ showline=0 ;  ， open ( SNORT , \"log\" )  ;  ， LINE : while (  $ line=<SNORT> ) { ，  @ field=split /\\s/ ,  $ line ;  ，  $ registerinfo= ~ s/\\%20/ /g ;  ，  $ registerinfo= ~ s/\\%40/ @ /g ;  ，  (  $ junk ,  $ registerinfo ) =split /\\.\\.\\.\\./ ,  $ registerinfo ;  ，  @ array=split /\\&/ ,  $ registerinfo ; ",
