    "text": "ecve : CVE-2001-0706 ， title : Rumpus FTP Server 1.3.x/2.0.3 - Stack Overflow Denial of Service - OSX dos Exploit ， verified : Verified ， exploit_detail : source :  ， Rumpus FTP Server is an implementation for MacOS which allows file-sharing across TCP/IP connections. ， Rumpus FTP is prone to a denial of service. An ftp user can engage the attack by making a directory with an unusual number of sub-folders. This forces the software to quit , as it is unable to handle the creation of so many directories at one time. The FTP server must be rebooted to regain normal functionality. ， It is required that a user be logged in to carry out this attack. It may be possible for remote users to exploit this vulnerability , but authentication is required and anonymous ftp access does not grant users the privileges neccesary to create directories. ， Executing command 'mkdir A : A : A : A : A : A : A : A : A : A : A : A : A : A : A : A : A : A : A : A' will make Rumpus quit.",
