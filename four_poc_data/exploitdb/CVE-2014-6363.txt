    "text": "ecve : CVE-2014-6363 ， title : Microsoft Internet Explorer 8/9/10/11 / IIS / CScript.exe/WScript.exe VBScript - CRegExp..Execute Use of Uninitialized Memory ( MS14-080/MS14-084 ) - Windows remote Exploit ， verified : Verified ， exploit_detail : < ! -- ， Source :  ， Synopsis ， A specially crafted script can cause the VBScript engine to access data before initializing it. An attacker that is able to run such a script in any application that embeds the VBScript engine may be able to control execution flow and execute arbitrary code. This includes all versions of Microsoft Internet Explorer. ， Known affected versions , attack vectors and mitigations ， vbscript.dll ， The issue affects versions 5.6 through 5.8 and both the 32- and 64-bit vbscript.dll binaries. ， Windows Script Host ， VBScript can be executed in the command line using cscript.exe/wscript.exe. An attacker would need to find a script running on a target machine that accepts an attacker supplied regular expression and a string , or be able to execute his/her own script. However , since the later should already provide an attacker with arbitrary code execution , no additional privileges are gained by exploiting this vuln. ， Microsoft Internet Explorer ， VBScript can be executed from a web-page ; MSIE 8 , 9 , 10 and 11 were tested and are all affected. MSIE 11 requires a META tag to force it to render the page as an earlier version , as MSIE 11 attempts to deprecate vbscript ( but fails , so why bother? ) . An attacker would need to get a target user to open a specially crafted web-page. Disabling scripting , particularly VBScript , should prevent an attacker from triggering the vulnerable code path. Enabling Enhanced Protected Mode appears to disable VBScript on my systems , but I have been unable to find documentation on-line that confirms this is by design. ， Internet Information Server ( IIS )  ， If Active Server Pages ( ASP ) are enabled , VBScript can be executed in Active Server Pages. An attacker would need to find an asp page that accepts an attacker supplied regular expression and a string , or be able to inject VBScript into an ASP page in order to trigger the vulnerability. ， Repro ， Below are three repro files that trigger the issue in Windows Script Host ( repro.vbs )  , Microsoft Internet Explorer ( repro.html )  , and Internet Information Server ( repro.asp ) . ， Repro.vbs :  ， Set oRegExp = New RegExp ， oRegExp.Pattern = \"A |  (  )  * ? $ \" ， oRegExp.Global = True ， oRegExp.Execute ( String ( &H11 , \"A\" ) & \"x\" )  ， Repro.html : ",
