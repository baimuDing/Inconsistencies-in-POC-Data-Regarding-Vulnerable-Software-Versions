    "text": "ecve : CVE-2004-2303 ， title : MTools 3.9.x - 'MFormat' Local Privilege Escalation - Linux local Exploit ， verified : Verified ， exploit_detail : source :  ， It has been reported that mformat is prone to a privilege escalation vulnerability when installed as a setUID application. This issue is due to a design error allowing a user to create any arbitrary files as the root user. ， A local attacker could exploit this issue by forcing the creation of sensitive system files that already exist. When the application formats the specified files , the target system file will be overwritten , destroying sensitive system data. Since the files that are given permissions 0666 and owned by root , the attacker may alter overwritten system configuration files , allowing for a escalation of privileges. ，  #  ! /usr/bin/perl ，  # mtools/mformat <= 3.9.9 local root exploit. ，  # Successfully tested on a Mandrake 9.2 default install. ，  #  ( C ) 2004 krahmer @ cs.uni-potsdam.de.",
