The POP3 commands \"list\" , \"retr\" .uidl\" and \"user\" and the SMTP command \"vrfy\" , if sent with abnormally long arguments , will crash the server. These limits seem to be around 200 characters for the POP3 commands , and around 250 characters for the SMTP command. ， // Currently , these problems have only been reliably remotely exploited as DoS attacks , however , it is conceivable that a remote shell exploit could be created. ， // iamexploit.c - by Arne Vidstrom - ， // This exploit code starts the Command Prompt on a remote computer ， // running Internet Anywhere Mail Server version 2.3.1 , build 10020. ， // However , it is very dependent on different DLL versions installed ， // on the server computer. This code exploits a vrfy buffer overflow ， // in the SMTP part of the mail server.",
