    "text": "ecve : CVE-1999-0070 ， title : Apache 0.8.x/1.0.x / NCSA HTTPd 1.x - 'test-cgi' Directory Listing - CGI remote Exploit ， verified : Verified ， exploit_detail : source :  ， NCSA HTTPd and comes with a CGI sample shell script , test-cgi , located by default in /cgi-bin. This script does not properly enclose an \"ECHO\" command in quotes , and as a result \"shell expansion\" of the * character can occur under some configurations. This allows a remote attacker to obtain file listings , by passing *  , / *  , /usr/ * etc. , as variables. The ECHO command expands the * to give a directory listing of the specified directory. This could be used to gain information to facilitate future attacks. This is identical to a problem with another sample script , nph-test-cgi. See references.",
