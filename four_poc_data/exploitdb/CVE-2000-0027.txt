    "text": "ecve : CVE-2000-0027 ， title : IBM Network Station Manager 2.0 R1 - Race Condition - Unix local Exploit ， verified : Verified ， exploit_detail : // source :  ， IBM's Network Station Manager is a client/server application which facilitates management for IBM Network Stations. It is possible to locally gain root priviliges on hosts running the NetStation daemon. NetStation ( which runs as root ) creates temporary files in /tmp with predictable filenames based on a known partial filename and the current system time , creating a race condition which can lead to root compromise if the race is won. A symlink would have to be created with a correct predicted filename that points to ( for example ) /.rhosts , causing NetStation to write to it. The attacker would then add \"+ +\" to the file , chown root it and rlogin ( or rsh in ) as root.",
