It is a stack-based overflow which may allow for attackers to overwrite stack variables and execute arbitrary code on the underlying host. ， The webserver minimizes the risk of root compromise by dropping privileges after it has bound to port 80. This vulnerability is still a serious threat however , as remote attackers can gain access. ， / * PRPghttpd.c ， This program is free software ; you can redistribute it and/or ， modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License ， as published by the Free Software Foundation ; either version 2 ， of the License , or ( at your option ) any later version. ， This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful ,  ， but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY ; without even the implied warranty of ， MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
