    "text": "ecve : CVE-2003-1336 ， title : mIRC 6.1 - 'IRC' Protocol Remote Buffer Overflow - Windows remote Exploit ， verified : Verified ， exploit_detail : / remote mirc < 6.11 exploit by blasty ， TESTED ON : Windows XP ( No SP , Ducth ) Build : 2600.xpclient.010817-1148 ， A few days ago , I saw a mIRC advisory on packetstorm [ 1 ] and was surprised ， nobody had written an exploit yet. So I decided to start writing one. ， Since this was my first time coding a exploit for windows , it took some ， research before I got the hang of it. ( Ollydbg is much more confusing then GDB btw : P )  ， This exploits ( ab ) uses the bug in irc : // URI handling. It contains a buffer- ， overflow , and when more then 998 bytes are given EIP will be overwritten. ， At first I was thinking of a simple solution to get this exploitable. Since ， giving an URI with > 998 chars to someone on IRC is simply NOT done :  )  ， Then I remember the iframe-irc : // flaw found by uuuppzz [ 2 ]  ， This exploit will write an malicious HTML file containing an iframe executing the ， irc : // address. So you can give this to anyone on IRC for example ;  )  ， The shellcode included does only execute cmd.exe , because I don't want to be this ， a scriptkiddy util. But , replacing the shellcode with your own is also possible. ， An 400 bytes shellcode ( bindshell etc. ) easily fits in the buffer , but it may require ， some tweaking. ， After exiting the cmd.exe mIRC will crash , so shellcode its not 100% clean , but who carez :  )  ， Oh yeah , I almost forgot.. this exploit also works even if mIRC isn't started. ， mIRC will start automatically when an irc : // is executed , so you can also send somebody ， and HTML email containing the evil HTML code. ( only for poor clients like Outlook Express : P ) ",
