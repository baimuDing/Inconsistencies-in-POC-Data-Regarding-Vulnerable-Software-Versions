Such information could be sold by the attacker to other malicious individuals , used in other attacks ( as the same password is often used across systems ) or released publicly to damage the organisations reputation. ， - Modify content within the application. If this was possible , the attacker could add malicious code to the application , which could then be used to deliver malware or exploit issues within client browsers. ， In this particular instance , exploitation was more difficult as the results of the attack had to inferred based on the pages returned , often referred to as blind SQL Injection. This does not prevent exploitation , it simply means that the methods required to perform this attack require a very large number of requests to be made. However , because of this it is potentially easier to identify that an attack using this method is being attempted.",
