When an attempt to connect to the router is made using the administrative software , the router sends the password to the client in plain text. This packet is sent via UDP. ， The vendor has released firmware version 6.0.27 , dated July 2002. Reports suggest that this firmware does not adequately protect against this vulnerability. The firmware is reported to use an encrypted UDP packet when connecting to the router. However , the firmware uses a weak encryption scheme and thus it is easily circumvented by an attacker. ， this is a really-stupid bad-written exploit for telindus router ( 10xx and ， 11xx series )  ， bye ,  ， rubik @ olografix.org ， / * telozarzo.c * /",
