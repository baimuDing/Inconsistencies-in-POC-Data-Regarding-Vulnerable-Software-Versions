In other words ,  ，  * port 80 TCP and port 7 UDP have to be open. The exploitation will take a ，  * very long time since the overflow is triggered by sending 2 Gigabytes of ，  * data to the device. Depending on your connection to the target , this may ，  * take up to several DAYS. ，  * Shellcodes :  ，  * o In case a 1600 running 11.3 ( 11b ) IP only is detected , a runtime IOS ，  * patching shellcode is used. After that , the device will no longer ，  * validate VTY and enable access passwords. Mission accomplished. ，  * o In case of any other 11.x IOS or in case it runs from flash where ，  * code patching is more complicated , the shellcode will replace all ，  * passwords in the config with \"phenoelit\" and reboot the box. Change ，  * the passwords in the shellcodes if you like. ，  * --- ，  * FX of Phenoelit <fx at phenoelit.de> ，  * /",
