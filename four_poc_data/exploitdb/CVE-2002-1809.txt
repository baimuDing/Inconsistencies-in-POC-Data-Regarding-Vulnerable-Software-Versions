Reportedly , the root user of the database is defined with no password , and granted login privileges from any host. ， This issue has been reported in the Windows binary release of MySQL. Other versions may share this default configuration , this has not however been confirmed. ，  * / ， //mysqlfuck.c ， / * -- | MySQLfuck | -- * / ， / * Written by g0thm0g * / ， / * ----------------- * / ， / * Earlier this summer ( at least where I live )  , I had a ， conversation with a friend. ， It was one of those afternoons where you get an idea ,  ， and it kinda sticks with you. ， Anyway , our conversation involved a couple questions ， about INSERT's into a MySQL ， database. Eventually , I told him that I would do it ， on his computer , and accidentally typed his full IP ， address in. TO my surprise , the ， host still connected. Even worse , root login wasn't ， passworded. I figured that he ， had mysql bound to 127.0.0.1 , and that no real remote ， host could connect. However ,  ， later that night after I had gone home , I got a phone ， call from the friend asking me ， to do it again. Already on the computer ( go figure ， d :  )  , I pulled up bash and ， typed in his IP. Right as I was about to ask him what ， his password was , I noticed ， that MySQL hadn't even bothered to authenticate me. I ， \"used mysql\" and then SELECT'ed ， user , password , host FROM user. To my horror , I recieved :  ， +------+----------+-----------+ ，  | user | password | host |  ， +------+----------+-----------+ ，  | root |  | localhost |  ，  | root |  | % |  ，  |  |  | localhost |  ，  |  |  | % |  ， +------+----------+-----------+ ， Not only was name-less login allowed , but root was ， without password on localhost ， and remote. Anyway , to make a long story short , I did ， some research , and found that ， default Windows MySQL configuration lacks logging or ， authentication. I did some ， network scanning , and I think I have around 400 hosts ， with no root password. Anyway ,  ， to automate checking this , I wrote this program up. It ， tries to login as root/NULL ,  ， then takes the values of the user password hashes and ， tries to find a match to a ， dictionary file called dictionary.txt. ， I wrote up an advisory , which you'll probably see on ， SecFoc soon. ， If I had some cookies , I'd give them to :  ， -Tiefer and his relentless questioning and jokes about ， my sister ， -Club 21 , especially for Hard Attack ， -DJ Doboy , can't forget trancequility volume 19 ，  ( INSERT STANDARD \"NOT-TO-BE-USED-FOR-ILLEGAL-USE\" ， CLAUSE HERE )  ，  ( INSERT STANDARD \"I-HOLD-NO-LIABILITY\" CLAUSE HERE )  ， Compile :  ， -MSVC= cl mysqlfuck.c libmySQL.lib /DWIN32 -O2 ， -GCC= gcc -omysqlfuck mysqlfuck.c -lmySQL -O2 ， -Cheers ， g0th ，  * /",
