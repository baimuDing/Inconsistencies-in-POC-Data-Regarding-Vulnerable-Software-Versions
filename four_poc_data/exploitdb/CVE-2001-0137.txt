Skins for Windows Media Player are installed to a known location : \"C : /Program files/Windows Media Player/Skins/skin.wmz\". ， As a result , a remote HTML document , visited by the victim user , can lead the user's browser to download an arbitrary file matching the the name 'skin.wmz' to this known location. ， A malicious remote user could exploit this to upload a file containing executable java code disguised as a Windows Media Player skin file. ， An applet tag in the remote HTML document can then execute the 'skin.wmz' file as Java code. Properly exploited , this could provide an attacker with complete control of the vulnerable system. On multiuser Windows NT or 2000 systems , this vulnerability can only provide the attacker with access to the system that is within the security context of the user who was exploited. ， <HTML> ， <HEAD> ， <TITLE> ， Windows Media Player 7 and IE java vulnerability - executing arbitrary programs ， </TITLE> ， </HEAD> ， <BODY> ， <H3> ， Windows Media Player 7 and IE java vulnerability - executing arbitrary programs ， </H3> ， <BR> ， <p>Legal Notice :  ， <br>This Advisory and Demonstration is Copyright ( c ) 2000 Georgi Guninski.
