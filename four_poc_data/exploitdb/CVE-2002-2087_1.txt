It is available for Unix and Linux operating systems. As Firebird is based on Borland/Inprise Interbase source code , it is very likely that Interbase is prone to this issue also. ， A buffer overflow has been discovered in the setuid root program gds_inet_server , packaged with Firebird. This problem could allow a local user to execute the program with strings of arbitrary length. By using a custom crafted string , the attacker could overwrite stack memory , including the return address of a function , and potentially execute arbitrary code as root. ， / * DSR-olbird.c by bob @ dtors.net ， Same exploit as DSR-firebird.c apart from this version ， exploits Firebird 1.0.0 which is shipped with freebsd. ，  [ diif ] ret addr LEN [ /diif ]  ， bob @ dtors.net ，  * /",
