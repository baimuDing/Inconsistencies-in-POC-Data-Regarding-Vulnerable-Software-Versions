    "text": "ecve : CVE-2000-0338 ， title : CVS 1.10.7 - Local Denial of Service - Linux dos Exploit ， verified : Verified ， exploit_detail : source :  ， CVS stands for Concurrent Versions Software and is an open-source package designed to allow multiple developers to work concurrently on a single source tree , recording changes and controlling versions. It is possible to cause a denial of service for users of CVS due to predictable temporary filenames. CVS uses locking directories in /tmp and combines the static string 'cvs-serv' with the process ID to use as filenames. This is trivial to guess for an attacker , and since /tmp is world writeable , directories can be created with predicted names. CVS drops root priviliges , so these directories cannot be overwritten and every session for which a locking directory has been already created ( by the attacker ) will be broken. ， The following perl script will create many directories in /tmp with incrementing pids :  ，  #  ! /usr/bin/perl ，  $ min=400 ;  ，  $ max=4000 ;  ， open CVSTMP , \"/tmp/cvs-serv $ x\" or die \"/tmp/cvs-serv $ x :  $  ! \" ;  ， chmod 0600 , \"/tmp/cvs-serv $ x\" ;  ， close CVSTMP ; ",
