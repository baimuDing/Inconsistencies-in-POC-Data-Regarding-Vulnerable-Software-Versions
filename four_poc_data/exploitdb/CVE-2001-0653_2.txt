    "text": "ecve : CVE-2001-0653 ， title : Sendmail 8.11/8.12 Debugger - Arbitrary Code Execution ( 2 ) - Linux local Exploit ， verified : Verified ， exploit_detail : // source :  ， An input validation error exists in Sendmail's debugging functionality. ， The problem is the result of the use of signed integers in the program's tTflag (  ) function , which is responsible for processing arguments supplied from the command line with the '-d' switch and writing the values to it's internal \"trace vector.\" The vulnerability exists because it is possible to cause a signed integer overflow by supplying a large numeric value for the 'category' part of the debugger arguments. The numeric value is used as an index for the trace vector , and can therefore be used to write within a certain range of proces memory if a negative value is given. ， Because the '-d' command-line switch is processed before the program drops its elevated privileges , this could lead to a full system compromise. This vulnerability has been successfully exploited in a laboratory environment. ， / *  ，  * sendmail 8.11.x exploit ( i386-Linux ) by sd @ sf.cz ( sd @ ircnet )  ，  * fixed by Marcin Bukowski <insect @ insect.hack.pl> ，  * <insect> I'll change , and fix this code requested by friend ，  * for him ，  * -d specify depth of analysis ( 32 )  [ bigger = more time ]  ，  * -o change offset ( -32000 )  [ between 1000..-64000 ]  ，  * -v specify victim ( /usr/sbin/sendmail )  [ suided binary ]  ，  * -t specify temp directory ( /tmp/.s11x )  ，  * simply try to run an exploit without parameters ，  * --------------------------------------------------------------- ，  * /",
