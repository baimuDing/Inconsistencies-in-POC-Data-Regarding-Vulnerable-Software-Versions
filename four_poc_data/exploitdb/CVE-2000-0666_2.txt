Because of a format-string vulnerability when calling the 'syslog (  ) ' function , a remote attacker can execute code as root. ， The 'rpc.statd' server is an RPC server that implements the Network Status and Monitor RPC protocol. It's a component of the Network File System ( NFS ) architecture. ， The logging code in 'rpc.statd' uses the 'syslog (  ) ' function , passing it as the format string user-supplied data. A malicious user can construct a format string that injects executable code into the process address space and overwrites a function's return address , thus forcing the program to execute the code. ， The 'rpc.statd' server requires root privileges for opening its network socket , but fails to drop these privileges later on. Therefore , code run by the malicious user will execute with root privileges. ， Debian , Red Hat , and Connectiva have all released advisories. Presumably , any Linux distribution that runs the statd process is vulnerable unless patched for the problem. ， / *  ，  * rpc.statd remote root xploit for linux/x86 ，  * based on the xploit made by drow for linux/PowerPC ，  * Author : Doing , 08/2000 ，  * NOTE :  ，  * The guest of the remote address of the saved EIP and local vars ，  * is still a problem. The value showed on the usage worked ，  * fine on mi suse with the compiled sources. With gdb and a little ，  * patience you should get the address for your distro/version. ，  * Some address doesn't work , because they cause a very long result ,  ，  * and the syslog (  ) function overflows itself when parsing the ，  * format input :  ( ",
