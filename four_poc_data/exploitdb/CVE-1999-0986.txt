An easy way to generate such packet is by using the command \"ping -s 65468 -R ANYADDRESS\". The -R option is for the IP record route option. Under kernel versions 2.2.X the command will fail with an message of \"message too long\". ， The vulnerability seems to be the result of the kernel not checking aif packet with options is longer than the maximum packet size. A long packet seems to lead to memory corruption. ，  * / ， / * Exploit option length missing checks in Linux-2.0.38 ， Andrea Arcangeli <andrea @ suse.de> * /",
