    "text": "ecve : CVE-2001-0136 ， title : ProFTPd 1.2 - 'SIZE' Remote Denial of Service - Linux dos Exploit ， verified : Verified ， exploit_detail : source :  ， A memory leak has been reported in all versions of ProFTPd. ， The SIZE FTP command causes the server to misallocate and leak small amounts of memory each time the command is executed. ， If a sufficient number of these commands are executed by the server , substantial amounts of system memory can be consumed , allowing a remote attacker to carry out a denial of service attack on the affected host. ， This could be problematic if anonymous FTP is enabled or if a malicious local user has been supplied with an FTP login ID. ， / * ProFTPd DoS version 1.1 ， Remote DoS in proFTPd ， Code by : JeT-Li -The Wushu Master- jet_li_man @ yahoo.com ， Recently I posted a remote DoS for ProFTPd based in the multiple use ， of the SIZE command in order to crash the system. Now and thanks to ， the information provided by Wojciech Purczynski I have coded a ， program that not only use the SIZE command but also the USER command. ， So at this time access to the ftp is not necessary to manage a DoS ， attack. The concept is equal to the last exploit one , but using ， multiple USER instead of SIZE. ， You don't have to give arguments when you execute the program , it ， will request you these. ， Greets : _kiss_ ( the real fucker ; -P )  ; gordoc ( no comment , the most ， hax man in the w0rld )  ; Perip | o ( tibetan mantras for u !  ; -P )  ; and all ， the ppl of # hackers ( not able for cardiac XD ) . ， Vulnerable systems :  ， ProFTPd 1.2.0rc1 ( Tested )  ， ProFTPd 1.2.0rc2 ( Tested )  ， And maybe others ( 1.2.0preX )  ; I have no test this , but I'm sure you ， can do it for me ; - )  ， NOTE : 1.2.0pre10 is seems to be vulnerable according to the words of ， Wojciech Purczynski ... * /",
