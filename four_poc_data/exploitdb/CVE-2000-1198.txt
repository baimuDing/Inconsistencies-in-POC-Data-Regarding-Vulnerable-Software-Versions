Affected include Qualcomm's qpopper , and the popd included as part of the imap-4 rpm from RedHat. Lockfiles in both implementation are created with consistent local file names ; the RedHat popd in /tmp , with a fairly random name ( albeit consistent for a given user )  , and in the mail spool directory , with the user name prepended by a \".\" and appended with \".pop\". Creation of either of these files will prevent the popd user from being able to establish a connection to retrieve their mail. ， The FreeBSD port of imap-uw contains this vulnerability. It is not , however , included as a standard part of a FreeBSD install. ， touch /var/mail/.username.pop",
