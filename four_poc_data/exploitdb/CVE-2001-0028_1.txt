    "text": "ecve : CVE-2001-0028 ， title : Oops Proxy Server 1.4.22 - Remote Buffer Overflow ( 1 ) - Unix remote Exploit ， verified : Verified ， exploit_detail : // source :  ， Oops is a freely available proxy server package , written by Igor Khasilev. A problem exists in the package which could allow for the arbitrary execution of code. ， Multiple buffer overflows exist in this product. In one instance , it is possible to make a request with numerous quotation marks ( \" ) in the request , which are later translated to the html tag \"&quot ; \". The translation of this character makes it possible to overflow and potentially execute code on the stack. This makes it possible for a malicious user to execute code with the privileges of the user the proxy server is operating as. ， The secondary problem involves a buffer overflow in the DNS resolution code. It is possible to create a stack based overflow by forcing the proxy to attempt to resolve a long host/domain name. This makes it possible to overwrite variables on the stack , and potentially execute arbitrary code. It is possible for a malicious user to exploit this problem and execute commands with the privileges inherited by the proxy server process. ， / * Dimostrative Exploit Against Oops Proxy Server v 1.4.22 and prior ，  * Coded by | CyRaX | <cyrax @ pkcrew.org> ，  * Packet Knights Crew : www.pkcrew.org",
