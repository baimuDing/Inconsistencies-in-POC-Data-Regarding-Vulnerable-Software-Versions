Many of these ， vulnerabilities affect X3 in the same manner , without needing to use a ， SOAP API. ， Vulnerability- ， When UPnP services and WAN http administrative access are enabled ,  ， authorization and credential challenges can be bypassed by directly ， accessing root privileged abilities via a web browser URL. ， All aspects of the modem/router can be changed , altered and controlled ， by an attacker , including gaining access to and changing the PPPoe/PPP ， ISP credentials. ， Timeline with Vendor- ， Have had no response from Zoom Telephonics since first reporting the ， problem on June 28. Subsequent emails have been sent with no response. ， Root Cause Observed- ， -As in most IGD UPnP routers and modems , where root vulnerabilities ， are prevalent , these modems contain the same privileged tunnel between ， either side of the router to be traversed without authentication. The ， code and layout of the device plays a large role as well. ， Code/Script Vulnerabilities- ， -Form tags and actions ids usually hidden are easily seen from the ， html source , no sanitization of client side input is occurring and ， root overrides such as 'Zadv=1' can be invoked by any user. ， -No cookie authentication is done once several of the first bypass is ， executed , allowing for \"Cookie : sessionId=invalid\" to pass admin commands. ， -The SQL injection UNION SELECT 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7- added to the end of ， any URL page calling a table value , such as /MainPage?id=25 , will ， bring up the system status page , with each interface visible and ， selectable. ， Patches or Fixes- ， At this time , there are no known patches or fixes. ， Vulnerability proofs and examples- ， All administrative items can be accessed through these two URLs ， -Menu Banner ， -Advanced Options Menu ， Example commands that can be executed remotely through a web browser ， URL , or a modified HTTP GET/POST requests- ， -Change Password for admin Account ， On Firmware 2.5 or lower ， On Firmware 3.0- ， -Clear Logs ， -Remote Reboot to Default Factory Settings- ， Warning - For all intents and purposes , this action will almost always ， result in a long term Denial of Service attack. ， -Create New Admin or Intermediate Account- ， On Firmware 2.5 or lower ， On Firmware 3.0- ， Mitigation and Workarounds- ， Adv.Options --> UPnP --> --> Disable UPnP --> Write Settings to Flash --> Reboot ， Adv.Options --> Firewall Configuration --> Enable 'Attack Protection' ， 'DOS Proctection''Black List'--> Write Settings to Flash ， Adv.Options --> Management Control --> Disable WAN Management from all ， fields --> Write Settings to Flash ， Always change the default Username and Password , though this will ， nothelp mitigate this vulnerability",
