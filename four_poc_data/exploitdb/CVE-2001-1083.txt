Upon receiving a request from a user for a file that ends with a slash or period , the server will crash. The behaviour occurs when the remote attacker adds an '/' , '\\' or '.' to the end the URL they craft to request the file. The request of an existing file is not necessary , as the Icecast server will fail regardless. ， NOTE : File is interpreted by Icecast as the 'root' directory and anything after 'file/' indicates the file request. The character '/' triggers the denial of service.",
