    "text": "ecve : CVE-2003-0332 ， title : Working Resources BadBlue 1.7.x/2.x - Unauthorized HTS Access - Windows remote Exploit ， verified : Verified ， exploit_detail : source :  ， BadBlue is prone to a vulnerability that could allow remote attackers to gain unauthorized access to administrative functions. ， It is possible to bypass BadBlue security checks when '.hts' files are requested by a remote user. BadBlue restricts access to non-HTML files by replacing the first two letters in the file extension of a requested resource with 'ht'. If the third character of a file extension is 's' , then it is possible to trick BadBlue into serving a non-HTML file with an extension of '.hts'. This will bypass other security checks which would normally prevent BadBlue from serving these files to remote users. ， This example will reveal the contents of the server's primary volume.",
