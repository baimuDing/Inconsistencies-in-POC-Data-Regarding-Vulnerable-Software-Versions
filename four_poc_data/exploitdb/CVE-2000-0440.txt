By sending a packet to a machine running the Alpha or SPARC versions of NetBSD , with an unaligned IP timestamp option , it is possible to cause the kernel to perform an unaligned memory access. This will cause a panic , causing the machine to reboot. ， x86 and arm32 platforms have a similar bug. However , as both of these architectures can perform unaligned memory accesses , this vulnerability does not cause them to panic. ， It was later determined that FreeBSD , a 4.xBSD derivative like NetBSD , is also vulnerable to this problem.",
