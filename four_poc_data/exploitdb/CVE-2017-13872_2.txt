Anyone can login as \"root\" with empty password after clicking on login button several times. Are you aware of it @ Apple?\" ， Proof :  ， Mitigation/Detection/Forensic :  ， - Can be mitigated by enabling the root user with a strong password ， - Can be detected with `osquery` using `SELECT * FROM plist WHERE path = \"/private/var/db/dslocal/nodes/Default/users/root.plist\" AND key = \"passwd\" AND length ( value ) > 1 ; \" ; ` ， - You can see what time the root account was enabled using `SELECT * FROM plist WHERE path = \"/private/var/db/dslocal/nodes/Default/users/root.plist\" WHERE key = \"accountPolicyData\" ; ` then base 64 decoding that into a file and then running `plutil -convert xml1` and looking at the `passwordLastSetTime` field. ， _Note : osquery needs to be running with `sudo` but if you have it deployed across a fleet of macs as a daemon then it will be running with `sudo` anyway._ ， _Note : You can get the same info with plutil ( 1 )  : ` $ sudo plutil -p /private/var/db/dslocal/nodes/Default/users/root.plist`_ ， Security Advisory : ",
