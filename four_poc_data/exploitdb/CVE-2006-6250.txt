It can even cause ， a huge spike in CPU Resources , a few times mine flatlined at 99% after exploit ， and required a system reboot. ， I don't have the time to try to turn this into an exploit , but i've seen ， it overwrite EIP with some values - the string is getting converted to unicode ， prior to the error. And sometimes EIP gets randomly overwritten with values ,  ， and sometimes the application just crashes. ， For me using this exploit EIP gets overwritten with 0x35382534 = \"58%4\" ， sometimes its 0x3f3f3f3f and sometimes its 0xfffffff3. ， I noticed removing a file extension from the exploit causes EIP to get ， overwriten ， more frequently. ， Im sure someone will turn this into an exploit , just credit me with my name and ， email address in the exploit , I'll be more than happy. ， Happy Hunting and Happy Holidays to everyone ， <insert super awesome leet ascii art here> ， November 2006 - Month Of Greg's Media Player Exploits :  )  ，  ( i'll probably continue it into December )  ， Discovered and Reported By : Greg Linares GLinares.code @ gmail.com ， Reported Exploit Date : 11/28/2006 ，  * /",
