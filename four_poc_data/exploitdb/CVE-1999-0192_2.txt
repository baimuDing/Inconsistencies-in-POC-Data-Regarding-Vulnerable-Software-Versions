Versions of libtermcap 2.0.8 and earliear are vulnerable. ， Under Red Hat Linux 5.2 and 4.2 , this could lead to local users gaining root privileges , as xterm ( as well as other possibly setuid programs ) are linked against libtermcap. Under Red Hat Linux 6.0 , xterm is not setuid root. ， Debian and Caldera OpenLinux use the ncurses library instead of termcap and thus are not vulnerable. ， / * Local exploit for suid root programs linked to libtermcap < 2.0.8-15 ，  * tested with xterm and nxterm on RedHat 5.2 and 4.2 ，  * sk8 @ lucid-solutions.com ，  * Usage :  ，  * ./smashcap -default is buffer size of 4210 and offset of 300 ，  * and seems to work on RH 5.2 ，  * Adjust offsets ( somewhere between 230 - 1140 ) if necessary ，  * ./smashcap <offset> -buffer size defaults to 4210 ，  * ./smashcap <offset> <buffersize> ，  * In order to stop script kids/opportunists , one MINOR change must be ，  * made in order for this to work. ，  * Use only to test your machines to show you that you must patch libtermcap. ，  * Quick fix , chmod u-s ALL suid root programs linked with libtermcap. ，  * - sk8 of LS ，  * /",
