The exploit was tested on windows 2000 server SP4 in a ，  # Vmware environment. At the time of overflow EBX points to our shellcode. ，  # However this buffer into which EBX points will give a maximum of 224 bytes of ，  # uninterrupted space for shellcode. So for my analysis is settled for a useradd ，  # shellcode which comes to 224 bytes : - ) . However looking at it a little bit ，  # further i found that you can send SUBSCRIBE request just before the actual ，  # command that causes the overflow and you have a shellcode space of 520 bytes ，  # further down the stack. So you can club the 224 bytes you get at overflow time ，  # with this 520 and use a two stage shellcode. Too tired for that stunt so ，  # wrote this exploit which add user x with password x to the admin group. Too ，  # tired that i did not even clean up the code from the junk i used. You need to ，  # have a valid IMAP account for this exploit to work. ，  # Author shall bear no reponsibility for any screw ups caused by using this code ，  # Winny Thomas : - ) ",
