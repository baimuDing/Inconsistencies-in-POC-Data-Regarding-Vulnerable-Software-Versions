    "text": "ecve : CVE-1999-0787 ， title : SSH Communications Security SSH 1.2.27 - Authentication Socket File Creation - Linux local Exploit ， verified : Verified ， exploit_detail : source :  ， A vulnerability in SSH's creation of the authentication agent UNIX domain socket allows local users to create a UNIX domain socket with an arbitrary file name in the system. ， SSH has the concept of authentication proxying via the SSH authentication agent. It allows for a basic kind of Single Sign-On capability. The sshd daemon , ssh and ssh-agent communicate via a UNIX domain socket normally of the form '/tmp/ssh-<username>/agent-socket-<pid>'. ， SSH follows symbolic links while creating the socket as root thus allowing any local users with ssh access to create a socket with an arbitrary filename in the system. ， Notice that this will not work under all operating systems. Some operating systems do not follow symbolic links during bind ( 2 ) on UNIX domain sockets. Linux 2.0.x , Solaris 2.5.1 and IRIX 6.5.2 do not follow symbolic links during bind ( 2 ) . Linux 2.1.x does. ， You can use the following program by Dan Astoorian <djast @ cs.toronto.edu> to test whether your system does or does not follow symbolic links during bind ( 2 )  : ",
