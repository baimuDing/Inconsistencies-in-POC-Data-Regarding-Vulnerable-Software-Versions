    "text": "ecve : CVE-2003-1480 ， title : MySQL 3.x/4.0.x - Weak Password Encryption - Linux local Exploit ， verified : Verified ， exploit_detail : // source :  ， MySQL has been reported to implement a weak password encryption algorithm. It has been reported that the MySQL function used to encrypt MySQL passwords makes just one pass over the password and employs a weak left shift based cipher. The hash may be cracked in little time using a bruteforce method. ， An attacker may use information recovered in this way to aid in further attacks launched against the underlying system. ， / * This program is public domain. Share and enjoy. ，  * Example :  ，  *  $ gcc -O2 -fomit-frame-pointer mysqlfast.c -o mysqlfast ，  *  $ mysqlfast 6294b50f67eda209 ，  * Hash : 6294b50f67eda209 ，  * Trying length 3 ，  * Trying length 4 ，  * Found pass : barf ，  * The MySQL password hash function could be strengthened considerably ，  * by :  ，  * - making two passes over the password ，  * - using a bitwise rotate instead of a left shift ，  * - causing more arithmetic overflows ，  * /",
