It was installed by default in '/cgi-bin' by Red Hat Linux 5.2 and 6.0 installed with Squid. This script prompts for a host and port , which it then tries to connect to. If a webserver such as Apache is running , this can be used to connect to arbitrary hosts and ports , allowing for potential use as an intermediary in denial-of-service attacks , proxied port scans , etc. Interpreting the output of the script can allow the attacker to determine whether or not a connection was established. ，  #  !
