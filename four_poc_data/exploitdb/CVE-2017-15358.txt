    "text": "ecve : CVE-2017-15358 ， title : Charles Proxy 4.2 - Local Privilege Escalation - macOS local Exploit ， verified : Not Verified ， exploit_detail : Charles Proxy is a great mac application for debugging web services and ， inspecting SSL traffic for any application on your machine. ， In order to inspect the SSL traffic it needs to configure the system to use a ， proxy so that it can capture the packets and use its custom root CA to decode ， the SSL. ， Setting a system-wide proxy requires root permissions so this is handled by an ， suid binary located within the Charles application folder :  ， /Applications/Charles.app/Contents/Resources/Charles Proxy Settings ， Unfortunately this binary is vulnerable to a race condition which allows a local ， user to spawn a root shell. It supports a parameter \"-self-repair\" which it ， uses to re-set the root+suid permissions on itself , with a graphical dialog ， shown to the user. However if this is called when the binary is already ， root+suid then no password dialog is shown. ， It doesn't validate the path to itself and uses a simple API call to get the ， path to the binary at the time it was invoked. This means that between executing ， the binary and reaching the code path where root+suid is set there is enough ， time to replace the path to the binary with an alternate payload which will then ， receive the suid+root permissions instead of the Charles binary. ， This issue was fixed in Charles 4.2.1 released in November 2017. ， 2f4a2dca6563d05a201108ec6e9454e2894b603b68b3b70b8f8b043b43ee9284 ，  #  !
