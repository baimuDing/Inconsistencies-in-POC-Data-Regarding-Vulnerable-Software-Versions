The problem lies in memory used to store server input not being deallocated and eventually exhausted , causing the target NT host to freeze requiring a reboot. If a smtp client ( or user sending input manually ) sends multiple sequences of \"HELO/ MAIL FROM/ RCPT TO / DATA\" in a single connection , the memory allocated to store all of those values will not be freed and the target will stop functioning once memory runs out.",
