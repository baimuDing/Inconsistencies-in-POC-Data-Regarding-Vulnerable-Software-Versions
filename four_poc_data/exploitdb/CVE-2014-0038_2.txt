Zero out the three most ，  * significant bytes and thus turn it into a pointer to an address mappable in ，  * user space. ，  * The release pointer is used as it is followed by 16 0x00 bytes ( so the tv_nsec ，  * is valid ) . ，  * Open /dev/ptmx , close it and enjoy. ，  * Not very beautiful but should be fairly reliable if symbols can be resolved.",
