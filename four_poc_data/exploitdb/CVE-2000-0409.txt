Netscape creates a /tmp file which is world readable and writable in /tmp , without calling stat (  ) or fstat (  ) on the file. As such , it is possible , should a user be able to predict the file name , to cause a symbolic link to be created , and followed elsewhere on the file system. ， Additionally , as the file is created mode 666 prior to being fchmod (  ) 'd to 600 , there may be a window of opportunity for altering the contents of this file. ， This issue has only been demonstrated on the Linux binary , for glibc. The sparc Solaris binary does not behave this way. ， Predict the name of the temporary file. ， ln -sf /elsewhere /tmp/<tmpfilename> ， Alternately , a program which watches for the creation of these temporary files , opens them upon their creation , and alters the contents can be written.",
