    "text": "ecve : CVE-1999-0841 ， title : Solaris 7.0 - CDE dtmail/mailtool Buffer Overflow - Solaris local Exploit ， verified : Verified ， exploit_detail : // source :  ， here are three buffer overflow vulnerabilities in the CDE mail utilities , all of which are installed sgid mail by default. ， The first is exploited through overrunning a buffer in the Content-Type : field , which would look something like this :  ， Content-Type : image/aaaaaaaa long 'a' aaaaaa ; name=\"test.gif\" ， mailtool will overflow when email is selected which has a content-type field like that. It may be possible for an attacker to obtain root priviliges if shellcode is written appropriately and root selects the malicious email message. ， The second vulnerability is in dtmail , which will crash ( and possibly execute arbitrary code ) if a long paramater is passed argumenting the -f command-line option. ， The third is in mailpr , which is vulnerable to a long -f paramater as well. ， The most basic consequence of these being exploited is a compromise of local email , since all mail data is set mode 660 , read and write permissions granted for members of group mail. ， As of November 30 , 1999 , Solaris 7 is the only known vulnerable platform. ， ex_mailtool.c ， / * ============================================================================= ， Solaris mailtool exploit for Solaris7 Intel Edition ， The Shadow Penguin Security (  ， Written by UNYUN ( shadowpenguin @ backsection.net )  ， Descripton :  ， Local user can read/write any user's mailbox ， Usage :  ， setenv DISPLAY yourdisply ， gcc ex_mailtool.c ， ./a.out /var/mail/ [ any user ]  ， - Choice \"exploit @ localhost\" mail ，  * /",
