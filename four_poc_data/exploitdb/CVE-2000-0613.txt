    "text": "ecve : CVE-2000-0613 ， title : PIX Firewall 2.7/3.x/4.x/5 - Forged TCP RST - Hardware remote Exploit ， verified : Verified ， exploit_detail : // source :  ， A connection through a Cisco Secure PIX Firewall can be reset by a third party if the source and destination IP addresses and ports of the connection can be determined or inferred. This can be accomplished by sending a forged TCP Reset ( RST ) packet to the firewall , containing the same source and destination addresses and ports ( in the TCP packet header ) as the connection to be disrupted. The attacker would have to possess detailed knowledge of the connection table in the firewall ( which is used to track outgoing connections and disallow any connections from the external network that were not initiated by an internal machine ) or be able to otherwise determine the required IP address and port information to exploit this. ， / * reset_state.c ( c ) 2000 Citec Network Securities * / ， / * The code following below is copyright Citec Network Securities * / ， / * Code was developed for testing , and is written to compile under * / ， / * FreeBSD * /",
