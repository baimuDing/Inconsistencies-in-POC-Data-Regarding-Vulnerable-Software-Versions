    "text": "ecve : CVE-2000-1180 ， title : Oracle 8.x - cmctl Buffer Overflow - Linux local Exploit ， verified : Verified ， exploit_detail : / *  ， source :  ， cmctl is the Connection Control Manager , part of the Oracle 8i installation. A vulnerability exists that can allow elevation of privileges. ， The problem occurs in the way cmctl handles the user-supplied command line arguments. The string representing argv [ 1 ]  ( the first user-supplied commandline argument ) is copied into a buffer of predefined length without being checked to ensure that its length does not exceed the size of the destination buffer. As a result , the excessive data that is written to the buffer will write past its boundaries and overwrite other values on the stack ( such as the return address ) . ， This can lead to the user executing supplied shellcode with the effective privileges of cmctl , egid dba and euid oracle. ，  * / ， / *  ， Exploit Code for cmctl in Oracle 8.1.5 ( 8i ) for Linux. I tested in RH ， 6.2 ， and 6.1. Is possible to export to others platforms. ， If someone exports this to Sparc please tell me. ， synopsis : buffer overflow in cmctl ， Impact : any user gain euid=oracle and egid=dba. ， Dedicated to cmlc guys : juaroflin , oscar , ismak , blas , blackbas and ， others. ， Thanks for your patience and time. ， Special Thanks to my favourite DBA.
