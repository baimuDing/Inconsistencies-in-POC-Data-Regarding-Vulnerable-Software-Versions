    "text": "ecve : CVE-2005-0116 ， title : AWStats 6.0 < 6.2 - 'configdir' Remote Command Execution - CGI webapps Exploit ， verified : Verified ， exploit_detail : / *  ， AwStats exploit by Thunder , molnar_rcs @ yahoo.com ， This exploit makes use of the remote command execution bug discovered in ， AwStats ver 6.2 and below. The bug resides in the awstats.pl perl script. ， The script does not sanitise correctly the user input for the ， `configdir` parameter. If the users sends a command prefixed and postfixed ， with |  , the command will be executed. An example would be :  ， Let's execute '/usr/bin/w' :  ， Awstat output :  ， Error : LogFile parameter is not defined in config/domain file ， Setup ( ' | /usr/bin/w | /awstats.localhost.conf' file , web server or permissions ) may be wrong. ， Check config file , permissions and AWStats documentation ( in 'docs' directory ) . ， That's it. Our command was executed. ， This bug is fixed in AwStats ver 6.3 and a patch was released for all versions , but vulnerable ， AwStat is still available for download on several sites ( ex. www.topshareware.com ) . ， Type `gcc awexpl.c - o awexpl` to compile the exploit and `./awexpl -u` for usage. ， Note :  ， Just indexing the commands with | will not always work , or might not work at all. I checked ， it on my own awstats 6.0 install , and it failed. So , whoever tried the same on his own ， script and was surprised to see that ( although the version he uses is said to be prone to the ， remote command execution bug ) nothing happened , should patch or upgrade to Awstat 6.3 asap. ， As far as i know all unpached versions prior to 6.3 are vulnerable and commands prefixed and ， postfixed by a | character WILL be executed. Beware !  ， Oh , I almost forgot , the disclaimer :  )  ， THIS PROGRAM IS FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES * ONLY * IT IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\" ， AND WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY. ， Robert Molnar ,  ， 21th jan 2005 ，  * /",
