As slocate is typically installed setgid , all commands executed by the attacker will be run with the elevated group privileges. ， Conflicting details have been released which provide information reporting that the issue described is not a buffer overflow. Furthermore , the programming error that occurs may not be a security issue and thus not exploitable. ， /usr/bin/slocate -c `perl -e \"",
