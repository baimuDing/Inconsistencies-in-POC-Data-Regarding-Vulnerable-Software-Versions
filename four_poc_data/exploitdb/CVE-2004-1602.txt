This can be accomplished by code execution path timing analysis attack at the ProFTPd login procedure. There is a very small ( but significant ) difference in time delay of code execution path between valid and non-valid user names. That can be used to remotely determine the difference between existent and non-existent users. The time delay can be measured by using a simple FTP client that will calculate elapsed time between 'USER' command sent by client , and the server response. Because of the very short response period , elapsed time should be measured in microseconds.",
