Felix , Jenna , and Isaac. ， Vulnerability Description :  ， This vulnerability involves a memory comparison function that is ， remotely , anonymously accessible via the remote procedure call in ， the Diskeeper administrative interface. Using this , an attacker ， can guess / brute force memory at any address in the process ;  ， although passing a bad pointer will cause a memory read exception ， and DoS the process. Since causing a Denial of Service for ， Diskeeper is of minimal consequence , this write-up will focus on ， the memory reading aspect. ， By making use of shared user memory at 0x7FFE0000 , an attacker can ， learn information , such as Windows drive , path , and version. More ， importantly for a targeted attack , an attacker can also get the ， name , path , version and base address of all loaded modules in the ， process. This would essentially defeat address space randomization ，  ( ASLR ) in Windows Vista , since loaded modules tend to have the same ， preferred address in all processes for each boot of the system. ， Details :  ， Diskeeper introduced their administrative interface in Diskeeper 9 ， and continued it in Diskeeper 10 and Diskeeper 2007. For the ， purpose of this vulnerability I tested in Diskeeper 9 Professional ， and Diskeeper 2007 Pro Premier. ( Though I believe from ， documentation that the Server Editions of each and both versions in ， Diskeeper 10 are equally vulnerable. )  ， The administrative interface , DkService.exe , runs as a system ， service that is by default configured to automatically start. It ， listens on TCP port 31038 and has three RPC functions available. ， Calling the opcode 0x01 RPC function ( MIDL below ) allows a remote ,  ， anonymous memory comparison at an attacker provided address. ， Simply pass the size of the data , the data , and the address to make ， use of this. ， MIDL ， / * op",
