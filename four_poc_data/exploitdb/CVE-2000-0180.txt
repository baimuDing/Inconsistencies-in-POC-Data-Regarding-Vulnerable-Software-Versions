    "text": "ecve : CVE-2000-0180 ， title : Generation Terrorists Designs & Concepts Sojourn 2.0 - File Access - CGI remote Exploit ， verified : Verified ， exploit_detail : source :  ， Any file that the webserver has read access to can be read on a server running the Sojourn search engine. ， The Sojourn software includes the ability to organize a website into categories. These categories can then be accessed via the sojourn.cgi Perl script. This is done by making a request for a URL like :  ， http : //target/cgi-bin/sojourn.cgi?cat=categoryname ， Each category has an associated .txt file based on the category name. The program appends the .txt extension onto the contents of the 'cat' variable. However , the program will accept and follow the '../' string in the variable contents , allowing read access to any .txt file the webserver can read. ， This restriction can be bypassed by appending %00 to the end of the requested file , which will prevent the .txt extension from being used in the filename. ， http : //target/cgi-bin/sojourn.cgi?cat=../../../../../../etc/passwd%00",
