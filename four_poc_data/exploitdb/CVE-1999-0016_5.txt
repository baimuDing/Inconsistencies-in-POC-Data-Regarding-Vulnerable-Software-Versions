When a packet of this sort is received , an infinite loop is initiated and the affected system halts. This is known to affect Windows 95 , Windows NT 4.0 up to SP3 , Windows Server 2003 , Windows XP SP2 , Cisco IOS devices & Catalyst switches , and HP-UX up to 11.00. ， It is noted that on Windows Server 2003 and XP SP2 , the TCP and IP checksums must be correct to trigger the issue. ， Update : It is reported that Microsoft platforms are also prone to this vulnerability. The vendor reports that network routers may not route malformed TCP/IP packets used to exploit this issue. As a result , an attacker may have to discover a suitable route to a target computer , or reside on the target network segment itself before exploitation is possible. ，  * /",
