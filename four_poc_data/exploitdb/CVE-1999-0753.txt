    "text": "ecve : CVE-1999-0753 ， title : Hughes Technologies Mini SQL ( mSQL ) 2.0/2.0.10 - Information Disclosure - Multiple remote Exploit ， verified : Verified ， exploit_detail : source :  ， Under certain versions of Mini SQL , the w3-msql CGI script allows users to view directories which are set for private access via .htaccess files. W3-mSQL converts any form data passed to a script into global Lite variables and these variables can then be accessed by your script code. ， When an HTML form is defined a field name is given to each element of the form. When the data is passed to W3-mSQL the field names are used as the variable names for the global variables. Once a set of variables has been created for each form element , the values being passed to the script are assigned to the variables. This is done automatically during start-up of the W3-mSQL program. ， First Approach :  ， This attack requires the attacker to know the location/directory structure of the site she is attacking. ， Second Approach :  ， This approach will gain the intruder a DES encrypted password which they can then attempt to crack it via any number of popular cracking utilites.",
