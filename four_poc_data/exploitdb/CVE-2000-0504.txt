Any libICE application which creates inet listening sockets can be remotely crashed. This is due to a bug in the handling of the SKIP_STRING macro. By supplying a large value for the skip value , it is possible to cause a pointer to point to uninitialized memory. This in turn will cause a segfault. ， This vulnerability will affect any application using TCP listening sockets in libICE. However , one more widespread use of libICE in this configuration is in the gnome-session program , part of the GNOME package. It is possible to cause the X session of a user to end by performing this denial of service against someone running GNOME. ， / * icebreak.c - Chris Evans * /",
