The consequence of this being exploited is a remote root compromise ( assuming that BIND is running as root , which is default ) . ， The second is a denial of service which can occur if BIND does not validate SIG records properly. ， The next is a bug which allows attackers to cause BIND to consume more file descriptors than can be managed , causing named to crash. ， The fourth vulnerability is another denial of service which can be caused locally if certain permission conditions are met when validating zone information loaded from disk files. ， The last is a vulnerability which has to do with closing TCP sockets. If protocols for doing so are not adhered to , BIND can be paused for 120 seconds at a time. ， / *  ，  * ADM CONFIDENTIAL -- ( ADM Confidential Restricted when ，  * combined with the aggregated modules for this product )  ，  * OBJECT CODE ONLY SOURCE MATERIALS ，  *  ( C ) COPYRIGHT ADM Crew. 1999 ，  * All Rights Reserved ，  * This module may not be used , published , distributed or archived without ，  * the written permission of the ADM Crew.

The shellcode will break chroot , do a getpeername on all open ，  * sockets , and dup to the first one that returns AFINET. It also forks and ，  * runs a command in case the fd duping doesn't go well. Solaris/SPARC is a ，  * bit more complicated.. we are going through a well trodden part of the ，  * code , so we don't get the context switch we need to have it populate the ，  * register windows from the stack. However , if you just hammer the service ，  * with requests , you will quickly get a context switch at the right time. ，  * Thus , the SPARC shellcode currently only breaks chroot , closes current ，  * fd's and runs a command. ，  * Also , the NetBSD shellcode doesn't break chroot because they stop the ，  * dir tricks. Of course , they allow mknods in chrooted environments , so ，  * if named is running as root , then it still might be expoitable. ，  * The non-exec stack patch version returns into a malloc'ed buffer , whose ，  * address can vary quite alot. Thus , it may not be as reliable as the other ，  * versions.. ，  * We broke this just a little in order to raise the bar on using it ，  *  ( just slightly ) .. If you'd like to test it on your own box , put a shell ，  * in /adm/sh , or /adm/ksh for solaris on the target machine. ，  * /",
