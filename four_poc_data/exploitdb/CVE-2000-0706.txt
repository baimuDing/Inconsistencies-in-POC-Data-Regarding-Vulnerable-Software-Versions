    "text": "ecve : CVE-2000-0706 ， title : Luca Deri ntop 1.2 a7-9/1.3.1 - Remote Buffer Overflow - Unix remote Exploit ， verified : Verified ， exploit_detail : // source :  ， ntop is a network usage monitoring tool for unix systems. It can be invoked at the console or as a server daemon , presenting statistics information via http with the -w parameter. In this mode , it is vulnerable to a buffer overflow before the user connecting to it can be authenticated. If exploited , an attacker can gain remote access to the system with the priviliges ntop is executing with. ， It is interesting to note that setuid ntop drops priviliges before this can be exploited , but is installed on * BSD systems only executable by members of group wheel. This leads to the assumption that it may often be executed as root ( since users in wheel typically have root access.. )  , so despite the fact that it drops priviliges it can still yield remote root access for the attacker if exploited when run as root.",
