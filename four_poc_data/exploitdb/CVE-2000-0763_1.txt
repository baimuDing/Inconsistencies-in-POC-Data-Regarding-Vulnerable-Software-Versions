    "text": "ecve : CVE-2000-0763 ， title : David Bagley xlock 4.16 - User Supplied Format String ( 1 ) - Unix local Exploit ， verified : Verified ， exploit_detail : // source :  ， A vulnerability exists in versions of the xlockmore program , originally written by David Bagley. It is believed to affect all versions of xlock derived from xlockmore. This includes the xlock shipped with a number of popular operating systems. ， Xlock is installed setuid root. Normally , the -d option to xlock is used to set the display it will be locking. This value is normally of the format hostname : portoffset , ie. x.host.com : 0 , to connect to the X server runnign on x.host.com , listening on port 6000. By supplying format strings in this value , it is possible to cause xlock to output numeric values. Using other format strings , it may be possible for an attacker to overwrite values on the stack. This may make it possible to execute arbitrary code with root privileges. ， While several vulnerable operating systems have been listed , this list is by no means complete. ， It has been reported that this vulnerability exists only in systems with versions of xlock that use the error (  ) call. ( it is also unverified whether the bug is in libc or xlib ) . ， / *  ， OpenBSD 2.6/2.7 xlock exploit by noir ， noir @ gsu.linux.org.tr ， tested only on OpenBSD/i386 2.6 ， thanks :  ， cengiz_turkmen @ hotmail.com for support !  ， greets : caddis <caddis @ dissension.net> orginal chpass exploit ， bind , CronoS , dustdvl , ppl from defcon7 , gsu-linux staff ， TESO , ADM , Lam3rz , SSG ，  * /",
