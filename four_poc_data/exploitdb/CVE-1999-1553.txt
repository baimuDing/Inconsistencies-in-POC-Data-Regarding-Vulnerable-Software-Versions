The bug appears when replying to a message with a long subject line , and only when autoquote is on. The exploit is trivial , but as the buffer is not very large you have to do very precise return address calculation. It is believed it IS remotely exploitable , but you have to know a lot about the machine you want to gain acces to. ，  * / ， / * 27/02/1999 exploit by XSFX @ iname.com.... this bug is not exploitable in any harmful way , at least not easily :  )  ， this only works if target xc-mail has enabled 'Autoquote' ( Preferences menu -> Quote -> Autoquote )  ， Given ESP values are for ， glibc2 0.99.6 dynamically linked official binary ， only when users clicks 'reply' in the message list window , NOT when reading message and clicking 'reply'... ， note : find your own adresses if you want to fuck people over , and get an evil shellcode :  ) and remember , the buffer is very small... ， 0xbffff140 in Eterm launched from WMaker 0xbfffe9f9 in xterm launched from Eterm... 0xbfffeb10 as root , in xterm , from xinitrc ， Greetings : to Jerome_ , Dunkahn , lionel doux , niark doux , kevin mitnick l'amis des koalas hergothrapeutes and to my cannabis seeds which are growing on their own while I'm coding :  ) and to all the Amidoux in the world.
