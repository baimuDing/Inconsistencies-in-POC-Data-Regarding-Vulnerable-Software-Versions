A buffer overflow condition has been found in the chkey program. Since chkey has setuid root permissions , an unauthorized user may be able to gain root access. ，  * / ， / *  ，  * stdioflow -- exploit for data overrun conditions ，  * adam @ math.tau.ac.il ( Adam Morrison )  ，  * This program causes programs which use stdio ( 3S ) and have data buffer ，  * overflow conditions to overwrite stdio's iob [  ] array of FILE structures ，  * with malicious , buffered FILEs. Thus it is possible to get stdio to ，  * overwrite arbitrary places in memory ; specifically , it overwrites a ，  * specific procedure linkage table entry with SPARC assembly code to ，  * execute a shell. ，  * Using this program involves several steps. ，  * First , find a code path which leads to the use of stdout or stderr after ，  * the buffer has been overwritten. The default case being ，  * strcpy ( buffer , argv [ 0 ]  )  ;  ，  * / we gave it wrong arguments / ，  * f",
