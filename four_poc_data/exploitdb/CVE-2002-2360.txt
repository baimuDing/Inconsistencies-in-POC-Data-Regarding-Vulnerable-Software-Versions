    "text": "ecve : CVE-2002-2360 ， title : Webmin 0.x - 'RPC' Privilege Escalation - Linux remote Exploit ， verified : Verified ， exploit_detail : source :  ， In cases where users of Webmin do not have root access on the underlying host , it may be possible to mount privilege escalation attacks on the underlying host. This normally occurs in configurations where multiple Webmin client systems have access to a centralized Webmin server. ， Webmin allows commands to be executed remotely on the underlying host from other Webmin client systems via the RPC module. However , the script that provides this facility does not sufficiently check the permissions of the source of the remote commands. As a result , it is possible for remote authenticated Webmin users to abuse this facility to execute commands ( as root ) on the underlying host. ， This may be exploited to gain root access to a system hosting the vulnerable software. ，  #  ! /usr/bin/perl ，  # urlize ，  # Convert a string to a form ok for putting in a URL ， sub urlize { ， local $ rv = $ _ [ 0 ]  ;  ，  $ rv = ~ s/ (  [ ^A-Za-z0-9 ]  ) /s",
