The vulnerability only requires ， the attacker to simply define the environment variable TTYPROMPT to a ， 6-character string , inside telnet. Jonathan believes this overflows an ， integer inside login , which specifies whether the user has been ， authenticated ( just a guess ) . ， Once connected to the remote host , you must type the username , followed ， by 64 \" c\"s , and a literal \"\\n\". You will then be logged in as the user ， without any password authentication. This should work with any account ， Example :  ， coma% telnet ， telnet> environ define TTYPROMPT abc",
