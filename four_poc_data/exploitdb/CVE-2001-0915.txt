It is designed to execute Makefiles and build programs. ， pmake is not typically setuid root , although some Linux distributions default to installing it this way. When a Makefile is executed by pmake , certain user-defined variables can be set in the Makefile by the user. One such variable is the shell definition variable , or .SHELL. By supplying a format string in the check= field of the .SHELL variable , it is possible to write to an arbitrary memory address of the program. This could result in the overwriting of the return address , and execution of arbitrary code with root privileges. ，  *  *  ，  * Pmake <= 2.1.33 local root exploit *  ，  * coded by IhaQueR @ IRCnet *  ，  * compile with gcc -pmexpl-c -o pm *  ，  * meet me at HAL '2001 *  ，  *  * ",
