The RAS API function RasGetDialParams performs no bounds checkings which leads to an exploitable buffer overflow. The RAS RASMAN.EXE components implements the RAS Autodial Manager and RAS Connection Manager services which are used to dial out. RASMAN.EXE is a system process and is run in the security context of the LocalSystem account. RASMAN.EXE uses the RasGetDialParams function to read in things such as the telephone number from the Phonebook ( rasphone.pbk ) when is tries to dial out. This leads to a vulnerability that can be exploited by creating a phonebook entry with executable code inserted in the phone number parameter. If the phone number is over 299 bytes in length the process's saved return address will be overwritten. ， / * This program produces a rasphone.pbk file that will cause and exploit a buffer overrun in * / ， / * RASMAN.EXE - it will drop the user into a Command Prompt started by the system. * / ， / * It operates by re-writing the EIP and pointing it back into our exploit string which calls * / ， / * the system (  ) function exported at address 0x780208C3 by msvcrt.dll ( ver 5.00.7303 ) on * / ， / * NT Server 4 ( SP3 & 4 ) . Look at the version of msvcrt.dll and change buffer [ 109 ] to buffer [ 112 ]  * / ， / * in this code to suit your version. msvcrt.dll is already loaded in memory - it is used by * / ， / * RASMAN.exe.
