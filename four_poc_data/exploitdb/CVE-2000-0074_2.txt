This can be accomplished by submitting the argument \"new_login\" with the value \"reset password\" to the plusmail script ( typically /cgi-bin/plusmail ) . Other arguments the script expects are \"username\" , \"password\" and \"password1\" , where username equals the new login name , password and password1 contain matching passwords to set the new password to. ， The specific affected versions have not been determined , and the developer cannot be located. ， / *  ，  * plusmail cgi exploit ， - missnglnk ， greets : herf , ytcracker , mosthated , tino ，  * /",
