A vulnerability ， has been found that may allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on ， servers or home routers running dnsmasq [ 1 ] with the TFTP service [ 2 ]  [ 3 ]  ， enabled ( '-enable-tfp' ) . This service is not enabled by default on most ， distributions ; in particular it is not enabled by default on OpenWRT or ， DD-WRT. Chances of successful exploitation increase when a long ， directory prefix is used for TFTP. Code will be executed with the ， privileges of the user running dnsmasq , which is normally a ， non-privileged one. ， Additionally there is a potential DoS attack to the TFTP service by ， exploiting a null-pointer dereference vulnerability. ， 4. * Vulnerable packages *  ， . dnsmasq 2.40. ， . dnsmasq 2.41. ， . dnsmasq 2.42. ， . dnsmasq 2.43. ， . dnsmasq 2.44. ， . dnsmasq 2.45. ， . dnsmasq 2.46. ， . dnsmasq 2.47. ， . dnsmasq 2.48. ， . dnsmasq 2.49. ， . Older versions are probably affected too , but they were not checked. ， 5. * Non-vulnerable packages *  ， . dnsmasq 2.50 ， 6. * Vendor Information , Solutions and Workarounds *  ， If the TFTP service is enabled and patching is not available ， immediately , a valid workaround is to filter TFTP for untrusted hosts in ， the network ( such as the Internet ) . This is the default configuration ， when enabling TFTP on most home routers. ， Patches are already available from the software author. Most ， distributions should release updates for binary packages soon. ， 7. * Credits *  ， The heap-overflow vulnerability ( CVE-2009-2957 ) was discovered during ， Bugweek 2009 by Pablo Jorge and Alberto Solino from the team \"Los ， Herederos de Don Pablo\" of Core Security Technologies. ， The null-pointer dereference ( CVE-2009-2958 ) was reported to the author ， of dnsmasq independently by an uncredited code auditor. It was merged ， with this advisory for user's convenience. ， 8. * ",
