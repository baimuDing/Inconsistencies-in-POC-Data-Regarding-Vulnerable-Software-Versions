UPnP support ships with Windows XP and ME. For Windows 98 and 98SE , it is available with Windows XP's Internet Connection Sharing client. It should be noted that UPnP services are enabled on Windows XP by default. ， When processing the location field in a NOTIFY directive , UPnP server process memory can be overwritten by data that originated in the packet. If the IP address , port and filename components are of excessive length , access violations will occur when the server attempts to dereference pointers overwritten with data from the packet. ， It should be noted that the service listens on broadcast and multicast interfaces. This could permit an attacker to exploit a number of systems without knowing their individual IP addresses , if they employed an exploitation method targeting a UDP port. It is however possible to exploit this condition using either the TCP or UDP protocols. ， The UPnP service runs in the LOCAL SERVICE security context. An attacker who successfully exploits this vulnerability could gain control over the target host. ， / *  ， EXPLOIT CODED BY JOCANOR ， PRIVATE DO NOT DISTRIBUTE ， this is a new and functional exploit for de vulnerability ， affects to windows xp , at the service UPNP , port 5000. ， this exploit is a part of ASQ12 project , same as XPhack.c coded ， also be me... ， you only type :  ， argoxp victimip ， and later , in another cmd type :  ， nc victimip 1981 ， note :  ， you need netcat. ， note2 :  ， this exploit affects to windows xp + sp0 english version. ， EXPLOIT CODED BY JOCANOR ，  * /",
