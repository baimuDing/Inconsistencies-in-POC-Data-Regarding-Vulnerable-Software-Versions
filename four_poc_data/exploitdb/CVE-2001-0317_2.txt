It was originally written by Linus Torvalds , and is maintained by a community of developers. ， A problem in the Linux Kernel could make it possible for a local user to gain elevated privileges. A problem with the checking of process tracing on programs attempting to execute other programs that are setuid or setgid. It is possible to trace a process after it has entered a setuid or setgid execution state. ， This makes it possible for a local user to change parts of the process as they function , and potentially gain elevated privileges. ，  * / ， / *  ，  * epcs2 ( improved by lst [ liquid @ dqc.org ]  )  ，  * exploit for execve/ptrace race condition in Linux kernel up to 2.2.18 ，  * originally by :  ，  *  ( c ) 2001 Wojciech Purczynski / cliph / <wp @ elzabsoft.pl> ，  * improved by :  ，  * lst [ liquid @ dqc.org ]  ，  * This sploit does _not_ use brute force. It does not need that. ，  * It does only one attemt to sploit the race condition in execve. ，  * Parent process waits for a context-switch that occur after ，  * child task sleep in execve. ，  * It should work even on openwall-patched kernels ( I haven't tested it ) . ，  * Compile it :  ，  * cc epcs.c -o epcs ，  * Usage :  ，  * ./epcs [ victim ]  ，  * It gives instant root shell with any of a suid binaries. ，  * If it does not work , try use some methods to ensure that execve ，  * would sleep while loading binary file into memory ,  ，  * i.e. : ",
