    "text": "ecve : CVE-1999-0744 ， title : Netscape FastTrack Server 2.0.1a - GET Buffer Overflow - UnixWare remote Exploit ， verified : Verified ， exploit_detail : // source :  ， The version of Netscape FastTrack server that ships with UnixWare 7.1 is vulnerable to a remote buffer overlow. By default , the httpd listens on port 457 of the UnixWare host and serves documentation via http. If you pass the server a GET request with more than 367 characters , the stack overflows and the EIP is overwritten making it possible to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the httpd ( usually nobody ) . ， / uwhelp.c - remote exploit for UnixWare's Netscape FastTrack = ， 2.01a scohelp http service ， Runs the command of your choice with uid of the http daemon ，  ( probably nobody ) . If there are spaces in your command , use ，  $ {IFS} instead of a space. httpd handles execve's strangely ,  ， so your best bet is to just exec an xterm as I've done below. ， Obviously , change the command below to suit your needs. ， Compile on UW7.1 : cc -o uwhelp uwhelp.c -lnsl -lsocket ， run : ./uwhelp hostname <offset> <size> ， Brock Tellier btellier @ usa.net",
