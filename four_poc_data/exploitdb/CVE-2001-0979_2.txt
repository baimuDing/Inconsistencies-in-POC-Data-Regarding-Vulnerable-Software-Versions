    "text": "ecve : CVE-2001-0979 ， title : HP-UX 11.0 - SWVerify Buffer Overflow - HP-UX local Exploit ， verified : Verified ， exploit_detail : // source :  ， HP-UX is the UNIX Operating System variant distributed by Hewlett-Packard , available for use on systems of size varying from workgroup servers to enterprise systems. ， A problem has been discovered in the operating system that can allow a local user to gain elevated privileges. swverify contains a buffer overflow which is exploitable upon receiving 6039 bytes as an argument. The swverify program is setuid root , which allows a local user to execute code as root , potentially gaining administrative access to the vulnerable system. ， / *  ， Copyright FOO ， This code may be distributed freely so long as it is kept in its entirety. ， \"I have long said that the Internet is too complex to secure. One of the ， reasons is that it is too complex to understand.\" ， \"It's the authors of the worm and its variants , eEye for publicizing the ， vulnerability , and especially Microsoft for selling a product with this ， security problem.\" ， Didn't you just say that the Internet is too complex to even understand let ， alone secure? And now it's Microsoft's fault. How should they be able to ， magically know all the answers? Oh , I know , security is a process... ， \"If software companies were held liable for systematic problems in ， its products , just like other industries ( remember Firestone tires )  , we'd ， see a whole lot less of this kind of thing.\" ， Yes , I remember Firestone tires. Bridgestone/Firestone Inc. sold people ， a bunch of faulty tires. The wheel is certainly not \"too complex to ， understand\". After all , we've had 5000 years of R&D time ; the public ， expects products that work right. Web servers , on the other hand , are ， a somewhat newer invention. Thanks for the phony analogy , Bruce. ， \"You can argue that eEye did the right thing by publicizing this ， vulnerability , but I personally am getting a little tired of them adding ， weapons to hackers' arsenals. I support full disclosure and believe that ， it has done a lot to improve security , but eEye is going too far.\" ， I could go into the whole full disclosure debate , but I'd honestly rather ， get a root canal. Instead , I'll just point out how wrong you are. How can ， you support full disclosure and not support eEye fully disclosing this issue ， to the public? More importantly , why do you even care? The debate is over ,  ， full disclosure died when Jeff Moss started blackhat , bugtraq went corporate ,  ， and @ stake bought the scene. The community at large has already rejected ， full disclosure. Anyone who thinks otherwise is naive. In reality the so ， called blackhats find most of the holes and only share them with their ， friends. Everyone can argue the pros and cons of full disclosure and try ， to start up hopeless little private 0 day clubs for vendors and \"authorized\" ， researchers until hell freezes over , or Microsoft releases a quality product. ， In the end , it's just a bunch of people who don't know , arguing with the ， bunch who don't get it. Blame eEye and Microsoft all you want if it makes ， you feel better. If you bitch at them long enough they might just join the ， rest of the real researchers out there who don't do public disclosure and ， only report to known and trusted peers. ( read : other blackhats )  ， The real problem here is that the clueless have convinced themselves that the ， computer security underground is nothing more than packs of socially ， challenged adolescent boys running around with proof of concept exploit code ， written by whitehats. Some have even deluded themselves into thinking that ， they should be the ones who are the gate keepers of vulnerability info. ，  ( Russ Cooper comes to mind. ) Congratulations , the war is over. You won. The ， public is now either defenseless or paying by the hour. ， Don't bite the hand that feeds you or you won't get any more scraps from ， the table. ， I will leave you with this HPUX 11 local root exploit code. /usr/sbin/sw *  ， are all setuid root by default and all contain buffer overflows. I didn't ， bother notifying HP about this at all. I just don't give a fuck. ，  * /",
