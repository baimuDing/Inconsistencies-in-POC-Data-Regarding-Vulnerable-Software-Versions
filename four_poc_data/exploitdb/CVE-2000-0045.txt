It is possible for users with GRANT access to change passwords for every user in the database ( including the mysql superuser ) . MySQL also ships with a default \"test\" account which has GRANT privileges and is unpassworded , meaning anyone can connect to the db. These two problems combined can result in a total , remote ( and probably anonymous ) database compromise. The database can be compromised even if the test account is disabled ( given a local user account with GRANT privs ) .",
