    "text": "ecve : CVE-1999-0460 ， title : Linux Kernel 2.0/2.1/2.2 - 'autofs' Denial of Service - Linux dos Exploit ， verified : Verified ， exploit_detail : source :  ， The autofs module provides support for the automount filesystem , as well as the interface between the kernel and the automountd daemon , which is responsible for the actual mounting. Calls such as chdir (  ) executed in the automount directory are handled by the module , and if the desired directory is defined in the configuration files , automountd then mounts that directory/device. When a chdir (  ) or similar function is called in the autofs directory , by a user doing something along the lines of \"cd xxxx\" , the function fs/autofs/root.c : autofs_root_lookup (  ) is called. ， The autofs kernel module does not check the size of the directory names it receives. It is passed the name and the names length through dentry->d_name.name and dentry->d_name.len respectively. Later on it memcpy (  ) 's the name into a 256 byte buffer , using dentry->d_name.len as the number of bytes to copy , without checking its size. A nonprivilaged user may attempt to cd to a directory name exceeding 255 characters. This overwrites memory , probably the kernel stack and anything beyond it , and causes kernel errors or makes the machine reboot . ， In this example exploit , we have a user using perl to generate a directory name that's 256 characters ( the maximum being 255 ) . The buffer for the directory name will overflow by one byte in this case :  ，  [ user @ localhost auto-mounted-dir ]  # cd `perl -e '",
