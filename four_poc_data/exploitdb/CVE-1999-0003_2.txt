The affected program runs on many popular UNIX operating systems supporting CDE and some Open Windows installs. ， The ToolTalk service allows independently developed applications to communicate with each other by exchanging ToolTalk messages. Using ToolTalk , applications can create open protocols which allow different programs to be interchanged , and new programs to be plugged into the system with minimal reconfiguration. ， The ToolTalk database server ( rpc.ttdbserverd ) is an ONC RPC service which manages objects needed for the operation of the ToolTalk service. ToolTalk-enabled processes communicate with each other using RPC calls to this program , which runs on each ToolTalk-enabled host. This program is a standard component of the ToolTalk system , which ships as a standard component of many commercial Unix operating systems. The ToolTalk database server runs as root. ， Due to an implementation fault in rpc.ttdbserverd , it is possible for a malicious remote client to formulate an RPC message that will cause the server to overflow an automatic variable on the stack. By overwriting activation records stored on the stack , it is possible to force a transfer of control into arbitrary instructions provided by the attacker in the RPC message , and thus gain total control of the server process. ， / * copyright LAST STAGE OF DELIRIUM jul 1998 poland *  : //lsd-pl.net/ #  * / ， / * rpc.ttdbserverd #  * /",
