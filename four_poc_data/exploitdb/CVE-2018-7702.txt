Ettlinger ( Office Vienna )  ， SEC Consult Vulnerability Lab ， An integrated part of SEC Consult ， Europe | Asia | North America ， Vendor description :  ， \"Sending and receiving encrypted emails is not an easy or simple experience. ， Businesses rely on email with an increasing amount of sensitive data sent across ， their networks. A revolutionary approach that doesn't suffer from the overheads ， of deployment and encryption management ; just rock-solid security to give you ， 100% confidence in your business communications.\" ， URL :  ， Business recommendation :  ， During a brief crash test of the SecurEnvoy SecurMail application several severe ， vulnerabilities have been identified that break the core security promises of ， the product. ， These vulnerabilities open the possibility for several different attack ， scenarios that allow an attacker to read other users' encrypted e-mails and ， overwrite or delete e-mails stored in other users' inboxes. ， As we have identified several critical vulnerabilities within a very short time ， frame we expect numerous other vulnerabilities to be present. ， As other SecureEnvoy products ( besides the analyzed SecurMail ) appear ， to be highly integrated ( all products are installed with a single setup ， file ) we suspect other components to also suffer from severe security deficits. ， We recommend not to use SecurEnvoy products ( especially SecurMail ) in a ， production environment until :  ，  * a comprehensive security audit has been performed and ，  * state of the art security mechanisms have been adopted. ， Vulnerability overview/description :  ， 1 ) Cross Site Scripting ( CVE-2018-7703 , CVE-2018-7707 )  ， SEC Consult did not find any functionality that encodes user input when creating ， HTML pages. Therefore persistent and reflected cross site scripting attacks are ， possible throughout the application. ， Some pages fail to properly decode URL encoded parameters. Because of this , cross ， site scripting cannot be exploited on these pages in most browsers. ， 2 ) Path Traversal ( CVE-2018-7705 , CVE-2018-7706 )  ， SEC Consult did not find any path traversal checks throughout the application. ， Since the application uses encrypted files as the primary method of data ， storage , this vulnerability can be exploited at several points. ， Using this vulnerability , a legitimate recipient can read mails sent to other ， recipients in plain text !  ， 3 ) Insecure Direct Object ， Authorization checks are only partially implemented. This allows a legitimate ， recipient to read mails sent to other users in plain text. ， 4 ) Missing Authentication and Authorization ( CVE-2018-7702 )  ， In order to send encrypted e-mails a client does not need to authenticate on the ， SecurEnvoy server. Therefore anyone with network access to the server can ， arbitrarily send e-mails that appear to come from an arbitrary sender address. ， Moreover , an attacker with network access to the server can re-send previous ， communication to arbitrary recipients. This allows him/her to extract all ， e-mails stored on the server. An attacker could also modify arbitrary messages ， stored on the server. ， 5 ) Cross Site Request Forgery ( CVE-2018-7701 )  ， SEC Consult did not find any protection against cross site request forgery. An ， attacker could use this vulnerability to delete a victim's e-mail or to ， impersonate the victim and reply to his/her e-mails. ， Since these vulnerabilities were found during a very short time frame , SEC ， Consult believes that the product may contain a large number of other security ， vulnerabilities. As already several core security promises have been broken ， during this short crash test , no further tests were conducted. ， Proof of concept :  ， 1 ) Cross Site Scripting ， a ) The following HTML fragments demonstrates reflected cross site scripting ，  ( CVE-2018-7703 )  :  ， --- snip ---",
