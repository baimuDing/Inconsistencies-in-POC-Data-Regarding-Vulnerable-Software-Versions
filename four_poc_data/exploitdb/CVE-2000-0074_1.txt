It is reportedly possible to change the administrative username and password without knowing the current one , by passing the proper arguments to the plusmail script. After this has been accomplished , the web console allows a range of potentially destructive activities including changing of e-mail aliases , mailing lists , web site editing , and various other privileged tasks. This can be accomplished by submitting the argument \"new_login\" with the value \"reset password\" to the plusmail script ( typically /cgi-bin/plusmail ) . Other arguments the script expects are \"username\" , \"password\" and \"password1\" , where username equals the new login name , password and password1 contain matching passwords to set the new password to. ， The specific affected versions have not been determined , and the developer cannot be located. ， / *  ，  *  [ Synnergy Networks ，  * Title : plusbug.c - [ remote plusmail exploit ]  ，  * Author : headflux ( hf @ synnergy.net )  ，  * Date : 01.10.2000 ，  * Description : plusmail fails to check authenticity before creating new ，  * accounts ，  *  [ Synnergy Networks ( c ) 2000 ,  ，  * /",
