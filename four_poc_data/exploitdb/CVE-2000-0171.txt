    "text": "ecve : CVE-2000-0171 ， title : AT Computing atsar_linux 1.4 - File Manipulation - Linux local Exploit ， verified : Verified ， exploit_detail : source :  ， atsar is a linux load monitoring software package released under the GPL by AT Computing. atsadc is a setuid root binary that is included in the atsar package. atsadc is setuid because it obtains informatin via /dev/kmem. atsadc will accept as an argument an output file , which it will open -- without checking to make sure the user executing atsadc has the priviliges to do so. After it has opened and created ( or overwritten ) the target file as root , the permissions set on the file will allow the attacker to write to it. Since this file is arbitrary , it is possible to gain root locally in any number of ways through creating malicious system files. In Teso's proof of concept exploit , root priviliges are gained by creating a malicious shared library to be preloaded and creating/specifying that library in /etc/ld.so.preload ( and then executing a setuid binary.. ) . ， Starting with atsar 1.5 the program is no longer suid root as it obtains its information via the /proc file system. ，  #  ! /usr/bin/perl ，  # Halloween 4 local root-exploit , other distros are maybe ，  # affected as well. ( atsadc program )  ，  #  ( C ) 2000 C-skills development , S. Krahmer under the GPL ，  # Exploit will create /etc/ld.so.preload , so it should NOT exist ，  # already. THIS FILE WILL BE LOST !  ，  #  ! USE IT AT YOUR OWN RISK !  ，  # For educational purposes only.",
