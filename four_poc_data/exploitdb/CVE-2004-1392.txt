This issue is due to a failure of the cURL module to properly enforce PHPs 'open_basedir' restriction. ， Users with the ability to create or modify PHP scripts on a server computer hosting the vulnerable software can reportedly exploit this vulnerability to bypass the 'open_basedir' restriction , and access arbitrary files with the privileges of the web server. This may aid them in further attacks. ， This vulnerability possibly results in a false sense of security , as administrators expect that the restrictions in place prevent malicious users from gaining access to sensitive information. ， <?php ，  $ ch = curl_init ( \"file : ///etc/parla\" )  ;  ，  $ file=curl_exec (  $ ch )  ; ",
