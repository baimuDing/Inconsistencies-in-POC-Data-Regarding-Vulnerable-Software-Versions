    "text": "ecve : CVE-2008-5314 ， title : ClamAV < 0.94.2 - JPEG Parsing Recursive Stack Overflow ( PoC ) - Multiple dos Exploit ， verified : Verified ， exploit_detail : / *  ， There is a recursive stack overflow in clamav 0.93.3 and 0.94 ( and probably ， older versions ) in the jpeg parsing code. ， it scan's the jpeg file , and if there is a thumbnail , it'll scan that too. the ， thumbnail itself is just another jpeg ， file and the same jpeg scanning function gets called without checking any kind ， of recurising limit. this can easely ， lead to a recurisive stack overflow. the vulnerable code looks like :  ， clamav-0.94\\libclamav\\special.c ， int cli_check_jpeg_exploit ( int fd ) <-- fd to jpeg file ， static int jpeg_check_photoshop ( int fd )  ， retval = jpeg_check_photoshop_8bim ( fd )  ;  ， static int jpeg_check_photoshop_8bim ( int fd )  ， retval = cli_check_jpeg_exploit ( fd )  ; <-- calls cli_check_jpeg_exploit (  )  ， again without any recursive checks !  ， the exploit shown below triggers this recursive stack overflow by creating a ， fake jpg file. once created and passed on ， to clamav it'll go in a recursive stack loop untill clamav runs out of stack ， memory and causes a stack overflow. effectively ， crashing clamav. The exploit was tested on clamav 0.94 on opensolaris running ， in a vmware.",
