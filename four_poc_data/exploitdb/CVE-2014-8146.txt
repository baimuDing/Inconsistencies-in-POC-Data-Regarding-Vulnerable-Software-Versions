ICU is widely portable and gives applications the same results on all platforms and between C/C++ and Java software. ， Summary :  ， While fuzzing LibreOffice an integer overflow and a heap overflow were found in the ICU library. This library is used by LibreOffice and hundreds of other software packages. ， Proof of concept files can be downloaded from [ 1 ] . These files have been tested with LibreOffice 4.3.3.2 and LibreOffice 4.4.0-beta2 and ICU 52. ， Note that at this point in time it is unknown whether these vulnerabilities are exploitable. ， Thanks to CERT [ 2 ] for helping disclose these vulnerabilities. ， Technical details :  ，  # 1 ， Vulnerability : Heap overflow ， CVE-2014-8146 ， The code to blame is the following ( from ubidi.c : 2148 in ICU 52 )  :  ， dirProp=dirProps [ limit-1 ]  ;  ， pBiDi->isolateCount++ ;  ， pBiDi->isolates [ pBiDi->isolateCount ] .stateImp=stateImp ;  ， pBiDi->isolates [ pBiDi->isolateCount ] .state=levState.state ;  ， pBiDi->isolates [ pBiDi->isolateCount ] .start1=start1 ;  ， processPropertySeq ( pBiDi , &levState , eor , limit , limit )  ;  ， Under certain conditions isolateCount is incremented too many times , which results in several out of bounds writes. See [ 1 ] for a more detailed analysis. ，  # 2 ， Vulnerability : Integer overflow ， CVE-2014-8147 ， The overflow is on the resolveImplicitLevels function ( ubidi.c : 2248 )  :  ， pBiDi->isolates [ pBiDi->isolateCount ] .state=levState.state ;  ， pBiDi->isolates [  ] .state is a int16 , while levState.state is a int32. ， The overflow causes an error when performing a malloc on pBiDi->insertPoints->points because insertPoints is adjacent in memory to isolates [  ] . ， The Isolate struct is defined in ubidiimp.h : 184 ， type",
