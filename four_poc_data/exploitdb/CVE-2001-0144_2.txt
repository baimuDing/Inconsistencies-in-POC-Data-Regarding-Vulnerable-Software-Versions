    "text": "ecve : CVE-2001-0144 ， title : SSH 1.2.x - CRC-32 Compensation Attack Detector - Unix remote Exploit ， verified : Verified ， exploit_detail : // source :  ， Secure Shell , or SSH , is an encrypted remote access protocol. SSH or code based on SSH is used by many systems all over the world and in a wide variety of commercial applications. An integer-overflow bug in the CRC32 compensation attack detection code may allow remote attackers to write values to arbitrary locations in memory. ， This would occur in situations where large SSH packets are recieved by either a client or server , and a 32 bit representation of the SSH packet length is assigned to a 16 bit integer. The difference in data representation in these situations will cause the 16 bit variable to be assigned to zero ( or a really low value ) . ， As a result , future calls to malloc (  ) as well as an index used to reference locations in memory can be corrupted by an attacker. This could occur in a manner that can be exploited to write certain numerical values to almost arbitrary locations in memory. ， This can lead to an attacker executing arbitrary code with the privileges of the SSH server ( usually root ) or the SSH client. ， UPDATE :  ， There have been reports suggesting that exploitation of this vulnerability may be widespread. ， Since early september , independent , reliable sources have confirmed that this vulnerability is being exploited by attackers on the Internet. Security Focus does not currently have the exploit code being used , however this record will be updated if and when it becomes available. ， NOTE : Cisco 11000 Content Service Switch family is vulnerable to this issue. All WebNS releases prior , but excluding , versions : 4.01 B42s , 4.10 22s , 5.0 B11s , 5.01 B6s , are vulnerable. ， Secure Computing SafeWord Agent for SSH is reportedly prone to this issue , as it is based on a vulnerable version of SSH. ， NetScreen ScreenOS is not directly vulnerable to this issue , however the referenced exploit will cause devices using vulnerable versions of the software to stop functioning properly. This will result in a denial of service condition for NetScreen devices. This issue is in the Secure Command Shell ( SCS ) administrative interface , which is an implementation of SSHv1. SCS is not enabled on NetScreen devices by default. ，  # Exploit code in the form of ssh client patches by Hugo Dias < bsphere @ clix.pt >. ， - --- packet.c Sat Oct 14 06 : 23 : 12 2000 ， +++ packet.c Tue Feb 20 09 : 33 : 00 2001 ， -68 , 6 +68 , 85",
