    "text": "ecve : CVE-2000-0405 ， title : Stake AntiSniff 1.0.1/Researchers 1.0 - DNS Overflow ( 3 ) - Multiple remote Exploit ， verified : Verified ， exploit_detail : // source :  ， Certain versions of @ Stake Inc.'s Antisniffer software contain a remotely exploitable buffer overflow. AntiSniff is a program that was released by L0pht Heavy Industries in July of 1999. It attempts , through a number of tests , to determine if a machine on a local network segment is listening to traffic that is not directed to it ( commonly referred to as sniffing ) . During one particular test there is a problem if a packet that does not adhere to DNS specifications is sent to the AntiSniff machine. This can result in a buffer overflow on the system running AntiSniff. If the packet is crafted appropriately this overflow scenario can be exploited to execute arbitrary code on the system. ， This scenario is only possible if AntiSniff is configured to run the DNS test and only during the time the test is running. Nonetheless , it is a vulnerability that should not be ignored and has even been found in other promiscuous mode detection programs as well. ， NOTE :  ， This information was taken verbatim from the L0pht advisory on the subject. This advisory is attached in full in the 'Credit' section of this advisory. ， / * l0phtl0phe.c - antisniff exploit ( 1-1-1 \"second fixed version\" included )  ，  * -scut/teso ，  * gcc -o l0phtl0phe l0phtl0phe.c -Wall -lnet `libnet-config -defines` ，  * description :  ，  * l0pht messed up the fix for their problem in antisniff by not regarding ，  * the type signedness properties of the char and int values used. this ，  * results in a cool method bypassing the too extra checks ( length + strncat ) . ，  * some work on this topic have been done by mixter ,  ( bad results on type ，  * casting )  , but it should be obvious to any security conscious programmers. ，  * i'm not stating that they aren't allowed errors , but they should fix it ，  * for sure if they're going to fix it at all. -sc. ，  * 2nd version : script kiddie proof to avoid that \"doesn't work\" lamer claim. ，  * greetings to all teso , lam3rz , hert , adm , w00w00 and lsd ppl. ，  * /",
