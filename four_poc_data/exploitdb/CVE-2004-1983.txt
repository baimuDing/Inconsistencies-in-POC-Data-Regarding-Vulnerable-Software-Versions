    "text": "ecve : CVE-2004-1983 ， title : PaX 2.6 Kernel Patch - Denial of Service - Linux dos Exploit ， verified : Verified ， exploit_detail : / *  ， source :  ， PaX for 2.6 series Linux kernels has been reported prone to a local denial of service vulnerability. The issue is reported to present itself when PaX Address Space Layout Randomization Layout ( ASLR ) is enabled. ， The vulnerability may be exploited by a local attacker to influence the kernel into an infinite loop. ，  * / ， / *  ， PaX w/ CONFIG_PAX_RANDMMAP for Linux 2.6.x DoS proof-of-concept ， by Shadowinteger <shadowinteger @ sentinix.org> ， 2004-05-04 ， Written after reading the security advisory posted by borg ( ChrisR- ) on ， Bugtraq 2004-05-03 ( my time ) . ChrisR -> www.cr-secure.net ， Acknowledgments : sabu ( www.sabu.net )  ， Vulnerability :  ， PaX code for 2.6.x prior to 2004-05-01 in arch_get_unmapped_area (  )  ，  ( function in mm/mmap.c ) is vulnerable to a local Denial of Service attack ， because of a bug that puts the kernel into an infinite loop. ， Read the security advisory for more info :  ， Exploitation :  ， We need to get passed the following line of code in ， arch_get_unmapped_area (  ) to succeed with a DoS :  ， We do it like this :  ， TASK_SIZE - TYPICAL_ADDR + SINK = DOSVAL ， DOSVAL is the value we'll use. ， arch_get_unmapped_area (  ) does the following :  ，  ( TASK_SIZE-DOSVAL )  * must * be less than TYPICAL_ADDR to succeed. ， A DOSVAL of e.g. 0x80000000 or above will work most times , no real need ， There are quite a few functions available that are \"front-ends\" to ， arch_get_unmapped_area (  ) . This exploit uses good-old mmap (  ) . ， Tiny DoS",
