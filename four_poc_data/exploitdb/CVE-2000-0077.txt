Because it talks to hardware , it is installed setuid root by default. ，  # During normal execution , Aserver executes \"ps\" via the system (  ) libcall , relying on the PATH environment variable to do so. As a result , a user can modify their PATH environment variable so that it includes an arbitrary program called 'ps' before executing Aserver. When Aserver is run with the -f argument , the offending system (  ) function will be called and the attacker's version of ps will be executed as root. ，  # This is a trivial root compromise. ，  #  ! /bin/sh ，  # HP-UX aserver.sh - Loneguard 18/10/98 ，  # Simple no brainer path poison followed by a twist [ inspired by DC ;  )  ]  ， cd /var/tmp",
