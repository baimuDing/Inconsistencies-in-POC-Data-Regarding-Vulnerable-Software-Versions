The vulnerability could allow elevation of privilege if ， a user receives a specially crafted WINS replication packet on an ， affected system running the WINS service. An attacker must have valid ， logon credentials and be able to log on locally in order to exploit this ， vulnerability. ， Malicious packets are processed by the vulnerable function ， 'ECommEndDlg' , reported in MS11-035 [ 1 ]  , but this time the pointers ， handled by this function are controlled by the attacker. ，  * Important :  * Given that this vulnerability is triggered by sending a ， specially crafted packet to the dynamic UDP port of the WINS service ，  ( which is binded to the loopback address '127.0.0.1' )  , this ， vulnerability can result in an elevation of privilege. Despite that , in ， old W2003 SP0 systems , the dynamic UDP port is binded to the '0.0.0.0' ， address , allowing remote code execution. ， 4. * Vulnerable packages *  ， .
