Overall Torrentflux makes it ，  # look quite nice. Solution use SecurityClean (  ) of viewnfo.php to solve the problem. ，  # Note : After just looking at the code for viewnfo.php of TorrentFlux 2.1 , it would seem that ，  # it is possible to also read the config.php file in the same way , since path was not sanitised. ，  # Although they have fixed this problem in 2.2 with a function i demonstrated to the ，  # developer for a previous vulnerability.",
