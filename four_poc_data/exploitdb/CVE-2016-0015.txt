DeviceMoniker :  : Load (  ) Heap Corruption Buffer Underflow ( MS16-007 ) - Windows dos Exploit ， verified : Verified ， exploit_detail : Source :  ， Heap corruption buffer underflow in devenum.dll ! DeviceMoniker :  : Load (  )  ， There exists a buffer underflow vulnerability in devenum.dll ! DeviceMoniker :  : Load when attempting to null terminate a user supplied string. The function as it exists on Windows 7 x86 is implemented as follows :  ， signed int __stdcall CDeviceMoniker :  : Load ( CDeviceMoniker * this , struct IStream * a2 )  ， struct IStream * v2 ; // esi @ 1 ， signed int v3 ; // edi @ 1 ， const unsigned __int16 * v4 ; // ebx @ 2 ， char v6 ; // [ sp+8h ]  [ bp-4h ]  @ 1 ， v2 = a2 ;  ， v3 = a2->lpVtbl->Read ( a2 , &a2 , 4 ,  ( ULONG *  ) &v6 )  ; // read a 4 byte user controlled length ， v4 = ( const unsigned __int16 *  ) operator new [  ]  (  ( unsigned int ) a2 )  ; // allocate length ， v3 = v2->lpVtbl->Read ( v2 ,  ( void *  ) v4 ,  ( ULONG ) a2 ,  ( ULONG *  ) &v6 )  ; // read data into new buffer ， v4 [  (  ( unsigned int ) a2 1 ) - 1 ] = 0 ; // BAD BAD BAD ， v3 = CDeviceMoniker :  : Init ( this , v4 )  ;  ， operator delete [  ]  (  ( void *  ) v4 )  ;  ， v3 = -2147024882 ;  ， The issue comes in when we specify a length of 1 with the first read. A buffer of length 1 will be allocated and 1 byte will be read into it. But , when the code goes to NULL terminate this buffer it divides the length by 2 and subtracts 2 ( v4 is a wchar_t ) leading to \"\\x00\\x00\" being written 2 bytes before the allocated buffer. ， This object \"device.1\" or {4315D437-5B8C-11D0-BD3B-00A0C911CE86} is reachable from any bit of software that performs an IPersistStream :  : Load on an arbritrary object. This vulnerable object is also reachable from any bit of software performing an OleLoad ( IID_IOleObject ) call with an with an attacker controlled CLSID -- as is the case in Office. ， In the attached Word Document",
