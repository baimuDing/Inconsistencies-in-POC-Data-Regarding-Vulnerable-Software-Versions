Because the way it parses ， the incoming data follows the rules defined in RFCs and not the reality ， of how the HTTP request parsers are implemented in Perl , Python , Java ,  ， PHP there are a number of bypass vulnerabilities when the RFC and ， reality mismatch. ， One of the these differences is the way ASCIIZ bytes are handled when ， they occur in POST data of the application/x-www-form-urlencoded ， content-type. Because mod_security handles POST data of this kind as a C ， string it does not touch anything behind the first ASCIIZ byte because ， in the eyes of mod_security this is the end of the data. ， Unfortunately for mod_security this is not how the HTTP parsers of the ， different script languages handle this situation. Most script languages ，  ( Perl , Python , ... ) just ignore the ASCIIZ byte and parse the data as if ， it is legal. Since PHP 5.2.0 this also applies to PHP.
