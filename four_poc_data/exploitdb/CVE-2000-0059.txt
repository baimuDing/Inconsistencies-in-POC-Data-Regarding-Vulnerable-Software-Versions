    "text": "ecve : CVE-2000-0059 ， title : PHP 3.0.13 - 'Safe_mode' Failure - PHP remote Exploit ， verified : Verified ， exploit_detail : source :  ， PHP Version 3.0 is an HTML-embedded scripting language. Much of its syntax is borrowed from C , Java and Perl with a couple of unique PHP-specific features thrown in. The goal of the language is to allow web developers to write dynamically generated pages quickly. ， Because it runs on a webserver and allows for user implemented ( and perhaps security relevant ) code to be executed on it , PHP has built in a security feature called 'safe_mode' to control executed commands to the webroot environment which PHP operates in. ， This is done by forcing any system call which executes shell commands to have their shell commands passed to the EscapeShellCmd (  ) function which ensures the commands do not take place outside the webroot directory. ， Under certain versions of PHP however , the popen (  ) command fails to be applied to the EscapeShellCmd (  ) command and as such users can possibly exploit PHP applications running in 'safe_mode' which make of use of the 'popen' system call. ， <?php ，  $ fp = popen ( \"ls -l /opt/bin ; /usr/bin/id\" , \"r\" )  ; ",
