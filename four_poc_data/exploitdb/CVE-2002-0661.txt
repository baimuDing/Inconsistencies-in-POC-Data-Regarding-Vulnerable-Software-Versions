Platforms that may be affected by this include Windows , OS2 , and Netware. ， The issue is related to the failure to properly process the backslash '\\' character , which may be used as a directory delimiter under these platforms. By using the URL encoded sequence '%2e%2e%5c' , the web root may be escaped. ， Exploitation may result in the disclosure of sensitive information. Additionally , arbitrary local programs may be executed with attacker supplied parameters if directory traversal techniques are used to escape the cgi-bin directory.",
