This CMS is scalable for small businesses to large corporations. ， TL ; DR :  ， XSS in admin console , weak CSRF protection and a possible PHP object insertion via unserialize. ， These vulnerabilities were considered unimportant by the CMS Made Simple developers. Their reasoning was that they had to be exploited by a logged in administrator user who is a trusted user anyway. When I explained to them that with XSS all you need to do is send a malicious link to the administrator , they responded back saying that they are confident in their CSRF protection. I then sent them an analysis of their CSRF protection ( at the bottom of this advisory )  , which I found to be quite weak. Finally they commited to implement a half-assed mitigation for the CSRF token weakness but said they will not fix the other issues. ， Timeline :  ， - 27.11.2013 : Initial contact to the emails listed in www.cmsmadesimple.com. No reply. ， - 03.12.2013 : Message posted in the www.cmsmadesimple.com public forum asking to contact me back. A few hours later I was contacted by calguy and sent him a more complete version of this advisory with recommendations. ， - 09.12.2013 : calguy responds saying these will not be fixed as you have to be an admin user anyway. ， - 13.12.2013 : After a few days arguing over email , Robert Campbell , CMS Made Simple project manager , responds with an official note saying they will double the CSRF token length in a future release but will not fix the rest of the issues. ， - 14.12.2013 : Handed over to CERT asking for help to try to reason with the CMS Made Simple developers. ， - 28.02.2014 : Public disclosure by CERT ， Vulnerability : Persistent cross site scripting ( XSS ) in add * pages ( CVE-2014-0334 )  ， File ( line )  : cmsmadesimple/admin/addgroup.php ( 107 )  ， File ( line )  : cmsmadesimple/admin/addhtmlblob.php ( 165 )  ， File ( line )  : cmsmadesimple/admin/addbookmark.php ( 92/96 )  ， Code snippet :  ， addgroup.php :  ，  $ group= \"\" ;  ， <div",
