These include MIT Kerberos 5 releases 1.0.x , 1.1 and 1.1.1 , MIT Kerberos 4 patch level 10 ( and , most likely , prior releases )  , and Cygnus KerbNet and Network Security ( CNS ) . The main source of problems is due to a buffer overflow in the krb_rd_req (  ) library function. This function is used by every application that supports Kerberos 4 authentication , including , but not limited to , kshrd , klogin , telnetd , ftpd , rkinitd , v4rcp and kpopd. Therefore , it is possible for a remote attacker to exploit this vulnerability and gain root access on affected machines , or obtain root level access once local. ， A setuid version of v4rcp is shipped with RedHat Linux 6.2 , as part of a full install. It is possible to use this program , to obtain root level access. ， In addition , there are other buffer overruns present in the ksu and krshd sources from MIT. These problems will be remedied in the same release from MIT that fixes the krrb_rd_req (  ) vulnerability. ，  * ksux.c -- ksu exploit ，  * written January 26 , 2000 ，  * Jim Paris <jim @ jtan.com> ，  * This program exploits a vulnerability in the 'ksu' utility included ，  * with the MIT Kerberos distribution. Versions prior to 1.1.1 are ，  * vulnerable. ，  * This exploit is for Linux/x86 with Kerberos version 1.0. Exploits ，  * for other operating systems and versions of Kerberos should also work. ，  * Since krb5_parse_name will reject input with an @ or / , this shellcode ，  * execs 'sh' instead of '/bin/sh'. As a result , a copy of 'sh' must ，  * reside in the current directory for the exploit to work. ，  * /",
