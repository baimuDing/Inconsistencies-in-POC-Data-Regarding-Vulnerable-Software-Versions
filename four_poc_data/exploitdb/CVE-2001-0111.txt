    "text": "ecve : CVE-2001-0111 ， title : Debian 2.2 - splitvt Format String - Linux local Exploit ， verified : Verified ， exploit_detail : // source :  ， splitvt is a VT100 window splitter , designed to allow the user two command line interfaces in one terminal window , originally written by Sam Lantinga. It is freely available , open source , and included with many variants of the Linux Operating System. ， A problem in the program could allow for a format string attack. The problem occurs in the handling of format strings by the -rcfile command line flag. By placing shellcode in the $ HOME environment variable , and generating a custom crafted request to the splitvt program it is possible to overwrite variables on the stack , and arbitrarily execute code contained in the $ HOME environment variable. This makes it possible for a user with malicious motives to execute arbitrary code , and in implementations with the splitvt binary installed SUID root , gain administrative privileges. There are also various reported buffer overflows in the code. These have been addressed in the new release. ， / *  ，  * MasterSecuritY <www.mastersecurity.fr> ，  * spitvt.c - Local exploit for splitvt < 1.6.5 ，  * Copyright ( C ) 2001 fish stiqz <fish @ analog.org> ，  * Copyright ( C ) 2001 Michel \"MaXX\" Kaempf <maxx @ mastersecurity.fr> ，  * Updated versions of this exploit and the corresponding advisory will ，  * be made available at :  ，  * ftp : //maxx.via.ecp.fr/spitvt/ ，  * This program is free software ; you can redistribute it and/or modify ，  * it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by ，  * the Free Software Foundation ; either version 2 of the License , or ( at ，  * your option ) any later version. ，  * This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful ,  ，  * but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY ; without even the implied warranty of ，  * MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
