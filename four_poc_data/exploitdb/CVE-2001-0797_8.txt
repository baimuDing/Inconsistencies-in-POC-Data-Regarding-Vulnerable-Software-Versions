    "text": "ecve : CVE-2001-0797 ， title : Solaris 2.x/7.0/8 - Derived 'login' Remote Buffer Overflow - Solaris remote Exploit ， verified : Verified ， exploit_detail : source :  ， The 'login' program is used in UNIX systems to authenticate users with a username and password. The utility is typically invoked at the console , by 'telnetd' , 'rlogind' , and if configured to do so , SSH. ， Versions of 'login' descended from System V UNIX contain a buffer overflow when handling environment variables. Several operating systems such as Solaris/SunOS , HP-UX , AIX , IRIX , and Unixware contain vulnerable versions of 'login'. ， Unauthenticated clients can exploit this issue to execute arbitrary code as root. On systems where 'login' is installed setuid root , local attackers can elevate privileges. ，  #  ! /usr/bin/perl ，  # Date : 09/01/2003 ，  # Author : snooq [  ，  # I coded this script to demo how to login to a Solaris box without ，  # password as 'bin'. Nothing new , it's an old bug which dates back ，  # to Dec 2001. ，  # And , there are already several versions of exploits circulating ，  # in the wild for at least a year now. ，  # Due to uninformed/incompetent/ignorant sysadmins , there are still ，  # quite a number of vulnerable machines out there. ，  # 'root' remote login is not allowed by defaut. So , unless , it's ，  # a misconfigured box , you can only go as high as 'bin'. However ,  ，  # once you are dropped into a shell , further priviledge escalation is ，  # very possible. ，  # Background info ，  # =============== ，  # From ，  #  [ quote ]  ，  # The problem is there exists an authentication flag called the \"fflag\" ，  # just after the array that gets overflowed in the .bss segment. This is ，  # an array of char pointers so when it is overflowed because of an ，  # mismanagement on the indexing of this array the fflag gets overwritten ，  # with an valid address on .bss segment. this is good enough to satify ，  # the if ( fflag ) condition and spawn a shell. ，  #  [ /quote ]  ，  # For more info about this bug , go to :  ，  # Disclaimer ，  # ========== ，  # This is meant for you to do a quick check own your systems only. ，  # The author shall not be held responsible for any illegal use ，  # of this code. ，  # -> some asked 'why code another one?' ，  # I'm bored.. I guess.... been using other ppl's tools... it's time ，  # to write my own.. so that I have a reason to feel proud too... ，  # -> again , some asked 'why not in C?' ，  # ok... I'm lame.. my C sucks... my Perl sucks too... ，  # I'm not a professional programmer anyway... =p ，  # As usual , any comments or flames , go to jinyean at hotmail.com ， use Socket ;  ， use FileHandle ; ",
