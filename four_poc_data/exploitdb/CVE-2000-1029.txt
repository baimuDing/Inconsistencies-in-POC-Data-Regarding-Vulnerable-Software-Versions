In affected versions of host , if the AXFR query yields a response from the server which exceeds 512 bytes in length ( possible , since TCP DNS messages can be up to 65535 bytes in length )  , the response can overflow the relevant buffer onto the stack , allowing the return address of the function to be modified. This may allow an operator of a malicious nameserver to gain control of a system on which host is being run when a query is made. ， command line :  ， ./host -l -v -t any somezone.org <fake server> ， proof of concepts",
