It allows building operators to optimize and manage ，  # all of their building systems - including HVAC , lighting , fire , elevators ,  ，  # and security - all within a single HVAC controls platform. It's everything ，  # they need to keep occupants comfortable , manage energy conservation measures ,  ，  # identify key operational problems , and validate the results. ，  # Desc : WebCTRL suffers from an authenticated arbitrary code execution ，  # vulnerability. The issue is caused due to the improper verification ，  # when uploading Add-on ( .addons or .war ) files using the uploadwarfile ，  # servlet. This can be exploited to execute arbitrary code by uploading ，  # a malicious web archive file that will run automatically and can be ，  # accessed from within the webroot directory. Additionaly , an improper ，  # authorization access control occurs when using the 'anonymous' user. ，  # By specification , the anonymous user should not have permissions or ，  # authorization to upload or install add-ons. In this case , when using ，  # the anonymous user , an attacker is still able to upload a malicious ，  # file via insecure direct object reference and execute arbitrary code. ，  # The anonymous user was removed from version 6.5 of WebCTRL.",
