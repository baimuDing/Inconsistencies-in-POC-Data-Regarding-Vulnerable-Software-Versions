The overflow condition will be triggered and will cause smbd to overwrite sensitive areas of memory with attacker-supplied values. ， Note that the smbd service runs with root privileges. ，  * / ， sambash -- samba <= 2.2.7a reply_nttrans (  ) linux x86 remote root ， exploit by flatline @ blackhat.nl ， since we fully control a memcpy (  )  , our options are endless here. i've ， chosen to go the stack route tho ,  ， because any heap method would've required too much brute forcing or ， would've required the ugly use of targets. ， the stack method still requires little brute forcing and obviously ， will not survive PaX , but it's efficient. ， i'm using executable rets as a 'jmp sled' which jmp to the shellcode ， to help improve our brute forcing chances a bit. ， shouts to (  #  ) 0dd ,  #  ! l33tsecurity and #  ! xpc. ， many thanks to tcpdump which had to suffer the torture i put it ， through and often didn't survive ( more to come? ) . ， public/private , i don't give a shit.",
