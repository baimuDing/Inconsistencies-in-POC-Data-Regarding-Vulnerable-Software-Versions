In this instance , however , the IE5 browser has been fooled ( via http redirect to javascript ) into thinking that the Javascript should execute under the security context of the local host's security zone as the javascript was requested from a browser displaying the local file. ， Microsoft has released a FAQ that contains a good description of this vulnerability :  ， <SCRIPT> ， alert ( \"Create a short text file",
