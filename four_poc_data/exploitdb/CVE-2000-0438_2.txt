By supplying a large , well crafted buffer containing machine executable code in place of the mount point , it is possible for users in the 'floppy' group to execute arbitrary commands as root. ， This vulnerability exists in versions of S.u.S.E. , 4.0 and later , as well as Mandrake Linux 7.0. TurboLinux 6.0 and earlier ships with fdmount suid root , but users are not automatically added to the 'floppy' group. This list is by no means meant to be complete ; other Linux distributions may be affected. To check if you're affected , check for the presence of the setuid bit on the binary. If it is present , and the binary is either world executable , or group 'floppy' executable , you are affected and should take action immediately. ， / *  ， Welcome dear reader - be it scriptkiddy , whose sole intent it is to ， destroy precious old Unix boxes or Assembly Wizard whose sole intent = ， it ， is to correct my code and send me a flame. ， The fdutils package contains a setuid root file that is used by the = ， floppy ， group to mount and unmount floppies. If you are not in this group , = ， this ， exploit will not work. ， This thingy was tested on Slackware 4.0 and 7.0 ， Use as : fdmount-exp [ offset ]  [ buf size ]  [ valid text ptr ]  ， Since the char * text is overwritten in void errmsg ( char * text ) we = ， should ， make sure that this points to a valid address ( something in the .data ， section should do perfectly ) . The hard coded one used works on my = ， box ,  ， to find the one you need use something like :  ， objdump -disassemble-all $  ( whereis -b fdmount )  | grep \\<.data\\> \\ ， cut -d \" \" -f1 ， The HUGE number of nops is needed to make sure this exploit works. ， Since it Segfaults out of existence without removing /etc/mtab ~ we ， only get one try... ， Take care with your newly aquired EUID 0 !  ， Cheers go out to :  # phreak.nl # b0f # hit2000 # root66 ， The year 2000 scriptkiddie award goed to : Gerrie Mansur ， Love goes out to : Hester , Maja ( you're so cute !  )  , Dopey ， -- Yours truly ,  ， Scrippie - ronald @ grafix.nl - buffer0verfl0w security ， - # phreak.nl ，  * /",
