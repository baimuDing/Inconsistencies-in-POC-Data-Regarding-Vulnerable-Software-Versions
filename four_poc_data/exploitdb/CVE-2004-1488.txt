These issues are due to the application's failure to properly sanitize user-supplied input and to properly validate the presence of files before writing to them. The issues include :  ， - a potential directory-traversal issue ， - an arbitrary file-overwriting vulnerability ， - a weakness caused by the application's failure to filter potentially malicious characters from server-supplied input. ， Via a malicious server , an attacker may exploit these issues to arbitrarily overwrite files within the current directory and potentially outside of it. This may let the attacker corrupt files , cause a denial of service , and possibly launch further attacks against the affected computer. Overwriting of files would take place with the privileges of the user that activates the vulnerable application. ，  ) ^o-o^ | jabber : rdancer @ NJS.NetLab.Cz ，  | .v K e-mail : jjminar FastMail FM ， ` - .' phone : +44 ( 0 ) 7981 738 696 ， \\ __/Jan icq : 345 355 493 ， __ | o | __Min?? irc : rdancer @ IRC.FreeNode.Net ，  #  ! /usr/bin/perl -W ，  # wgettrap.poc -- A",
