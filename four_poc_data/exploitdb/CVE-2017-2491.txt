By triggering it , we can obtain a dangling pointer to a JSString object in a JavaScript callback. At first , the specific scenario seems very hard to exploit , but we found a rather generic technique to still get a reliable read/write primitive out of it , although it requires a very large (  ~ 28 GiB ) heap spray. This is possible even on a MacBook with 8 GB of RAM thanks to the page compression mechanism in macOS. ， -->",
