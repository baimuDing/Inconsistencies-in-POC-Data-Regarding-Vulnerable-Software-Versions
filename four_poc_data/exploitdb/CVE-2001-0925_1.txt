    "text": "ecve : CVE-2001-0925 ， title : Apache 1.3 - Artificially Long Slash Path Directory Listing ( 1 ) - Multiple remote Exploit ， verified : Verified ， exploit_detail : source :  ， Apache HTTPD is the Apache Web Server , freely distributed and actively maintained by the Apache Software Foundation. It is a freely available and widely used software package , included with various implementations of the UNIX operating system and can be used on Microsoft Windows operating systems. ， A problem in the package could allow directory indexing and path discovery. In a default configuration , Apache enables mod_dir , mod_autoindex , and mod_negotiation. However , by sending the Apache server a custom-crafted request consisting of a long path name created artificially by using numerous slashes , an attacker can cause these modules to misbehave , allowing the attacker to escape the error page and to gain a listing of the directory contents. ， This vulnerability allows a malicious remote user to launch an information-gathering attack , which could potentially result in a compromise of the system. Additionally , this vulnerability affects all releases of Apache previous to 1.3.19. ，  #  ! /usr/bin/perl ，  # orginal by farm9 , Inc.
