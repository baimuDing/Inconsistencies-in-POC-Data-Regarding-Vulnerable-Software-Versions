Tower's ， REST API and CLI make it easy to embed Tower into existing tools and processes. ， Tower now includes real-time output of playbook runs , an all-new dashboard and ， expanded out-of-the-box cloud support.\" ， source :  ， Business recommendation :  ， Attackers are able to elevate privileges and gain full control over Ansible ， Tower and therefore access to sensitive data of other customers. ， It is assumed that further vulnerabilities exist as only a short crash test has ， been performed. Therefore it is recommended to perform a thorough security ， review by security professionals. ， Vulnerability overview/description :  ， 1 ) Privilege Escalation ， Ansible Tower provides the feature to create multiple organizations inside ， one tower instance. Each organization can have an unlimited number of users ， and administrators which are only allowed to perform actions in the context ， of their own organization. Due to missing validation of the \"is_superuser\" ， parameter during user creation , organization admins can create superadmin ， accounts and therefore elevate their privileges to gain full control of ， Ansible Tower. ， 2 ) Reflected Cross-Site Scripting ， Several parts of the Ansible Tower API have been identified to be vulnerable ， against reflected XSS attacks which can be used by an attacker to steal user ， sessions. ， 3 ) Missing Websocket Authentication / Information Leakage ， The Ansible Tower UI uses Websockets to notify clients about recent events. ， This part of the application lacks authentication as well as authorization ,  ， leading to internal data about e.g. scheduled events , being leaked to ， unauthorized and/or unauthenticated users. ， Proof of concept :  ， 1 ) Privilege Escalation ( Org-Admin to Superadmin )  ， Using the following request , a user with administrative privileges limited to an ， organization , can create a superadmin account with access to all organizations :  ， > POST /api/v1/organizations/3/users/ HTTP/1.1 ， > Host :  $ host ， > Authorization : Token c3f03841403a17ed79753e057167a62144dae7df ， > X-Auth-Token : Token c3f03841403a17ed79753e057167a62144dae7df ， > {\"first_name\" : \"Org1admin_superuser\" , \"last_name\" : \"Org1admin_superuser\" ,  ， > \"email\" : \"Org1admin_superuser @ local.local\" , \"organization\" : 3 ,  ， > \"username\" : \"Org1admin_superuser\" , \"password\" : \"Org1admin_superuser\" ,  ， > \"password_confirm\" : \"Org1admin_superuser\" , \"is_superuser\" : \"true\" , \"ldap_user\" : \"\"} ， 2 ) Reflected Cross-Site Scripting ， The following URL parameters have been identified to be vulnerable against ， reflected cross-site scripting :  ，  * URL : /api/v1/credentials/ , ",
