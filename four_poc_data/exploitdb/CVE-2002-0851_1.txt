    "text": "ecve : CVE-2002-0851 ， title : ISDN4Linux 3.1 - IPPPD Device String SysLog Format String ( 1 ) - Linux local Exploit ， verified : Verified ， exploit_detail : // source :  ， isdn4linux is a freely available , open source package of isdn compatibility tools. It is available for Linux operating systems. ， isdn4linux contains a format string vulnerability in the ipppd utility. In some installations , this utility is installed with setuid root privileges. Exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to a local attacker executing code with administrative privileges. ， / *  ，  * GOBBLES-own-ipppd.c -- local root on SuSE 8.0 ，  * Random Defcon Quote :  ，  * \"Who hired Gary Coleman to play KF at defcon?\" ，  * -Anonymous ，  * ipppd is part of the isdn4linux-utils package and ，  * is part of the default install of many linux dists. ，  * It is installed suid root on suse 8.0 but can only ，  * be run by users in group \"dialout\". Luckily this ，  * is a default group that normal users get added to. ，  * Problem :  ，  * Classical syslog ( 3 ) formatstring problem. ，  * ipppd will log device strings in the following manner :  ，  * main.c :  ，  * ... ，  * syslog ( LOG_NOTICE , devstr )  ; // HARD TO SPOT BUG ，  * ... ，  * This code is normally only reached with a valid device string ，  * but if you feed ipppd a devicename that is >= 256 bytes it ，  * will merrily proceed to log this string using the faulty ，  * syslog ( 3 ) call. Subsequently handing over root access to the machine. ，  * GENERIC FORMATSTRING EXPLOITS ARE SUPER DUPER FUN ，  * We're surprised that format bugs are allowed in 7350linux , but no one ，  * is perfect. Finding format bugs is a difficult task , and should be left ，  * to the professionals. A little known fact -- Paul Vixie invented ，  * insecure programming. We wanted to get this bug squashed before some ，  * \"researcher\" from snosoft.com discovered it and tried to make some money ，  * off it. Help us in our mission to eliminate the existance of format bugs ，  * in code. ，  * Greets :  ，  * -Mark Litchfield , for helping make defcon happen. Thanks. ，  * -Blue Boar , for his brilliant input during the Defcon Ethics Roundtable ，  * Challenge ( the finest moment of defcon X )  ，  * -Dean Turner , who contrary to whatever might be said , GOBBLES is not ，  * afraid of. ，  * -Eric Hines of f8labs.com , congradulations on your promotion to stockboy ，  * at Circuit City. ，  * -dice , for continuing to support the blackhat world ( thanks for buying ，  * a turkey breakfast )  ，  * -stealth , for making fun of the super bug. ，  * -Brian McWilliams , for thinking he knows what's up. Hoser. ，  * Be careful using the Compaq TestDrive Servers -- researchers from SnoSoft ，  * have comprimised each and every one of those machines , and are rapidly ，  * stealing other warez developed on these machines. If you have also ，  * worked with your perl -e techniques on these machines , and discovered some ，  * locally exploitable stack overflows , your work may have been ripped off. ，  * KF , the defcon stage , much like information security , is not for you. ，  * Please , help liberate dvdman ! Let him go back to maintaining ，  * l33tsecurity.com , and stop raping his mind for less-than-minimum wage ;  ，  * skill displayed on l33tsecurity.com shows this man knows what's up and ，  * deserves to make a little more money , or return to the wild where he ，  * can hack freely. FREE DVDMAN !  @  #  !  @  #  ，  *  ( flashn has asked that the \"hack.se is a bunch of nazis\" statement from ，  * the defcon speech to be publically retracted and for an apology to be ，  * issued )  ，  * / ， / *  ，  * PROOF OF CONCEPT ON DEFAULT SuSE 8.0 INSTALL :  ，  *  $ ./GOBBLES-own-ipppd -t 0x806c864 ，  *  [  *  ] target @ 0x806c868 ，  *  [  *  ] shellcode @ 0xbfffffb5 ，  * sh-2.05 # id ，  * uid=0 ( root ) gid=100 ( users ) groups=100 ( users )  ，  * sh-2.05 #  ，  * /",
