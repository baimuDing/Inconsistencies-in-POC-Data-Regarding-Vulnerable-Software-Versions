The issue is present in the libical implementation , which was forked ， from upstream libical version 0.47. ， The issue can be triggered remotely , when an attacker sends an specially ， crafted calendar attachment and does not require user interaction. It ， might be used by a remote attacker to crash or gain remote code execution ， in the client system. ， This issue was initially reported by Brandon Perry here :  ， and fixed in libical upstream , but was never fixed in Thunderbird. ， X41 did not perform a full test or audit on the software. ， Product Description ， Thunderbird is a free and open source email , newsfeed , chat , and calendaring ， client , that's easy to set up and customize. ， Analysis ， A heap-based buffer overflow in icalvalue.c icalmemory_strdup_and_dequote (  )  ， can be triggered while parsing a calendar attachment containing a malformed ， or specially crafted string. ， {% highlight c %} ， static char * icalmemorystrdupanddequote ( const char * str )  ， char * out = ( char *  ) malloc ( sizeof ( char )  * strlen ( str ) + 1 )  ;  ， char * pout = out ;  ， // ... ， p++ ;  ， // ... ，  * pout = * p ;  ， {% endhighlight %} ， Bounds checking in `icalmemorystrdupanddequote (  ) can be bypassed when the ， inputp` ends with a backslash , which enables an attacker to read out of bounds ， of the input buffer and writing out of bounds of a heap-allocated output buffer. ， The issue manifests in several ways , including out of bounds read and write ,  ， null-pointer dereference and frequently leads to heap corruption. ， It is expected that an attacker can exploit this vulnerability to achieve ， remote code execution.",
