    "text": "ecve : CVE-2000-0074 ， title : PowerScripts PlusMail WebConsole 1.0 - Weak Authentication ( 3 ) - CGI remote Exploit ， verified : Verified ， exploit_detail : // source :  ， PowerScripts PlusMail Web Control Panel is a web-based administration suite for maintaining mailing lists , mail aliases , and web sites. It is reportedly possible to change the administrative username and password without knowing the current one , by passing the proper arguments to the plusmail script. After this has been accomplished , the web console allows a range of potentially destructive activities including changing of e-mail aliases , mailing lists , web site editing , and various other privileged tasks. This can be accomplished by submitting the argument \"new_login\" with the value \"reset password\" to the plusmail script ( typically /cgi-bin/plusmail ) . Other arguments the script expects are \"username\" , \"password\" and \"password1\" , where username equals the new login name , password and password1 contain matching passwords to set the new password to. ， The specific affected versions have not been determined , and the developer cannot be located. ， / *  ，  [ gH Security Advisory ]  ， software affected : PowerScripts PlusMail ， versions affected : All versions to current. ， discussion : Read report below. ，  * / ， / *  ，  [ gH-plus.c ]  ， title :  [ gH plusmail vulnerability ]  ， date : 01.20.2000 ， comments : plusmail is an extremely popular cgi-based administration ， tool that allows you to take control of your website ， with a graphical control panel interface. the password ， file , however , is set with permissions rw enabled ,  ， therefore granting the authority to change the password ， whenever's clever. ， the following code will detect the vulnerability and ， generate the required html to exploit. ， shouts : seven one nine. all of gH. www.mp3.com/category5. ， herf @ ghettophreaks.org for finding vulnerability. ，  [ Advisory Information ]  ， written by : mosthated of gH [ most @ pure-security.net ]  ， vulnerable : So far , any environment running Plusmail. ， report : Noticed plusmail running on multiple operating systems. ， The vulnerability lies in the web based tool , which ， now that is easily exploited , gives you \"ADVANCED CONTROL\" ， of a target website. Below is the code by ytcracker of gH ,  ， which demonstrates how easy it is to generate the html code ， which is executed by your web browser to compromise the ， target host. We have noticed this PlusMail program is widely ， used , but have yet to succeed in finding the main site for ， PlusMail to acknowledge the developers of the remote ， vulnerability. ， Most likely this will be ripped out during the online trading ,  ， because of script kids not likely this factual addition , but ， never the less , it will be expressed. This exploit was written ， to acknowledge security weaknesses , but in no way promotes web ， page defacments. If you further use this program to gain access ， to anything not normally accessable by yourself , meaning you ， script kids , then you are subject to be prosecuted and even get ， 10 years in prison. Is it honestly worth it to compile this program ， and randomly ./hack sites and deface them with this half way ， automatted program to put your nick & group on it? ， The answer is NO. gh/global hell.. Heard of us?? Seen us on TV?? ， Read about us?? Most likely.. We've changed and gained knowledge ， from the experience....Been there done that.. The world didn't ， believe that a group like this could completely go legit , the IT ， professionals figured we would retaliate against the fbi and the ， world was scared by misleading media articles about how we are ， terrorist and destructive teens. I ask the world now , who is helping ， who? Did the media find this vulnerability? Did the stereotypist ， who label us as \"cyber gang members\" find this vulnerability and allow ， networks around the world to be patched before so called \"destructive ， hackers\" gained access to them. Answer yet again , NO , we did , not you ， who falsely claim to be helping with security. Your defacements don't ， help anything , we thought it did before as well , now we realized that ， it does nothing positive. You stereotypists know nothing about gH , yet ， can write articles , you're wrong. You people think so much that you know ， so much about hackers. You know nothing , what you think you know , is ， wrong. What you don't know about us , the information is right under ， your nose , yet you still can't put your finger on it. Their are 2 sides ， to the so called \"hacking scene\" , you people should realize there will ， always be a good and a bad side to most matters. Don't exploit the ， fact that you don't know anything about the whole situation , just face ， the real fact , our knowledge could be a great help to all , why not ， accept us as normal people , not untrue off the wall assumptions. ， If you use programs like this to deface sites , think before you use ， this one , because we have been through the childish fights online ， and expressed our feelings , we are still where we started , from square ， one and would not have gone any farther , until we realized that what we ， were doing was stupid , pathetic , futureless and illegal. Choose ， your path wisely , either stop the script kiddie bullshit or get ， your door kicked in , you decide. ， fix : Move/rename the PlusMail directory as a temporary fix. ，  * /",
