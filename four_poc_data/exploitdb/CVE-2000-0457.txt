This is due to the .htr file extension being mapped to ISM.DLL ISAPI application which redirects .htr file requests to ISM.DLL. ISM.DLL removes the extraneous \"%20\" and replaces .htr with the proper filename extension and reveals the source of the file. This vulnerability is similar to a more recently discovered variant , BugTraq ID 1488. ， This action can only be performed if a .htr request has not been previously made or if ISM.DLL is loaded into memory for the first time. If an .htr request has already been made , a restart of the web server is necessary in order to perform another. ， approx 230 times ) .htr",
