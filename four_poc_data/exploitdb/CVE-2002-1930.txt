The vulnerability is due to insufficient bounds checking of usernames for SOCKS4 requests. ， When AN HTTPD acts as a SOCKS4 server , it handles user names in an unsafe manner. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending an overly long username as part of a SOCKS4 request. This may overflow a buffer used by AN HTTPD and cause the server to overwrite adjacent memory. Successful exploitation may , in turn , lead to the execution of arbitrary code as the AN HTTPD process. ， / * /////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////// ， AN HTTPD Version 1.41c SOCKS4 username buffer overflow exploit ， written by Kanatoko <anvil @ jumperz.net> ， /////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////// * /",
