    "text": "ecve : CVE-2000-1199 ， title : PostgreSQL 6.3.2/6.5.3 - Cleartext Passwords - Immunix local Exploit ， verified : Verified ， exploit_detail : source :  ， PostgreSQL is a free RDBMS that is released under a Berkeley style license. PostgreSQL stores passwords for database users in a binary file called pg_shadow. This file is readable by root and the postgres user. Unfortunately , these passwords are stored in cleartext form and can be obtained if a user with read access to the file runs strings on it. While this is only readable by root and the postgres user ( by default )  , it allows either one ( or whoever else has read access to the file ) to get the passwords for all databases and bypass authentication completely. ， SmellyCat : /var/postgres/data # strings pg_shadow ， someaccountname ， someaccountpassword ， anotheraccountname ， anotheraccountpassword ， SmellyCat : /var/postgres/data # ",
