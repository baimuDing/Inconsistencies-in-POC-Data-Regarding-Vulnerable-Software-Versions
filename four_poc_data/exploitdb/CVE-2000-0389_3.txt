These include MIT Kerberos 5 releases 1.0.x , 1.1 and 1.1.1 , MIT Kerberos 4 patch level 10 ( and , most likely , prior releases )  , and Cygnus KerbNet and Network Security ( CNS ) . The main source of problems is due to a buffer overflow in the krb_rd_req (  ) library function. This function is used by every application that supports Kerberos 4 authentication , including , but not limited to , kshrd , klogin , telnetd , ftpd , rkinitd , v4rcp and kpopd. Therefore , it is possible for a remote attacker to exploit this vulnerability and gain root access on affected machines , or obtain root level access once local. ， A setuid version of v4rcp is shipped with RedHat Linux 6.2 , as part of a full install. It is possible to use this program , to obtain root level access. ， In addition , there are other buffer overruns present in the ksu and krshd sources from MIT. These problems will be remedied in the same release from MIT that fixes the krrb_rd_req (  ) vulnerability. ，  * kshux.c -- krshd remote exploit ，  * written April 8 , 2000 ，  * Jim Paris <jim @ jtan.com> ，  * This program exploits a vulnerability in the 'krshd' daemon included ，  * with the MIT Kerberos distribution. All versions are apparently ，  * vulnerable. ，  * This exploit is for Linux/x86 with Kerberos version 1.0 , but you'll ，  * probably need a fair bit of coaxing to get it to work. ，  * And yes , it's ugly. I need to accept an incoming connection from the ，  * remote server , handle the fact that the overflow goes through two ，  * functions and a toupper (  )  , make sure that certain overwritten pointers ，  * on the remote host's stack are set to valid values so that a strlen ，  * call in krb425_conv_principal (  ) doesn't cause a segfault before we ，  * return into the shellcode , adjust the offset depending on the remote ，  * hostname to properly align things , etc etc. As a result , you'll ，  * probably have a hard time getting this to work -- it took a lot of ，  * hacking and hardcoded numbers to get this to work against my test ，  * systems. ，  * /",
