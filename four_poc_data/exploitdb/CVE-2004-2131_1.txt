    "text": "ecve : CVE-2004-2131 ， title : IBM Informix Dynamic Server 9.40/Informix Extended Parallel Server 8.40 - Multiple Vulnerabilities ( 1 ) - Unix local Exploit ， verified : Verified ， exploit_detail : source :  ， IBM Informix Dynamic Server and IBM Informix Extended Parallel Server have been reported prone to multiple vulnerabilities. ， The first issue exists in the onedcu binary. Specifically , when the binary is invoked a predictable temporary file is created. A local attacker may exploit this issue to launch symbolic link style attacks ultimately resulting in elevated privileges. ， The second issue that has been reported to exist in the ontape binary. The ontape binary has been reported to be prone to a local stack based buffer overflow vulnerability. Ultimately the attacker may exploit this condition to influence execution flow of the vulnerable binary into attacker-controlled memory. This may lead to the execution of arbitrary instructions with elevated privileges. ， A third issue has been reported to affect the onshowaudit binary. Specifically , the onshowaudit binary reads data from temporary files contained in the \"tmp? directory. These files have predictable filenames ; an attacker may exploit this issue to disclose data that may be used in further attacks launched against the vulnerable system. ，  #  ! ",
