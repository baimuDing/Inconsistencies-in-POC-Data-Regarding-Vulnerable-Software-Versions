    "text": "ecve : CVE-2001-1015 ， title : Snes9x 1.3 - Local Buffer Overflow - Unix local Exploit ， verified : Verified ， exploit_detail : // source :  ， Snes9x is a free Super Nintendo emulator that runs on a number of platforms. ， Snes9x is prone to a buffer overflow. This is due to improper bounds checking of rom names. In this case , 4089 characters are required to overwrite the EIP. If this buffer is overrun , it may be possible for a local attacker to execute arbitrary code on the host. This may be a security concern on some systems because Snes9x documentation suggests setting the utilities setuid root. ， Successful exploitation will lead to a full compromise of the host. ， It should be noted that packages distributed in SuSE Linux , NetBSD , OpenBSD , FreeBSD , Debian Linux and Progeny Linux are not installed setuid root by default so exploitation of the buffer overflow will not lead to a root compromise on these systems. ， / *  ，  * snes9x local root exploit",
