This provides several benefits to end users and organizations ,  ， including efficiency gains in the use of hardware resources , reduction ， of operational costs , dynamic re-allocation of computing resources and ， rapid deployment and configuration of software development and testing ， environments. ， VirtualBox is an open source virtualization technology project ， originally developed by Innotek , a software company based in Germany. ， In February 2008 Sun Microsystems announced the acquisition of Innotek ，  [ 1 ] and VirtualBox was integrated into Sun's xVM family of ， virtualization technologies. In May 2008 , Sun Microsystems announced ， that the number of downloads of the open source VirtualBox software ， package passed the five million mark [ 2 ] . ， When used on a Windows Host Operating System VirtualBox installs a ， kernel driver ( 'VBoxDrv.sys' ) to control virtualization of guest ， Operating Systems. ， An input validation vulnerability was discovered within VirtualBox's ， 'VBoxDrv.sys' driver that could allow an attacker , with local but ， un-privileged access to a host where VirtualBox is installed , to execute ， arbitrary code within the kernel of the Windows host operating system ， and to gain complete control of a vulnerable computer system. ，  * Vulnerable Packages *  ， . Sun xVM VirtualBox 1.6.2. ， . Sun xVM VirtualBox 1.6.0. ， . This issue only occurs in the Microsoft Windows versions of xVM ， VirtualBox. ，  * Non-vulnerable Packages *  ， . Sun xVM VirtualBox 1.6.4 ( for Microsoft Windows )  ，  * Vendor Information , Solutions and Workarounds *  ， No workarounds exist for this issue. A security bulletin from the vendor ， that describes this issue is available here :  ，  * Credits *  ， This vulnerability was discovered and researched by Anibal Sacco from ， the CORE IMPACT Exploit Writing Team ( EWT ) at Core Security Technologies.",
