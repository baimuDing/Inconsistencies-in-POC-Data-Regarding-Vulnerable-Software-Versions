    "text": "ecve : CVE-2004-1701 ， title : GNU CFEngine 2.0.x/2.1 - AuthenticationDialogue Remote Heap Buffer Overrun ( 1 ) - Linux dos Exploit ， verified : Verified ， exploit_detail : source :  ， GNU cfengine cfservd is reported prone to a remote heap-based buffer overrun vulnerability. The vulnerability presents itself in the cfengine cfservd AuthenticationDialogue (  ) function. ， The issue exists due to a lack of sufficient boundary checks performed on challenge data that is received from a client. ， Because the size of the buffer , the size of data copied in a memcpy (  ) operation , and the data copied are all controlled by the attacker , a remote attacker may likely exploit this condition to corrupt in-line heap based memory management data. ， cfservd employs an IP based access control method. This access control must be bypassed prior to exploitation. This may hinder exploitation attempts. ， This vulnerability is reported to affect versions 2.0.0 to 2.1.7p1 of cfengine cfservd.",
