As part of the installation process , the 'lit' program is run. This program insecurely creates files in /var/tmp. This can be used to create files owned by root , with known contents. The file will be created with root's umask , which by default is 0022. ， Lit is not part of Globetrotter's FlexLM distribution. It is a license installation tool supplied by Sun for convenience purposes. This vulnerability does not represent a vulnerability in lmgrd , but a flaw in the license installation process. Running lmgrd as a user other than root , while a good idea , will not eliminate this problem. ， ln -sf /.rhost /var/tmp/license_errors",
