    "text": "ecve : CVE-2001-0333 ， title : Microsoft IIS 3.0/4.0/5.0 - PWS Escaped Characters Decoding Command Execution ( 2 ) - Windows remote Exploit ， verified : Verified ， exploit_detail : // source :  ， Due to a flaw in the handling of CGI filename program requests , remote users can execute arbitrary commands on an IIS host. ， When IIS receives a CGI filename request , it automatically performs two actions before completing the request :  ， 1. IIS decodes the filename to determine the filetype and the legitimacy of the file. IIS then carries out a security check. ， 2. When the security check is completed , IIS decodes CGI parameters. ， A flaw in IIS involves a third undocumented action : Typically , IIS decodes only the CGI parameter at this point , yet the previously decoded CGI filename is mistakenly decoded twice. If a malformed filename is submitted and circumvents the initial security check , the undocumented procedure will decode the malformed request , possibly allowing the execution of arbitrary commands. ， Note that arbitrary commands will be run with the IUSR_machinename account privileges. Reportedly , various encoding combinations under Windows 2000 Server and Professional may yield different outcomes. ， Personal Web Server 1.0 and 3.0 are reported vulnerable to this issue. ， The worm Nimda ( and variants ) actively exploit this vulnerability. ， / * IISEX by HuXfLuX <huxflux2001 @ hotmail.com>. IIS CGI File Decode Bug ， exploit. Written 16-05-2001. ， Compiles on Linux , works with IIS versions 3 , 4 and 5.
