    "text": "ecve : CVE-2001-0766 ， title : Apache 1.3.14 - Mac File Protection Bypass - OSX remote Exploit ， verified : Verified ， exploit_detail : source :  ， A vulnerability exists when Apache webserver is used with Mac OS X Client. ， The standard filesystem for Mac OS X is HFS+. HFS+ is case insensitive while Apache's filtering is case sensitive. The result is that Apache will filter all file requests that match filters exactly ( including case )  , but it will not filter requests made with mixed or upper case characters. Since HFS+ is case insensitive , these requests will result in the \"filtered\" files being disclosed. ， The impact is that arbitrary privileged files may be disclosed to unprivileged remote users. ， The following request will result in a 403 Forbidden as excpected :  ， GET /test/index.html ， But the following request will happily serve the file :  ， GET /TeSt/index.html",
