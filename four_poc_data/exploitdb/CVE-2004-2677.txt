While coding this exploit , I found just two ， \"problems\". The first is that our buffer is only 32 bytes long and the second is that ， qwik-smtpd filters spaces chars with the isspace (  )  , this way our 0x0b code used in the ， shellcode is filtered. To circumvent the first problem I divided the exploit in two ， stages. The first one overwrite the LSW of the exit (  ) GOT entry and the second overwrite ， the MSW. Then , we send an EXIT command forcing the qwik-smtpd to jump into our shellcode. ， The second problem was \"fixed\" using another char ( 0x10 ) and then decrementing it before ， calling the int 0x80 syscall. ， Notes :  ， You MUST enter your external IP Address ( when attacking remotely ) or 127.0.0.1 ( when ， attacking locally ) cause its IP is",
