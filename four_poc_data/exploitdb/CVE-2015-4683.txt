Freingruber , C.A. ( Office Vienna )  ， SEC Consult Vulnerability Lab ， An integrated part of SEC Consult ， Berlin - Frankfurt/Main - Montreal - Singapore ， Vienna ( HQ ) - Vilnius - Zurich ， Vendor description :  ， - ------------------- ， \"A key component of the Polycom RealPresence Platform , available as a hardened ， appliance or software optimized for virtualized environments , the RealPresence ， Resource Manager application is critical to effectively managing thousands of ， mobile , desktop , and group telepresence systems.\" ， Business recommendation :  ， - ------------------------ ， By combining all vulnerabilities documented in this advisory an unprivileged ， authenticated remote attacker can gain full system access ( root ) on the RPRM ， appliance. This has an impact on all conferences taking place via this RP ， Resource Manager. Attackers can steal all conference passcodes and join or ， record any conference. ， SEC Consult recommends not to use this system until a thorough security review ， has been performed by security professionals and all identified issues have ， been resolved. ， Vulnerability overview/description :  ， - ----------------------------------- ， 1 ) Unauthorized plaintext password disclosure of RMX admin accounts ， The RPRM discloses the plaintext password of the RMX admin user to an ， unauthorized unprivileged attacker by including it in certain HTTP responses. ， No manipulation of parameters is required. ， 2 ) Arbitrary file disclosure ( I ) via path traversal ( CVE-2015-4684 )  ， Ordinary unprivileged users can download an Excel file of all their upcoming ， conferences. This functionality can be exploited by an authenticated attacker ， to download arbitrary files from the server due to insufficient input validation. ， There is no restriction on which files might be downloaded since this action ， is performed with root privileges. ， 3 ) Plaintext passwords stored in logfiles ， RPRM generates logdata which includes plaintext passwords. This weakness in ， combination with the previous vulnerability allows an unprivileged attacker ， to escalate his privileges to the admin level in the web interface. ， 4 ) Arbitrary file upload via path traversal ( CVE-2015-4684 )  ， This vulnerability requires admin privileges in the web interface , but combining ， all previous vulnerabilities in this advisory allows privilege escalation. ， Administrators can",
