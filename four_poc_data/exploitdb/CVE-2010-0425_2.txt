At worst , if DEP is enabled for the Apache process , you could cause ，  * a constant DoS by looping this ( since apache will automatically restart )  :  )  ，  * Note that the exploit code may need to be run multiple times before a shell is spawned ( 70% ，  * success rate - tested on three different systems ) . Furthermore , the exploit code may require ，  * modification to exploit this vulnerability on different platforms. This is due to loaded memory ，  * references to the unloaded DLL ( they will be different for each ISAPI module ) . Do not test ，  * this code in a VM otherwise the code may fail to send the RESET packet ( something to do with ，  * VMware gracefully closing the connection , instead of sending a RESET packet ) - I didnt want ，  * to have to use raw packets on Windows. ，  * Shellcode Note :  ，  * The shellcode writes \"pwn-isapi\" to \"sos.txt\" which is created in the current working directory. ，  * Most operating systems should be supported by this shellcode. I've used Skylined's method of finding ，  * the base address of kernel32.dll for Windows 7 and modified it so that it will find the base ，  * address of msvcrt.dll instead. I've also added another check so that it will be able to detect ，  * \"msvcrt.dll\" on Windows Server 2003 ( this OS loads msvcrt.dll in 5th position , and before this ，  * DLL string is read , another DLL ( RPCRT4.dll ) length is verifiied which matches the length of ，  * msvcrt.dll. So the added check will verify the presents of \"m\" before proceeding. ，  * Author :  ，  * Brett Gervasoni ( brettg [ at ] senseofsecurity.com.au )  ，  * Copyright Sense of Security Pty Ltd 2010. ，  * /",
