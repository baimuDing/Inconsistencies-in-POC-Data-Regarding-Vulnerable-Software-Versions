    "text": "ecve : CVE-1999-0005 ， title : Netscape Messaging Server 3.55 & University of Washington imapd 10.234 - Remote Buffer Overflow - Linux remote Exploit ， verified : Verified ， exploit_detail : // source :  ， A vulnerability exists in certain imapd implementations that allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code remotely. In certain instances , the code to be executed will be run with root privilege. ， Imap supports a command 'AUTHENTICATE' which specifies the type of authentication mechanism to be used to open a mailbox. The value passed to the authenticate command is copied into a buffer of size 1024. The maximum size of this value , however , it 8192 characters. A failure to bound the read value to 1024 results in a buffer overflow. ， The code which creates this problem is as follows :  ， char * mail_auth ( char * mechanism , authresponse_t resp , int argc , char * argv [  ]  )  ， char tmp [ MAILTMPLEN ]  ;  ， AUTHENTICATOR * auth ;  ， / * make upper case copy of mechanism name * / ， ucase ( strcpy ( tmp , mechanism )  )  ;  ， The 'strcpy' command on the sixth line of code will copy the value of 'mechanism' , which is up to 8192 characters in to the 'tmp' buffer , which is only 1024 characters. ， All versions of UW imapd up to , and including 10.234 should be considered vulnerable. ， i386 BSD remote root exploit for UW imapd IMAP 4.1 server ， This is * not * the same bug addressed in CERT Advisory CA-97.09 !  ， Usage : % ( imappy nop esp offset ; cat )  | nc hostname 143 ， where nop is the number of NOP opcodes to place at the start of the ， exploit buffer ( I use 403 )  , esp is the %esp stack pointer value , and ， offset is the number of bytes to add to esp to calculate your target ， %eip. ， Demonstration values for UW imapd 10.234 ( part of Pine 4.00 )  :  ， imappy 403 0xefbfd5e8 100 ( BSDI 3.0 )  ， imappy 403 0xefbfd4b8 100 ( FreeBSD 2.2.5 )  ， THIS CODE FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY IN AN ETHICAL MANNER ， Cheez Whiz ， cheezbeast @ hotmail.com ， July 16 , 1998",
