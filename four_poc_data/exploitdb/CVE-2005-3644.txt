    "text": "ecve : CVE-2005-3644 ， title : Microsoft Windows Server 2000 - UPNP 'getdevicelist' Memory Leak Denial of Service - Windows dos Exploit ， verified : Verified ， exploit_detail : / *  ，  * Author : Winny Thomas ，  * Nevis Labs , Pune , INDIA ，  * Details :  ，  * While working on the exploit for MS05-047 i came across a condition where ，  * a specially crafted request to upnp_getdevicelist would cause ，  * services.exe to consume memory to a point where the target machines virtual ，  * memory gets exhausted. This exploit is NOT similar to the MS05-047 exploit i ，  * published earlier. The earlier one trashed the EIP of the target causing a ，  * crash in services.exe and eventually brought down the system to shut down. ，  * However in this exploit ( again a DOS ) the virtual memory is consumed to a ，  * point where desktop requests ( like clicking \"My Computer\" )  , HTTP requests ,  ，  * SMB requests etc does not get serviced for sometime. After sometime the ，  * memory usage comes down and the target system would work as normal. However ，  * this code when continuosly executed against a target leads to a sustained ，  * DOS attack. ，  * Start the task manager on the target system and run this code against the ，  * target and watch the virtual memory usage shoot up. ，  * I used windbg to break on calls to upnp_getdevicelist when running this code. ，  * However even before the break point is hit the system becomes unresponsive. ，  * Strangely though changing the operation number in the DCERPC request to ，  * something else other than 0xa ( upnp_getdevicelist ) will make the DOS attempt ，  * fail. Perhaps changing the payload a little bit , so that the underlying ，  * demarshalling routines dont return an error , might",
