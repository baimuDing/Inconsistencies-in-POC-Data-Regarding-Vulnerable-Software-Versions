When run setuid root or setgid kmem , it is subject to a buffer overflow that can lead to regular users gaining root priveleges. ， / *  ，  * Sekure SDI ( Brazilian Information Security Team )  ，  * lsof local exploit for linux ，  * by c0nd0r <condor @ sekure.org> ，  * Security problem found by HERT. ( www.hert.org )  ，  * -> This little tool will bring you a suid or sgid shell owned by lsof ，  * user ( root | kmem usually ) at /tmp directory ( /tmp/sh ) . ，  * ----------------------------------------------------------------------- ，  * Code explanation : We've used a unsual technique here. ，  * The buffer allocated was too small for the standard expl , so we did a ，  * little trick , by overflowing with 'A' till reaching the ret address and ，  * then we've filled with NOP and the shellcode just after the modified ，  * ret address. So we have a different exploit architeture :  ，  *  [ garbage ]  [ eip modified ]  [ lotsa NOP's ]  [ shellcode ]  ，  * That's why we need a bigger offset. ，  * ----------------------------------------------------------------------- ，  * usage ( needa have a little brain )  :  ，  * ./SDI-lsof <offset> ( between 373-505 )  ，  * 4 phun - ，  * Thanks to jamez , dumped , bishop , bahamas , slide , falcon , vader ，  * and guys at # uground ( irc.brasnet.org network )  ，  * / ， / * change the lsof path if it's needed * /",
