This makes it possible ， to inject arbitary objects into the scope. ， Details :  ， CakePHP uses the following function in the Security component ， to protect against XSRF attacks with POST Requests :  ， -- snip -- ，  $ check = $ controller->data ;  ，  $ token = urldecode (  $ check [ '_Token' ]  [ 'fields' ]  )  ;  ， list (  $ token ,  $ locked ) = explode ( ' : ' ,  $ token , 2 )  ;  ，  $ locked = unserialize ( str_rot13 (  $ locked )  )  ;  ， -- snip -- ， The $ check array contains our POST data and $ locked is ， a simple ( rot-13 obfuscated ) serialized string , which is completely ， under our control. ， PHP5 introduces a destructor with the \"__destruct\" method. Each object ， will execute its __destruct method at the end of its lifetime and we can ， use this to turn an unchecked unserialize (  ) call in an useful exploit. ，  ( See Stefan Essers talk @  ， CakePHP defines the App Class with the following destruct method :  ，  $ core = App :  : core ( 'cake' )  ;  ， unset (  $ this->__paths [ rtrim (  $ core [ 0 ]  , DS )  ]  )  ;  ， Cache :  : write ( 'dir_map' , array_filter (  $ this->__paths )  ,  ， '_cake_core_' )  ;  ， Cache :  : write ( 'file_map' , array_filter (  $ this->__map )  ,  ， '_cake_core_' )  ;  ， Cache :  : write ( 'object_map' ,  $ this->__objects , '_cake_core_' )  ;  ， As we can see , this method can be abused by an manipulated object to write ， arbitary values into the _cake_core Cache. ， The most interesting key to corrupt is the file_map. It provides the ， mapping between Classes and PHP Files and is used to load additional ， Classes at runtime. ， The real code for the loading of",
