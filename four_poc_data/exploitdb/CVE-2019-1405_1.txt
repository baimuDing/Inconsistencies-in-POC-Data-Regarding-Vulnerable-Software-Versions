Run COMahawk.exe ， 2. ??? ， 3. Hopefully profit ， or ， 1. COMahawk.exe \"custom command to run\" ( ie. COMahawk.exe \"net user /add test123 lol123 &\" )  ， 2. ??? ， 3. Hopefully profit ， Concerns ， MSDN mentioned that only 1803 to 1903 is vulnerable to CVE-2019-1322. If it doesn't work , maybe it was patched. ， However , it is confirmed that my 1903 does indeed have this bug so maybe it was introduced somewhere inbetween. YMMV. ， Also , since you are executing from a service - you most likely cannot spawn any Window hence all command will be \"GUI-less\". Maybe different session? Idk , it is too late and I am tired haha.",
