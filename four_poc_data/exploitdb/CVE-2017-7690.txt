    "text": "ecve : CVE-2017-7690 ， title : Proxifier for Mac 2.19 - Local Privilege Escalation - macOS local Exploit ， verified : Not Verified ， exploit_detail :  # With CVE-2017-7643 I disclosed a command injection vulnerablity in the KLoader ，  # binary that ships with Proxifier <= 2.18. ，  # Unfortunately 2.19 is also vulnerable to a slightly different attack that ，  # yields the same result. ，  # When Proxifier is first run , if the KLoader binary is not suid root it gets ，  # executed as root by Proxifier.app ( the user is prompted to enter an admin ，  # password ) . The KLoader binary will then make itself suid root so that it ，  # doesn't need to prompt the user again. ，  # The Proxifier developers added parameter sanitisation and kext signature ，  # verification to the KLoader binary as a fix for CVE-2017-7643 but Proxifier.app ，  # does no verification of the KLoader binary that gets executed as root. ，  # The directory KLoader sits in is not root-owned so we can replace it with ，  # our own binary that will get executed as root when Proxifier starts. ，  # To avoid raising any suspicion , as soon we get executed as root we can swap ，  # the real KLoader binary back into place and forward the execution call on ，  # to it. It does require the user to re-enter their credentials the next time ，  # Proxifier is run but it's likely most users wouldn't think anything of this. ，  # Users should upgrade to version 2.19.2. ，  # 3e30f1c7ea213e0ae1f4046e1209124ee79a5bec479fa23d0b2143f9725547ac ，  # ------------------------------------------------------------------- ，  #  !
