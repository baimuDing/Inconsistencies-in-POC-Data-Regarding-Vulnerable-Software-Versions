This allows the attacker to login as user 'dbuser' using ， the hardcoded password , and due to an old Linux kernel version used - escalate privilages ， through several vulnerabilities and eventually take the full control over the device. ， Additionally - the web interface advices the user to reset the admin password for security reasons ,  ， but the RView application still uses the hardcoded password in order to create the SSH tunnel which ， may result in a false sense of security.",
