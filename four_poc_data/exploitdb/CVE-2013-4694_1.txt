ADVISORY INFORMATION ， Product : WinAmp ， Vendor URL : www.winamp.com ， Type : Stack-based Buffer Overflow [ CWE-121 ]  ， Date found : 2013-06-05 ， Date published : 2013-07-01 ， CVSSv2 Score : Bug # 1 : 7 , 5 ( AV : N/AC : L/Au : N/C : P/I : P/A : P )  ， Bug # 2 : 3 , 7 ( AV : L/AC : H/Au : N/C : P/I : P/A : P )  ， CVE : CVE-2013-4694 ， 2. CREDITS ， These vulnerabilities were discovered and researched by Julien Ahrens ， from Inshell Security. ， 3. VERSIONS AFFECTED ， WinAmp v5.63 , older versions may be affected too. ， 4. VULNERABILITY DESCRIPTION ( BUG # 1 )  ， The application loads the directories in %PROGRAMFILES%\\WinAmp\\Skins on ， startup to determine the skins that have been installed and to list them ， in the application menu point \"Skins\" and in the Skins Browser. But the ， application does not properly validate the length of the directory name ， before passing it as argument to a lstrcpynW call in the library ， gen_jumpex.dll , which leads to a buffer overflow condition with possible ， code execution. ， This flaw is also exploitable via the %APPDATA%\\WinAmp\\winamp.ini. The ， application loads the contents on startup , but does not properly ， validate the length of the string loaded from the \"skin\" key before ， passing it as an argument to the same lstrcpynW call in the library ， gen_jumpex.dll , which leads to the same buffer overflow condition. ， An attacker either needs to trick the victim to download and apply an ， arbitrary skin package in order to exploit the vulnerability or to copy ， an arbitrary winamp.ini into the %APPDATA%\\WinAmp directory. Successful ， exploits can allow attackers to execute arbitrary code with the ， privileges of the user running the application. Failed exploits will ， result in a denial-of-service condition. ， 4. VULNERABILITY DESCRIPTION ( BUG # 2 )  ， The application loads the string of the GUI \"Search\" field from the ， \"WinAmp Library\" when entered by a user and after switching to another ， menu point , but does not properly validate the length of the string ， before passing it as an argument to a GetDlgItemTextW call in the ， library ml_local.dll , which leads to a buffer overflow condition with ， possible code execution. ， An attacker needs local access to the client in order to exploit the ， vulnerability. Successful exploits can allow attackers to execute ， arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the application. ， Failed exploits will result in a denial-of-service condition. ， 5.
