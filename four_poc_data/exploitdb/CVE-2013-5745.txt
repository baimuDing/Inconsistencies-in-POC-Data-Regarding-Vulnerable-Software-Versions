The vulnerability is triggered when a VNC client , who ， claims to only support protocol version 3.3 , sends malformed data during ， the authentication selection stage of the authentication process. ， If this process is repeated more than just a couple times , it causes Vino ， VNC server to fall into what appears to be an infinite loop , as seen in the ， service logs via repeating \"Authentication deferred - ignoring client ， message\" messages. This not only affects the connecting client IP , but ， affects service level availability for all potential VNC clients and the ， service fails to handle any new VNC client requests regardless of client ， IP. ， The Vino VNC server must be restarted in order to restore VNC service ， availability. ， Additionally , after the failure condition has occurred , the log file ，  (  ~ /.xsession-errors ) grows quickly to 1GB within 4min in testing. If left ， unattended in the failure state , a system wide denial of service due to ， file system consumption is possible. ， Example :  ， The following",
