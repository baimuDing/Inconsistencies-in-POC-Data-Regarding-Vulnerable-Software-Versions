    "text": "ecve : CVE-2000-0919 ， title : phpix 1.0 - Directory Traversal - PHP webapps Exploit ， verified : Verified ， exploit_detail : source :  ， PHPix is a web-based photo-album system written in PHP. It is vulnerable to an attack that allows a malicious remote user to view arbitrary files on the target webserver with the privileges of the webserver. The problem is that \"../\" character sequences can be supplied by the user in an http variable that is used to reference a file on the webservers filesystem. As a result , the attacker can construct a path relative to the current working directory of the webserver using \"..\"'s and then the target filename/path to read any readable ( to the uid of the httpd process ) file on the filesystem. The information gained may make it easier to compromise the system in other ways. ， Example :  ， The above line if given will output all the directories that are nested within /etc ， directory. Other more sinister content can be revealed from there.",
