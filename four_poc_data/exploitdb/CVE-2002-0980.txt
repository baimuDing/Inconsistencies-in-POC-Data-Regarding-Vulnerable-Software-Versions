    "text": "ecve : CVE-2002-0980 ， title : Microsoft Outlook Express 5/6 - MHTML URL Handler File Rendering - Windows remote Exploit ， verified : Verified ， exploit_detail : source :  ， Microsoft Outlook Express introduced a URL handler called MHTML ( MIME Encapsulation of Aggregate HTML ) . This allows Internet Explorer to pass MHTML files to Outlook Express for rendering. ， The MHTML URL handler does not validate the file type it is rendering. This could allow a file type that is normally considered to be a \"safe file type\" , such as a .txt file , to be opened and have any script contained within rendered. This script would then be rendered in the Local Computer Zone.",
