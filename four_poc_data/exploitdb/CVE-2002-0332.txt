It may be used to transmit terminal messages between users and machines. xtell is available for Linux , BSD and most other Unix based operating systems. ， Multiple buffer overflow vulnerabilities have been reported in some versions of xtell. If long strings are recieved by the xtell client , stack memory will be overwritten. Exploitation of these vulnerabilities may result in arbitrary code being executed as the xtell daemon. ， Overflow conditions may be caused if long strings are sent by a malicious DNS server in response to the reverse lookup performed when a message is received , either through the auth string returned by the ident server , or through directly sending an overly long message to the vulnerable user. ， Earlier versions of xtell may share some or all of these vulnerabilities. This has not been confirmed.",
