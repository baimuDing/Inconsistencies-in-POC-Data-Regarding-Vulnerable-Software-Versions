The vulnerability can also be used to deny availability of the ， system. As an example , this advisory shows the compromise of the ， server's certificate and private key. ， Details ， Product : MobileTogether Server ， Affected Versions : 7.0-7.3 , potentially earlier versions as well ， Fixed Versions : 7.3 SP1 ， Vulnerability Type : XML External and Exponential Entity Expansion ， Security Risk : medium ， Vendor URL :  ， Vendor Status : fixed version released ， Advisory URL :  ， Advisory Status : published ， CVE : CVE-2021-37425 ， CVE URL :  ， Introduction ， \"MobileTogether Server is the processing powerhouse for your native iOS ,  ， Android , Windows , and browser-based apps. ， MobileTogether Server is the back-end hub for your solutions and acts as ， a gateway between end-users and your back-end data sources and ， infrastructure.\" ，  ( from the vendor's homepage )  ， More Details ， MobileTogether Server is a back-end application hosting developed apps ， and provide access to various platforms and devices. Access to these ， apps is possible via native applications for devices and operating ， systems or directly via the browser. To access the MobileTogether ， server , depending on configuration either an anonymous login is possible ， or credentials are required. ， During analysis of the communication between a MobileTogether client ， application on a smartphone and the MobileTogether Server , HTTP requests ， were observed containing JSON as well as XML data. Generally , the XML ， data is used to signal changes in the UI or user-supplied input for the ， app hosted in MobileTogether Server. ， It was found that user-supplied XML external entities included in the ， described HTTP requests are resolved by the MobileTogether Server and ， the result is reflected in an HTTP response. ， This behaviour allows to read local files , perform server-side requests ， and also deny the availability of the service through XML exponential ， entity expansion. However , file disclosure is limited to non-binary ， files and the absolute path needs to be known in advance.",
