    "text": "ecve : CVE-2000-0904 ， title : QSSL Voyager 2.0 1B - '.photon' Directory Information Disclosure - Multiple remote Exploit ， verified : Verified ， exploit_detail : source :  ， The web server supplied with the QNX Voyager demo disk contains several vulnerabilities. ， First , Voyager will follow relative paths passed to it in requests. This includes ../ style paths , which will allow Voyager to serve pages outside of the \"document root\". ， Another vulnerability is that the web server does not have sufficient security restrictions - this means that the web server can access any file , including protected files and special /dev entries. ， As well , due to the integration of the web browser and web server , information used by the Photon GUI is easily exposed by requesting files under /.photon/. Additionally , html files generated by the web browser ( error messages , for example ) and the QNX configuration interface share the same directory as published html files. ， While the Voyager web server is not intended to be used in a production environment , and is in fact intended only to be a demo of the QNX OS , users should be aware of these design errors. ，  [ Revealing ] URLS include... ， The web client's settings file ， Recently visited sites ， The list of book-marked sites ， The Photon Window Manager menu listing ( Equivalent to MS Windows' 'start ， menu' )  ，  [ Modem build only ] ",
