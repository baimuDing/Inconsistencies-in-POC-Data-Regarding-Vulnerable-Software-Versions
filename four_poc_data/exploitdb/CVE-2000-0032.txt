    "text": "ecve : CVE-2000-0032 ， title : Solaris 7.0 - DMI Denial of Service - Solaris dos Exploit ， verified : Verified ， exploit_detail : source :  ， DMI is the Desktop Management Interface , and is a suite of application management programs shipped with Sun's Solaris. Each application that is managed through DMI has a MIF record ( which contains information about its managable components and properties ) that can be inserted into the MIF database ( /var/dmi/db ) through the dmisp ( DMI Service Providor ) daemon. There is no authentication performed on who submits new MIFs , meaning anybody can do it. This creates two possible denial of service conditions. The first is consumption of disk space in /var. There are no limits ( set by default ) on how much space the DMI database can use. This may be used in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to prevent logging , etc. A second vulnerability is a buffer overflow condition in dmispd when MIFs are a certain size. It may be exploitable beyond being a simple denial of service ( it may be possible to execute arbitrary code as root remotely ) . ， Buffer Overflow Crash : ",
