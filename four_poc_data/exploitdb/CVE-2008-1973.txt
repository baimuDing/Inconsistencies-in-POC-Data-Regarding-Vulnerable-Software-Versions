It does not perform any boundery checks ，  | on supplied subtitles. This causes buffer overrun and ，  | throwing access violation exception on group of instructions :  ，  | 005F7C1E | . 8902 MOV DWORD PTR DS :  [ EDX ]  , EAX ，  | 005F7C20 | . 8950 04 MOV DWORD PTR DS :  [ EAX+4 ]  , EDX ，  | I thought in first moment that this is heap overflow , but ，  | why does these instructions appear in subedit module? And ，  | why on my winxp sp2 computer this is possible? So , I think ，  | that this program has own kind of dynamically list structure ，  | and I am able to overwrite its pointers. ，  | Ok so , I am controling EAX and EDX registers. In this ，  | situation I am able to use technique described by c0ntex ，  |  ( thx mate !  ) to overwrite a pointer to RtlEnterCriticalSection ，  | in PEB structure of ntdll. Thanks to this ( after about 30 ，  | access violations when writing - exceptions handlers throw ，  | exceptions handlers )  ，  | I get :  ，  | {Access violation when executing [ 42424242 ] } ，  | -",
