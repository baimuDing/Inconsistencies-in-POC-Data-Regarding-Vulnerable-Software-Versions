By sending a maliciously crafted XDMCP message , it is possible for a remote attacker to execute arbitrary commands as root on the susceptible machine. The problem lies in the handling of the display information sent as part of an XDMCP 'FORWARD_QUERY' request. ， By default , gdm is not configured to listen via XDMCP. The versions of gdm shipped with RedHat 6.0-6.2 , Helix GNOME and gdm built from source are not vulnerable unless they were configured to accept XDMCP requests. This is configured via the /etc/X11/gdm/gdm.conf on some systems , although this file may vary. If the \"Enable\" variable is set to 0 , you are not susceptible. ， / *  ，  * breakgdm.c - Chris Evans ，  * /",
