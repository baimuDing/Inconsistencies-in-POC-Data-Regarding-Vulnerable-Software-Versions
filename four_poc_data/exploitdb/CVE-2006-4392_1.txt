Exception handlers however remain installed ,  ，  * and when some kind of hardware exception occurs , the exception handler can ，  * receive a new right to the task port as one of its arguments , and thus ，  * regain full control over the process. ，  * Interestingly , the code to reset the exception handlers ( and hence thwart ，  * this attack ) upon exec (  ) of a setuid executable has been present in the ，  * kernel since OSX 10.3 , but is disabled (  # if 0 ) for unspecified reasons. ，  * This exploit installs an exception handler on illegal memory access , forks ，  * off a child ( the handler is inherited )  , and uses RLIMIT_STACK to cause a ，  * segfault after exec (  ) . The shell code invokes /usr/bin/id. ，  * Greetings to Scrippie and # vuln ，  * /",
