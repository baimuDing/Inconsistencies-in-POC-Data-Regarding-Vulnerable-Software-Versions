Box 7.20 - DNS Rebinding Protection Bypass ，  # Date : 2020-06-23 ，  # Exploit Author : RedTeam Pentesting GmbH ，  # Vendor Homepage :  ，  # Version : 7.20 ，  # CVE : 2020-26887 ， Advisory : FRITZ ! Box DNS Rebinding Protection Bypass ， RedTeam Pentesting discovered a vulnerability in FRITZ ! Box router ， devices which allows to resolve DNS answers that point to IP addresses ， in the private local network , despite the DNS rebinding protection ， mechanism. ， Details ， Product : FRITZ ! Box 7490 and potentially others ， Affected Versions : 7.20 and below ， Fixed Versions : >= 7.21 ， Vulnerability Type : Bypass ， Security Risk : low ， Vendor URL :  ， Vendor Status : fixed version released ， Advisory URL :  ， Advisory Status : published ， CVE : 2020-26887 ， CVE URL :  ， Introduction ， \"For security reasons , the FRITZ ! Box suppresses DNS responses that refer ， to IP addresses in its own home network. This is a security function of ， the FRITZ ! Box to protect against what are known as DNS rebinding ， attacks.\" ，  ( from the vendor's homepage )  ， More Details ， FRITZ ! Box router devices employ a protection mechanism against DNS ， rebinding attacks. If a DNS answer points to an IP address in the ， private network range of the router , the answer is suppressed. Suppose ， the FRITZ ! Box routers DHCP server is in its default configuration and ， serves the private IP range of 192.168.178.1/24. If a DNS request is ， made by a connected device , which resolves to an IPv4 address in the ， configured private IP range ( for example 192.168.178.20 ) an empty answer ， is returned. However , if instead the DNS answer contains an AAAA-record ， with the same private IP address in its IPv6 representation ，  (  :  : ffff : 192.168.178.20 ) it is returned successfully. Furthermore , DNS ， requests which resolve to the loopback address 127.0.0.1 or the special ， address 0.0.0.0 can be retrieved , too.",
