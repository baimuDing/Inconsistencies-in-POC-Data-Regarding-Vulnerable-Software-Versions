In this case instead of using the per-process device map directory we can use the fact that the anonymous token can support a per-user device map directory. If this doesnt exist ( which seems to be rare it gets created ) the kernel uses ZwCreateDirectoryObject inside SeGetTokenDeviceMap. ， So instead of creating an anonymous directory object and setting it as the per-process device map we do everything while impersonating the anonymous token and open \\?? as the root directory. We can then use the same trick as in the original",
