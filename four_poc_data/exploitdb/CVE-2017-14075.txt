An attacker must first obtain the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system in order to exploit this vulnerability. ， The specific flaw exists within the processing of IOCTL 0x953824a7 by the windrvr1240 kernel driver. The issue lies in the failure to properly validate user-supplied data which can result in an out-of-bounds write condition. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code under the context of kernel. ， Vulnerability :  ， The vulnerability occurs in sub_405644 at loc_4056CD :  ， .text : 004056CD loc_4056CD :  ; CODE XREF : sub_405644+6A ， .text : 004056CD mov eax ,  [ ebx ]  ， .text : 004056CF xor edx , edx ， .text : 004056D1 mov byte ptr [ edi+eax ]  , 0 ; null byte write ， .text : 004056D5 mov eax , P ， .text : 004056DA add [ eax+880h ]  , edi ; offset HalDispatchTable [ 1 ] +0x880 is null and writable ， Exploitation :  ， At 0x004056da there is a second write , but since HalDispatchTable [ 1 ] +0x880 points to a null dword that is in a writable location , no memory is modified outside of out null byte write ( 0x004056d1 ) . ， Since we can do that , we can keep calling the vuln ioctl code and push down the kernel pointer from HalDispatchTable [ 1 ] to reach userland. We could have just done 2 bytes , but I choose 3 for reliability. ， Finally , the shellcode repairs the HalDispatchTable [ 1 ] pointer by reading HalDispatchTable [ 2 ] and calculating the offset to the HalDispatchTable [ 1 ] pointer and then re-writes the correct pointer back into the HalDispatchTable. ， Timeline :  ， 2017-08-22 Verified and sent to Jungo via sales @ /first @ /security @ /info @ jungo.com ， 2017-08-25 No response from Jungo and two bounced emails ， 2017-08-26 Attempted a follow up with the vendor via website chat ， 2017-08-26 No response via the website chat ， 2017-09-03 Recieved an email from a Jungo representative stating that they are \"looking into it\" ， 2017-09-03 Requested a timeframe for patch development and warned of possible 0day release ， 2017-09-06 No response from Jungo ， 2017-09-06 Public 0day release of advisory ， Example : ",
