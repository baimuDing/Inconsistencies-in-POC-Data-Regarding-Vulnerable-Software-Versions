The problem specifically occurs within a signal handling procedure used invoked when a segmentation violation occurs. The procedure invokes a library function , passing it the name of a predictable filename to create within the systems temporary directory. As a result , an attacker may be capable of launching a symbolic link attack , effectively overwriting the contents of a potentially system critical file with the contents of the created file. ， This could theoretically lead to a denial of service condition , or in some cases privileged elevation. ， / *  ， 0x82-Local.musicqueue_xpl - ， musicqueue.cgi v-1.2.0 local root `",
