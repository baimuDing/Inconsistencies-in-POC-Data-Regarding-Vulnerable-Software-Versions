In the case of a reboot , the firewall will be in-operable for one to five minutes. If the firewall shuts down completely , it will require a power recycle. In the case of a sustained attack , the firewall can be permanently taken off-line. It should be noted that this attack does not appear in the firewall logs except for a reboot notification. ，  #  ! /usr/bin/perl ，  # You can also connect to the Watchguard SOHO through your ，  # browser and press F5 like a maniac on speed to get the ，  # firewall crashing. So , either you run the .pl script or ，  # you fire up your webbrowser... Either way , it works. ，  # ----------------------------------------------------------",
