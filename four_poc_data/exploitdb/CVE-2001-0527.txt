Fields within each record are delimited by pipe ( ' | ' ) and newline characters. ，  # DCForum fails to properly validate this user-supplied account information. As a result , an attacker can cause a corruption of the script's user records by providing a value for the last name field which includes URL-encoded pipes and newlines. By appending desired values to the last name field , an attacker can insert account information for a new user , and specify admin privileges. ，  # This newly-created admin account allows a remote attacker to issue arbitrary commands with the privilege level of the webserver process. ，  #  ! /usr/bin/perl ，  # dcgetadmin.pl - ( C ) 2001 Franklin DeMatto - franklin @ qDefense.com ， use Getopt :  : Std ;  ， use IO :  : Socket ;  ， getopts ( 'ap' )  ;  ， usage (  ) unless (  $  # ARGV == 0 |  |  $  # ARGV == 1 )  ; ",
