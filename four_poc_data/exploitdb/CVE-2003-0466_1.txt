    "text": "ecve : CVE-2003-0466 ， title : WU-FTPD 2.6.2 - 'realpath (  ) ' Off-by-One Buffer Overflow - Unix remote Exploit ， verified : Verified ， exploit_detail : // source :  ， The 'realpath (  ) ' function is a C-library procedure to resolve the canonical , absolute pathname of a file based on a path that may contain values such as '/' , './' , '../' , or symbolic links. A vulnerability that was reported to affect the implementation of 'realpath (  ) ' in WU-FTPD has lead to the discovery that at least one implementation of the C library is also vulnerable. FreeBSD has announced that the off-by-one stack- buffer-overflow vulnerability is present in their libc. Other systems are also likely vulnerable. ， Reportedly , this vulnerability has been successfully exploited against WU-FTPD to execute arbitrary instructions. ， NOTE : Patching the C library alone may not remove all instances of this vulnerability. Statically linked programs may need to be rebuilt with a patched version of the C library. Also , some applications may implement their own version of 'realpath (  ) '. These applications would require their own patches. FreeBSD has published a large list of applications that use 'realpath (  ) '. Administrators of FreeBSD and other systems are urged to review it. For more information , see the advisory 'FreeBSD-SA-03 : 08.realpath'. ， / *  ， wu-ftpd v2.6.2 off-by-one remote 0day exploit. ， Public version - 2003/08/02 ， This vulnerability was discovered by Wojciech Purczynski <cliph @ isec.pl> ,  ， Janusz Niewiadomski <funkysh @ isec.pl>. ， They offered excellent Advisory , I'm thankful to them. ， URL :  ， exploit by \"you dong-hun\" ( Xpl017Elz )  , <szoahc @ hotmail.com>. ， My World :  ，  * / ， / *  ， -=-= POINT !
