    "text": "ecve : CVE-2001-0464 ， title : CrossWind CyberScheduler 2.1 - websyncd Remote Buffer Overflow - CGI remote Exploit ， verified : Verified ， exploit_detail : // source :  ， CrossWind CyberScheduler is a scheduling and calendaring package. It consists of two distinct parts for - a set of cgi scripts on a web server and a set of daemons ( or services ) on a database server. Both parts are available for Windows NT , Linux and a range of UNIX platforms including Solaris. ， One of the CyberScheduler daemons 'websyncd' ( websyncd.exe on Windows NT ) contains an exploitable buffer overflow in its timezone string parser. A timezone string is passed to websyncd by the websync.cgi cgi program ( websync.exe on NT ) through the tzs form variable. ， Because websyncd runs as root , a stack overflow allows arbitrary code execution as root. The overflow occurs before any logon credentials are verified by websync.cgi , so unprivileged remote users can exploit this vulnerability. ， / * PRIVATE -- DO NOT DISTRIBUTE !  !  ， x-cybershed.c ， TimeZONE buffer overflow on cgi script rendering complete control of ， the stack. ， Enrique A.
