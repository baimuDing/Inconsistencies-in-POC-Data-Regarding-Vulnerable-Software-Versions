An attacker may exploit this condition to overwrite the return address with a pointer to embedded attacker-supplied instructions. ， To exploit this issue the attacker must transmit the maliciously constructed skinfile to a victim of the attack. This may be done via a webpage or HTML e-mail. Exploitation of this issue may result in execution of attacker-supplied instructions with the privileges of the user opening the malicious skinfile. ， / * =========================================================== ， RealJukebox2 1.0.2.379 Exploit ， The Shadow Penguin Security (  ， Written by UNYUN ( unyun @ shadowpenguin.org )  ，  * /",
