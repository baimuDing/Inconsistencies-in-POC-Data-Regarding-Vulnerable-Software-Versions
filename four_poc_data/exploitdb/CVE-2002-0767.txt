The file descriptor is used to access /dev/initctl and this descriptor is normally used by 'initctl' , 'need' and 'provide' programs to pass instructions to simpleinit. The simpleinit process runs with root privileges. ， A local user whose process inherits this file descriptor will be able to cause simpleinit to execute commands as the superuser.",
