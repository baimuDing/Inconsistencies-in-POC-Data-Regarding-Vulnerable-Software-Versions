By spoofing IRDP Router Advertisements , an attacker can remotely add default route entries on a remote system. The default route entry added by the attacker will be preferred over the default route obtained from the DHCP server. This results in higher susceptibility to denial of service , passive snooping and man in the middle attacks. While Windows 2000 does indeed have IRDP enabled by default , it is less vulnerable as it is impossible to give it a route that is preferred over the default route obtained via DHCP. ， SunOS systems will also intentionally use IRDP under specific conditions. For Solaris2.6 , the IRDP daemon , in.rdisc , will be started if the following conditions are met :  ， The system is a host , not a router. ， The system did not learn a default gateway from a DHCP server. ， The system does not have any static routes. ， The system does not have a valid /etc/defaultrouter file. ， L0pht ( LHI ) has made available",
