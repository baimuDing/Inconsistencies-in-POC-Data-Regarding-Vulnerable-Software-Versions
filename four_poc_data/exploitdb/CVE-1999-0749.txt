    "text": "ecve : CVE-1999-0749 ， title : Microsoft Windows 95/98 Internet Explorer 5/Telnet - Local Heap Overflow - Windows local Exploit ， verified : Verified ， exploit_detail : // source :  ， Windows 95 and 98 systems running IE4 or specific versions of IE5 ( 5.00.2314.1003 and 5.00.2314.1003IC ) are susceptible to a remote vulnerability that allows the execution of arbitrary code on a target that views a malicious web page. This vulnerability is due to a combination of two different weaknesses :  ， First , the Windows 95 and 98 telnet.exe is vulnerable to a buffer overflow condition. While preparing the Connect Failed message box , there is an unchecked input buffer of 255 characters , and sending more than that will overwrite the heap. ， Second , IE5 will start an instance of telnet.exe if passed any of the following URL types : rlogin :  , telnet : or tn3270 : . Earlier versions of IE5 allowed only two parameters to be passed in these URLs , but the most recent ones , listed above , will allow any number of parameters to be passed , up to a total of approximately 460 bytes. This is enough for an attacker to create a URL that will start an instance of telnet on the client machine , and pass it the overrun code he or she wants executed. ， The exploit runs when the telnet window is closed.",
