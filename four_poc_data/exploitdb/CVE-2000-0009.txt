    "text": "ecve : CVE-2000-0009 ， title : Nortel Networks Optivity NETarchitect 2.0 - PATH - Multiple local Exploit ， verified : Verified ， exploit_detail : source :  ， NETarchitect is an application for simplifying the task of designing and deploying complex switched network system configurations , produced by Nortel Networks and usually shipped with the Optivity Network Configuration System suite of utilities. It is possible to gain root privileges on an HP-UX ( possibly Solaris ) system running NETarchitect by exploiting a path vulnerability in the binary /opt/bna/bin/bna_pass. bna_pass executes 'rm' assuming that the end user's PATH value is valid and the real rm binary is in the one being called.Because of this , it is possible to have bna_pass execute arbitrary binaries as root if the PATH variable is manipulated. A malicious user can add \".\" to his PATH environment variable and have binaries searched for and executed in . before any others [ directories in PATH ] . A false 'rm' would then be executed , compromising the system. ，  #  ! /bin/sh ，  # bna.sh - Loneguard 03/03/99 ，  # Poision path xploit for Optivity NETarchitect on HPUX ， cd /tmp ， touch /usr/bna/tmp/.loginChk ， PATH=. :  $ PATH ; export PATH",
