Weber ( Office Vienna )  ， SEC Consult Vulnerability Lab ， An integrated part of SEC Consult ， Bangkok - Berlin - Linz - Luxembourg - Montreal - Moscow ， Kuala Lumpur - Singapore - Vienna ( HQ ) - Vilnius - Zurich ， Vendor description :  ， \"Solare Datensysteme GmbH ( SDS ) is headquartered in the southern German city ， of Binsdorf and specialises in the development and sale of monitoring systems ， Jrg Karwath and was created from the company \"TOP Solare Datensysteme\". This ， company had been developing and selling the \"SolarLog\" product range since ， 2005. Our core competence covers innovative products with short development ， cycles and an excellent cost/performance ratio. Our developments have the ， outstanding characteristics of high customer value , simple operation and ， universal application without requiring time-consuming installation of ， software.\" ， Source :  ， Business recommendation :  ， SEC Consult recommends to immediately install the available firmware update ， and restrict network access. ， Furthermore , this device should not be used in production until a thorough ， security review has been performed by security professionals and all ， identified issues have been resolved. ， Vulnerability overview/description :  ， 1 ) Unauthenticated Download of Configuration including Device-Password ， This vulnerability is present at least on firmware 2.8.4-56. ， An attacker can download the configuration file without authentication and ， extract the password to login to Solar-Log. Therefore , an attacker can gain ， administrative access to such a device without prior authentication. ， 2 ) Cross-Site Request Forgery ( CSRF )  ， This vulnerability is present at least on firmware 3.5.2-85. ， A CSRF vulnerability enables an attacker to remove/modify a password of a ， device by luring an authenticated user to click on a crafted link. An attacker ， is able to take over the device by exploiting this vulnerability. ， 3 ) Unauthenticated Arbitrary File Upload ， This vulnerability is present at least on firmware 3.5.2-85. ， Any files can be uploaded on the Solar-Log by using a crafted POST request. An ， attacker can start a malicious website or use the Solar-Log as share to store ， any ( illegal ) contents. ， 4 ) Information Disclosure ( CVE-2001-1341 )  ， All Solar-Log devices in the current firmware versions are prone to this ， information disclosure vulnerability. ( 2.8.4-56 / 3.5.2-85 )  ， The network configuration of the internal network including the gateway and ， the MAC address of the device are leaked. ， All details of the IPC @ CHIP from Beck IPC ( like RTOS ， version and serial number are leaked as well. ， 5 ) Unauthenticated Change of Network-Configuration ， All Solar-Log devices in the current firmware versions are prone to this ， vulnerability. ( 2.8.4-56 / 3.5.2-85 )  ， Since the Solar-Log is based on the chips of Beck IPC a UDP configuration ， server is enabled by default. This server allows to change the IP configuration ， over a specific UDP port. This functionality can be protected with a password ,  ， but this is not set in the affected firmware versions. ， The MAC address , which is leaked by 4 )  , is needed to configure the device. ， An attacker can reconfigure the device without any authentication. ， 6 ) Unauthenticated Denial of Service ， All Solar-Log devices in the current firmware versions are prone to this ， vulnerability. ( 2.8.4-56 / 3.5.2-85 )  ， The Beck IPC UDP configuration server on Solar-Log device can be attacked with ， arbitrary UDP packets to permanently disable the Solar-Log until a manual ， reboot is triggered. ， 7 ) Potential Unauthenticated Reprogram of IPC @ CHIP Flash Memory ， Potentially available in all Solar-Log devices in the current firmware ， versions. ( 2.8.4-56 / 3.5.2-85 )  ， Since the \"CHIPTOOL\" from BECK IPC enables a developer to reprogram the chip ， over the network via UDP , a missing password can also enable an attacker to do ， this on a Solar-Log device. This action can lead to a simple Denial of Service ， or a complex botnet of Solar-Log devices !  ， Proof of concept :  ， 1 ) Unauthenticated Download of Configuration including Device-Password ， The full configuration is exposed by sending the following GET-request :  ， GET /data/misc.dat HTTP/1.1 ， Host : <IP-Address> ，  [ ... ]  ， Since the response contains the password , an attacker can easily take ， control over the device. ， 2 ) Cross-Site Request Forgery ， By luring the user to issue the following request , the password is removed :  ， POST /setjp HTTP/1.1 ， Host : <IP-Address> ， preval=none ; postval=105 ; {\"221\" : \"0\" , \"223\" : \"0\" , \"225\" : \"1\" , \"287\" : \"\" , \"288\" : {\"0\" : \"0\" , \"1\" : \"0\"} , \"440\" : \"0\"} ， By luring the user to issue the following request , the password is modified :  ， POST /setjp HTTP/1.1 ， Host : <IP-Address> ， preval=none ; postval=105 ; {\"221\" : \"0\" , \"223\" : \"1\" , \"224\" : \"<New-Password>\" , \"225\" : \"1\" , \"287\" : \"\" , \"288\" : {\"0\" : \"0\" , \"1\" : \"0\"} , \"440\" : \"0\"} ， 3 ) Unauthenticated Arbitrary File Upload ， Any files can be uploaded by using the following POST-request :  ， POST /menu/d_debug_db.html HTTP/1.1 ， Host : <IP-Address> ，  [ ... ]  ， Referer :  ， Content-Type : multipart/form-data ; boundary=-301473270 ， Content-Length : 341 ， -301473270 ， Content-Disposition : form-data ; name=\"DESTINATION-PATH\" ， PoC.html ， -301473270 ， Content-Disposition : form-data ; name=\"FILE-CONTENT\" ; filename=\"file.txt\" ， Content-Type : text/plain",
