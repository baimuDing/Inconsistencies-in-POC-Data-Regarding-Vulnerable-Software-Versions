The vulnerability exists in the list command. By supplying a long , well-crafted string as the second argument to the list command , it becomes possible to execute code on the machine. ， Executing the list command requires an account on the machine. In addition , privileges have been dropped in imapd prior to the location of the buffer overrun. As such , this vulnerability would only be useful in a scenario where a user has an account , but no shell level access. This would allow them to gain shell access. ， Overflows have also been found in the COPY , LSUB , RENAME and FIND command. All of these , like the LIST command , require a login on the machine. ，  # This file is part of the Metasploit Framework and may be redistributed ，  # according to the licenses defined in the Authors field below.
