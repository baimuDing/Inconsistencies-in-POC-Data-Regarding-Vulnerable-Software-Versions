During the pre-authentication phase Webshell fails to perform sufficient bounds checking on user-supplied HTTP parameters. As a result , a malicious attacker may be able to trigger a buffer overrun. ， Successful exploitation of this issue would allow an attacker to overwrite the vulnerable function's instruction pointer. By causing the program to return to attacker-supplied instructions , it may be possible to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the target process. ， It should be noted that this issue was discovered in H-Sphere 2.3 RC3. It is not yet known whether earlier versions are also vulnerable. ，  * / ， / *  ，  * Remote r00t exploit for Webshell 2.4 ( possibly other versions ) . ，  * Vulnerability found and exploit written by Carl Livitt ，  *  ( carl (  @  ) learningshophull.co.uk ) . ， Exploits a simple stack-based buffer overflow in CGI.C of the ， HSphere webshell component which is installed SUID & GUID root ， by default. ， This exploit will bind a r00t shell to port 10000 ( by default ) of ， the remote box. Feel free to use any shellcode of your choice. ， This code is a butchered version of the local exploit for ， webshell. It works on my test box , and won't be refined any further ,  ， although the bruteforcer should work on most webshell installations. ， To",
