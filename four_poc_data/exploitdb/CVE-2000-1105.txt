Query results will display the full physical path of the file and will only be retrieved from directories that have been explicitly configured as searchable directories within the Indexing Service. ， Successful disclosure of a file's availability may aid in more severe attacks against the target system. ， --> ， <HTML> ， <HEAD> ， <TITLE> ， Demo - IE 5.x Win2000 Indexing service vulnerability ， </TITLE> ， </HEAD> ， <BODY> ， Demo - IE 5.x Win2000 Indexing service vulnerability ， <BR> ， <p>Legal Notice :  ， <br>This Advisory and Demonstration is Copyright ( c ) 2000 Georgi Guninski.
