NodeManager Professional V2.00 has a stack overflow ， // vulnerability that can be exploited by sending a specially crafted ， // SNMPv1 trap. ， // NodeManager Professional allows the user to use a format string to ， // customize how each received trap is logged. For example , the default ， // format string for the LinkDown event is ， // \"Snmp Trap LinkDown ( EnterPrise=%EPRISE ObjectID=%OID Value=%DATA ) \" ， // When a LinkDown-Trap packet is received , the various placeholders ， // ( e.g. %OID , %DATA ) will be replaced with the received values. The ， // resulting string is then displayed on screen and written out to a log file. ， // The various fields from the received LinkDown-Trap UDP packet is first copied ， // to global buffers in the .data segment. When the format string is parsed ,  ， // each received value is first copied to a 512-byte local stack buffer before ， // it is concatenated to the final string. ， // By sending more than 512 bytes in the Trap DATA field , it is possible ， // to overflow the stack buffer and overwrite the EIP. ， // This exploit code binds shell on port 2001 of a system running a vulnerable ， // version of NodeManager Professional. ， // Advisory ， // Greetz : snooq , sk , and all guys at SIG^2 G-TEC ， // ( ",
