This ， vulnerability can be exploited by a malicious user to disclose potentially sensitive ， information. The flaw is caused due to a lack of input filtering in the SugarCRM RSS ， module , which can be exploited to disclose the content of local files. ， The RSS module allows SugarCRM users to add RSS feeds to their personal RSS list. The application expects an ， URL value pointing to a valid RSS feed. However , the URL variable value is not properly sanitised and any URI ， value can be entered instead. In this particular case , it was discovered that it is possible to enter a file path to ， any files on the local system hosting the SugarCRM application. ， As a result SugarCRM does not display the new RSS feed in the list as it is not a valid RSS URL Feed. However ,  ， the application creates a local file with the filename of the md5 hash of the URL entered. The file is created in ， the directory cache/feeds . If the Apache web server is used , the file is created with the user www-data ， containing read permission. ， Exploitation ， An exploitation example in a LAMP ( Linux , Apache , Mysql , PHP ) environment :  ， If an authenticated attacker enters a value of /etc/passwd ( without quotes ) in the RSS URL field , the ， application will generate a MD5 hash of the string containing the file path. In this case , the value /etc/passwd ， is hashed to c5068b7c2b1707f8939b283a2758a691 ( without quotes ) . The MD5 hash is then used as a ， filename with the file contents of /etc/passwd. The file /etc/passwd can then be viewable publicly at ， Exploitation of this flaw does not require authentication. ， The URL variable is handled by the /modules/Feeds/Feed.php page. The array variable $ url is passed without ， filtering to the xml_domit_rss_document function at the following line :  ，  $ rssdoc = new xml_domit_rss_document (  $ this->url , cache/feeds/ , 3600 )  ;  ， The XML domit RSS plugin is then called and retrieves the file content at the path given and then generate the ， MD5 hashed file in the cache/feeds folder as instructed by the function in Feed.php . ， Solution ， Install the vendor supplied patches. ， Patch 4.5.1j :  ， Patch 5.0.0c :  ， About Security-Assessment.com ， Security-Assessment.com is Australasias leading team of Information Security consultants specialising in ， providing high quality Information Security services to clients throughout the Asia Pacific region.
