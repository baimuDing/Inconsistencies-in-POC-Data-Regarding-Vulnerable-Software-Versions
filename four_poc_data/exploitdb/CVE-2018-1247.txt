With RSA's award-winning products , organizations effectively detect ,  ， investigate , and respond to advanced attacks ; confirm and manage identities ;  ， and ultimately , reduce IP theft , fraud , and cybercrime.\" ， Source :  ， Business recommendation :  ， By exploiting the vulnerabilities documented in this advisory an attacker can ， obtain sensitive information from the RSA Authentication Manager file system ,  ， initiate arbitrary TCP connections or cause DoS. In addition to this , clients ， of the RSA Authentication manager can be affected by exploiting client-side ， issues. ， SEC Consult recommends to apply the available patches from the vendor. ， Vulnerability overview/description :  ， 1 ) XML External Entity Injection ( XXE )  ( CVE-2018-1247 )  ， The used XML parser is resolving XML external entities which allows an ， authenticated attacker ( or an attacker that is able to trick an authenticated ， user into importing malicious XML files ) to read files , send requests to ， systems on the internal network ( e.g port scanning ) or cause a DoS ( e.g. ， billion laughs attack ) . ， This issue has been fixed by RSA as described in the advisory DSA-2018-086. ， 2 ) Cross-site Flashing ， The vulnerable flash file does not filter or escape the user input ， sufficiently. This leads to a reflected cross-site scripting vulnerability. ， With reflected cross-site scripting , an attacker can inject arbitrary HTML or ， JavaScript code into the victim's web browser. Once the victim clicks a ， malicious link the attacker's code is executed in the context of the victim's ， web browser. ， The vulnerability exists in a third party component called pmfso. ， This issue has been fixed by RSA as described in the advisory DSA-2018-082. ， 3 ) DOM based Cross-site Scripting ， Several client-side scripts handle user supplied data with insufficient ， validation before storing it in the DOM. This issue can be exploited to cause ， reflected cross-site scripting. ， The identified issues exist in third party components. One of the affected ， components is PopCalendarX which has an assigned CVE ( CVE-2017-9072 ) . ， This issue has been fixed by RSA as described in the advisory DSA-2018-082. ， Two further issues affecting other third party components are not yet fixed ,  ， as the third party vendor did not supply a patch to RSA yet. ， Proof of concept :  ， 1 ) XML External Entity Injection ( XXE )  ( CVE-2018-1247 )  ， The Security Console of the RSA Authentication Manager allows authenticated ， users to",
