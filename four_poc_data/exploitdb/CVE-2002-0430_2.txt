    "text": "ecve : CVE-2002-0430 ， title : Cobalt RaQ 2.0/3.0/4.0 XTR - 'MultiFileUpload.php' Authentication Bypass ( 2 ) - PHP remote Exploit ， verified : Verified ， exploit_detail : source :  ， Cobalt RaQ is a server appliance for Internet-based services. It is distributed and maintained by Sun Microsystems. ， The 'MultiFileUpload.php' script is not sufficiently protected from outside access. While other sensitive administrative scripts are protected with HTTP authentication , 'MultiFileUpload.php' is not. Remote clients may invoke the execution of this script without valid administrator credentials. ， In doing so , it is possible for an attacker to upload files that are created on the server filesystem as any user. ， Furthermore , the uploaded files are stored in '/tmp' with predictable filenames. If the attacker has local access to the system , this vulnerability can be exploited to overwrite a file of equal user and group ownership through the use of a symbolic link. ， Successful exploitation of this vulnerability by an attacker with local access may result in a compromise of root privileges. Attackers without local access may be able to cause a denial of service through consumption of disk space. ，  #  ! /bin/sh ，  # Script for creating symlinks from output of local-timerace-xtr ， do ， ln -s /etc/passwd $ foo ， done",
