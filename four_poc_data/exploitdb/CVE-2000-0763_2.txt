This may make it possible to execute arbitrary code with root privileges. ， While several vulnerable operating systems have been listed , this list is by no means complete. ， It has been reported that this vulnerability exists only in systems with versions of xlock that use the error (  ) call. ( it is also unverified whether the bug is in libc or xlib ) . ， / *  ， Exploit for xlock -d format string bug on i386 Linux. ， By Ben Williams 21 Oct 2000. ， Works on Slackware 7.1 , Redhat 6.2 - did not have setuid though , Mandrake 7.0. ， Redhat 6.1 won't work because f",
