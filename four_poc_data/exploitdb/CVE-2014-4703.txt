VULNERABILITY ， check_dhcp - Nagios Plugins = 2.0.2 Race Condition ， II. BACKGROUND ， \"Nagios is an open source computer system monitoring , network monitoring and ， infrastructure monitoring software application. Nagios offers monitoring and ， alerting services for servers , switches , applications , and services. ， It alerts the users when things go wrong and alerts them a second time when ， the problem has been resolved. ， Nagios Plugins ( Official )  ， The Nagios Plugins Development Team maintains a bundle of more than fifty ， standard plugins for Nagios and other monitoring applications that use the ， straightforward plugin interface originally invented by the Nagios folks. ， Each plugin is a stand-alone command line tool that provides a specific type ， of check. Typically , your monitoring software runs these plugins to determine ， the current status of hosts and services on your network. ， Some of the provided plugins let you check local system metrics ( such as load ， averages , processes , or disk space usage )  , others use various network protocols ，  ( such as ICMP , SNMP , or HTTP ) to perform remote checks. ， This allows for checking a large number of common host and service types. ，  * check_dhcp plugin ， This plugin tests the availability of DHCP servers on a network.\" ， III. INTRODUCTION ， check_dhcp plugin ( part of the official Nagios Plugins package ) contained ， a vulnerability that allowed a malicious attacker to read parts of INI ， config files belonging to root on a local system. It allowed an attacker ， to obtain sensitive information like passwords that should only be accessible ， by root user. ， This vulnerability was discussed in my previous advisory available at :  ， The vulnerability was quickly patched by vendor in the release of nagios plugins ， version 2.0.2 however the security measures in the patch are not sufficient and ， the code is vulnerable to Race Condition attack. ， Race Condition makes it possible for an arbitrary user to read parts of a ， root-owned file despite the checks. ， IV. DESCRIPTION ， Nagios Plugins 2.0.2 introduces the following checks before the SUID root check_dhcp ， program accesses a file provided by a user :  ， ----- [ lib/parse_ini.c ] ----- ， / * We must be able to stat (  ) the thing. * / ， die ( STATE_UNKNOWN , \"%s %s\\n\" , _ ( \"Can't read config file.\" )  , strerror ( errno )  )  ;  ， / * The requested file must be a regular file. * / ， die ( STATE_UNKNOWN , \"%s\\n\" , _ ( \"Can't read config file. Requested path is not a regular file.\" )  )  ;  ， / * We must be able to read the requested file. * / ， die ( STATE_UNKNOWN , \"%s %s\\n\" , _ ( \"Can't read config file.\" )  , strerror ( errno )  )  ;  ， / * We need to successfully open the file for reading... * / ， die ( STATE_UNKNOWN , \"%s %s\\n\" , _ ( \"Can't read config file.\" )  , strerror ( errno )  )  ;  ， A configfile will only be opened if it is a regular file ( not a symlink ) and only if it ， is readable by the real user running the program ( checked with access (  ) call ) . ， These checks prevent a user from accessing a file that is not owned by them e.g :  ，  $ /usr/local/nagios/libexec/check_dhcp -v -extra-opts=mysql @ /root/.my.cnf ， Can't read config file. Permission denied ， However there's a possibility of a Race Condition here. If an attacker manages ， to create a symlink leading to /root/.my.cnf in the very short time window that ， occurs between the regular file/permission checks and the fopen (  ) call then the ， attacker could still be successful in obtaining the contents of the file. ， V. PROOF OF CONCEPT ， Below is an example exploit that demonstrates this attack. ， ------- [ checkdhcp_race_exploit.c ] ------- ， / * check_dhcp 2.0.2 Arbitrary Option File Read - Race Condition Exploit * / ， / * Created by Dawid Golunski ( dawid @ legalhackers.com )  * / ， / *  * /",
