    "text": "ecve : CVE-2001-0630 ， title : mimanet source viewer 2.0 - Directory Traversal - CGI remote Exploit ， verified : Verified ， exploit_detail : source :  ， MIMAnet Source Viewer is a freely available CGI script which allows users to view the source code of files located elsewhere on the server. ， Source Viewer accepts an argument , 'loc' , which it uses as the filename when opening the requested file. Unfortunately it does not filter '..' and '/' characters , which can be misinterpreted by the script and cause files outside of the intended directory to be opened. As a result , it may be possible for attackers to view the contents of arbitrary webserver-readable files on the filesystem. ， The following URL demonstrates the problem :  ， loc=../ [ any file outside restricted directory ] ",
