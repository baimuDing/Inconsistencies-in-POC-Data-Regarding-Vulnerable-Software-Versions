A successful CSRF attack can compromise end user data and may allow an attacker to perform an account hijack. If the targeted end user is the administrator account , this results in a full compromise of Watch4net. ， Affected versions ， Versions of EMC ViPR SRM prior to version 3.7 are affected by these vulnerabilities. ， See also ， - ESA-2016-039 ， - CVE-2016-0891 ， Fix ， EMC released 34247_ViPR-SRM to fix these vulnerabilities. Please note that this fix is only available for registered EMC Online Support customers. ， Introduction ， EMC M&R ( formerly known as Watch4net ) enables cross-domain performance monitoring of infrastructure and data center components in real-time - from a single , customizable dashboard. EMC M&R is a core embedded software technology existing in EMC ViPR , ViPR SRM and Service Assurance Suite. ， EMC M&R ( Watch4net ) does not protect against Cross-Site Request Forgery ( CSRF ) attacks. A successful CSRF attack can compromise end user data and may allow an attacker to perform an account hijack. If the targeted end user is the administrator account , this results in a full compromise of Watch4net. ， Details ， Cross-Site Request Forgery ( CSRF ) is an attack , which forces an end user to execute unwanted actions on a web application to which the targeted user is currently authenticated. With a little help of social engineering an attacker may trick the users of a web application into executing actions ( requests ) of the attacker's choosing. ， The following proof of concept will create a new user named CSRF with password set to 1 in Watch4net - provided that the victim is logged in with an administrator account. ， -->",
