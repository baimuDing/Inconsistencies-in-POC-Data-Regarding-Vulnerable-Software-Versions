It brings application intelligence into the ， network and enables efficient deployment of secure , reliable , and accelerated ， Web service environments based on XML ( Extensible Markup Language ) and SOAP ，  ( Simple Object Access Protocol ) using a shared network infrastructure. ， The ACE XML Gateway helps you to secure , manage , monitor , and accelerate an SOA. ， In a service-oriented environment , the ACE XML Gateway acts as a service ， virtualization layer. It decouples service providers from consumers , increasing ， the stability , maintainability , and flexibility of those services. It enforces ， security policies and applies business rules , such as routing decisions and ， content validation processing , across message traffic in the environment. ， The ACE XML Gateway secures your SOA implementation by providing advanced XML ， firewall capabilities , with built-in protection against XML-based attacks ,  ， such as SQL injection or entity expansion attacks , content screening capabilities ， and more. ， With a high-performance , streaming XML processing engine , the ACE XML Gateway ， reduces the performance impact of XML traffic on the network. ， Vulnerability Explaination ， Let's wait for the Cisco response , so , we'll have a better understanding on this ， issue. Meanwhile... ， I think this is a design error because ACE XML doesn't have in mind that the ， client could probably be in the same network segment internally , so , it receives ， the request , which cannot be processed , and throws an error message disclosing ， an internal IP address. ， According to the ACE XML Gateway User Guide , Log Messages chapter , the listed ， error messages belong to different categories such as Alerts , Startup , Operational ， and Policy Errors , so , I'm assuming that the OPTIONS HTTP method doesn't fit in ， none of the mentioned categories , resulting in a message explaining that there's ， no handler for this type of request which discloses an internal IP address. ， Cisco PSIRT ( Product Security Incident Response Team ) responded by saying that the ， bug is triggered not only by the OPTIONS request. Internal IP address is included ， in response if ACE XML Gateway was not able to find a matching handler for the ， request. Also , the PSIRT verified that GET request , with a path for which no ， handler was configured , results in the same address disclosure. ， Again , I think it's a design error because it wasn't taken into account that the ， error message would disclose an internal IP address from the internal network.",
