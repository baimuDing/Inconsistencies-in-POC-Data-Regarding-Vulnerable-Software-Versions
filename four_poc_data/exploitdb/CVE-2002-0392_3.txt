    "text": "ecve : CVE-2002-0392 ， title : Apache 1.x/2.0.x - Chunked-Encoding Memory Corruption ( 2 ) - Multiple remote Exploit ， verified : Verified ， exploit_detail : // source :  ， When processing requests coded with the 'Chunked Encoding' mechanism , Apache fails to properly calculate required buffer sizes. This is believed to be due to improper ( signed ) interpretation of an unsigned integer value. Consequently , several conditions that have security implications may occur. Reportedly , a buffer overrun and signal race condition occur. Exploiting these conditions may allow arbitrary code to run. ， Update : Reportedly , at least one worm is exploiting this vulnerability to propagate in the wild. The worm targets FreeBSD 4.5 systems running Apache 1.3.22-24 and 1.3.20. Other versions may also be affected. ， / *  ，  * apache-nosejob.c - Now with FreeBSD & NetBSD targets ; > ，  *  !  !
