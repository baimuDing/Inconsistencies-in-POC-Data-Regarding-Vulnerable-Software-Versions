    "text": "ecve : CVE-2017-15918 ， title : Sera 1.2 - Local Privilege Escalation / Password Disclosure - macOS local Exploit ， verified : Not Verified ， exploit_detail :  # Sera is a free app for mac and iOS that lets you unlock your mac automatically ，  # when your iphone is within a configured proximity. ，  # Unfortunately to facilitate this it stores the users login password in their ，  # home directory at :  ，  #  ~ /Library/Preferences/no.ignitum.SeraOSX.plist ，  # This makes root privilege escalation trivial and worse than that even ，  # facilitates dumping the keychain as we can easily obtain the user's login ，  # password. If they are an admin user we can even dump items from the system ，  # keychain. ，  # The author of Sera has said he will shut the project down and make the code ，  # publicly available so no fix is likely to be forthcoming anytime soon. ，  # It is strongly recommended not to use this app and if you have done so in the ，  # past make sure you remove this file that contains your login password. ，  # dbf4f7b64cac8a60a2c7b3ba2a3988b84a148a3f6e31bcb58d4554e5e74d8edf ，  # ------------------------------------------------------------------------- ，  #  !
