    "text": "ecve : CVE-2001-0109 ， title : SuSE 6.x/7.0 - MkDir Error Handling rctab Race Condition ( 1 ) - Linux local Exploit ， verified : Verified ， exploit_detail : source :  ， rctab is the Run Control Tab script included with the SuSE distribution of the Linux Operating System. SuSE is a freely available , Open Source Operating system maintained by SuSE Incorporated. ， A race condition in the rctab script could allow an attacker to either gain elevated privileges , or append to and corrupt system files. This problem exists due to the insecure creation of files in the /tmp directory by the rctab script. Upon execution of the rctab script , rctab creates a subdirectory in the /tmp directory , using directory name rctmpdir. [ pid of rctab process ] . The script , which is normally run by root , does not check for an already existing rctmpdir. [ pid of rctab process ] directory. Additionally , the use of the -p flag with mkdir does not generate an error when the directory already exists , allowing the script to continue executing. ， This problem makes it possible for a malicious user to guess the future process id of the rctab process , and create a range of directories that either will overwrite system files , or append to other system files and potentially allow elevation of privileges. ，  #  !
