    "text": "ecve : CVE-1999-0874 ， title : Microsoft IIS 4.0 - Remote Buffer Overflow ( 4 ) - Windows remote Exploit ， verified : Verified ， exploit_detail : // source :  ， Microsoft IIS reported prone to a buffer overflow vulnerability in the way IIS handles requests for several file types that require server side processing. This vulnerability may allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the target machine. ， IIS supports a number of file extensions that require futher processing. When a request is made for one of these types of files a specific DLL processes it. A stack buffer overflow vulnerability exists in several of these DLL's while handling .HTR , .STM or .IDC extensions. ， // IIS Injector for NT ， // written by Greg Hoglund <hoglund @ ieway.com> ， // If you would like to deliver a payload , it must be stored in a binary file. ， // This injector decouples the payload from the injection code allowing you to ， // create a numnber of different attack payloads. This code could be used , for ， // example , by a military that needs to attack IIS servers , and has characterized ， // the eligible hosts. The proper attack can be chosen depending on needs. Since ， // the payload is so large with this injection vector , many options are available. ， // First and foremost , virii can delivered with ease. The payload is also plenty ， // large enough to remotely download and install a back door program. ， // Considering the monoculture of NT IIS servers out on the 'Net , this represents a ， // very serious security problem.",
