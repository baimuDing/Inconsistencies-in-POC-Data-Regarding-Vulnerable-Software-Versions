Nabaztag is a Wi-Fi enabled ， ambient electronic device in the shape of a rabbit , invented by Rafi ， Haladjian and Olivier Mvel , and manufactured by the company Violet. [ 1 ]  ， Nabaztag was designed to be a \"smart object\" comparable to those ， manufactured by Ambient Devices ; it can connect to the Internet ( to ， download weather forecasts , read its owner's email , etc. ) . It is also ， customizable and programmable to an extent. ， Finding 1 : Python Module Hijacking ， Credit : Daniel Crowley of Trustwave SpiderLabs ， CVE : CVE-2013-4867 ， CWE : CWE-427 ， During the setup process for a Karotz unit , if wifi is selected as the ， method used to connect to the Internet , a python script named \"autorunwifi\" ， is run as root to set up the wifi connectivity. This file , along with ， several others , is placed in the root of a USB flash drive or hard drive. ， Another file , named \"autorunwifi.sig\" , contains a signature of autorunwifi ， signed with the private key for Violet , to prevent modifications to the ， \"autorunwifi\" script. ， Since Python first attempts to load modules not built into Python from the ， same directory as the invoked script , it is possible to override the ， functionality of imported modules by placing a file with the same basename ， as the module being imported and an extension of \".py\". In this case , it is ， possible to write a Python script named \"simplejson.py\" and place it in the ， same directory as the other setup files , which will cause the contents of ， simplejson.py to be executed at the beginning of the \"autorunwifi\" script ， execution. ， This attack requires a USB flash drive to be plugged into the Karotz unit ,  ， and requires the Karotz to be turned off and on. ， The following is a proof of concept \"simplejson.py\" file that will copy the ， pubring.gpg file from the Karotz onto the inserted USB key , which is ， processed with MD5 to produce the key used to decrypt the root filesystem ， simplejson.py",
