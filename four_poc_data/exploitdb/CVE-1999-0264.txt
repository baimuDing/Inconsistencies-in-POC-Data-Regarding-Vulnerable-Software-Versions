( Note that htmlscript is an older product no longer distributed by Miva under that name. ) Versions of the htmlscript interpreter ( a CGI script ) prior to 2.9932 are vulnerable to a file reading directory traversal attack using relative paths ( eg. , \"../../../../../../etc/passwd\" ) . An attacker need only append this path as a variable passed to the script via a URL. The contents of any file to which the web server process has read access can be retrieved using this method.",
