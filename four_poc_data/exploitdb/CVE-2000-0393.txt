This makes it possible to obtain a sgid 'disk' shell. Using these privileges along with code provided in the exploit , it is possible to change attributes on raw disks. This in turns allows an attacker to create a root shell , thus compromising the intergrity of the machine. ， Red Hat , Linux Mandrake , and Turbo Linux do not currently ship with kscd setgid 'disk'.",
