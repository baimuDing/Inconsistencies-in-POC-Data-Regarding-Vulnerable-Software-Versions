It is not setuid root by itself , but can inherit root privileges if called by midikeys ( which is setuid on some old IRIX systems ) . Soundplayer is vulnerable to an input validation problem. When saving a file to disk with soundplayer , if a semicolon is appended to the end of the \"proper\" or \"real\" filename input followed by a command to be executed ( no spaces )  , the command will run with the privileges soundplayer has ( elevated or not ) . It is possible to compromise root access locally through exploitation of this vulnerability if soundplayer is executed ( then exploited.. ) through setuid midikeys. ，  #  ! /bin/sh ，  # Irix 6.x soundplayer xploit - Loneguard 20/02/99 ，  # Good example of how bad coding in a non-setuid/priviledged process ，  # can offer up rewt",
