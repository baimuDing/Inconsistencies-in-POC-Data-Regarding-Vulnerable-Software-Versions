If an attacker manages to obtain a copy of the encrypted credentials , it is trivial to decrypt them. ， Affected products ， EMC reports that the following products are affected by this vulnerability :  ， - EMC M&R ( Watch4Net ) versions prior 6.5u1 ， - EMC ViPR SRM versions prior to 3.6.1 ， See also ， - CVE-2015-0514 ， - ESA-2015-004 : EMC M&R ( Watch4Net ) Multiple Vulnerabilities ， - ESA-2015-004 : EMC M&R ( Watch4Net ) Multiple Vulnerabilities ( login required )  ， Fix ， EMC released the following updated versions that resolve this vulnerability :  ， - EMC M&R ( Watch4Net ) 6.5u1 ， - EMC ViPR SRM 3.6.1 ， Registered customers can download upgraded software from support.emc.com at ， Introduction ， EMC M&R ( formerly known as Watch4net ) enables cross-domain performance monitoring of infrastructure and data center components in real-time - from a single , customizable dashboard. ， The Remote-Shell-Collector module from EMC M&R ( Watch4net ) can push and run executable files on remote hosts to collect performance data from storage environments. Remote-Shell-Collector uses SSH for this purpose. ， In order to push and collect monitoring data , accounts are created on the remote servers and credentials of these remote servers are stored in Watch4net. These credentials are encrypted using a fixed hardcoded password. If an attacker manages to obtain a copy of the encrypted credentials , it is trivial to decrypt them. ， Details ， Due to insecure use of cryptography the credentials of these remote host can be decrypted using the Java",
