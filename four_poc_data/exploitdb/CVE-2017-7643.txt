This ， binary serves a single purpose which is to load and unload Proxifier's kernel ， extension. ， Unfortunately it does this by taking the first parameter passed to it on the ， commandline without any sanitisation and feeding it straight into system (  ) . ， This means not only can you load any arbitrary kext as a non-root user but you ， can also get a local root shell. ， Although this is a bit of a terrible bug that shouldn't be happening in 2017 ,  ， Proxifier's developers fixed the issue in record time so that's something !  ， Everyone using Proxifier for Mac should update to 2.19 as soon as possible. ， 6040180f672a2b70511a483e4996d784f03e04c624a8c4e01e71f50709ab77c3 ，  #  !
