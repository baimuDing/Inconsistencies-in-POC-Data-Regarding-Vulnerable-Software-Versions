    "text": "ecve : CVE-2001-0082 ， title : Check Point Software Firewall-1 4.1 SP2 - Fast Mode TCP Fragment - Multiple remote Exploit ， verified : Verified ， exploit_detail : // source :  ， Check Point Software's VPN-1 and Firewall-1 products contain a vulnerability in their \"Fast Mode\" option that may allow an attacker to bypass access control restrictions and access certain blocked services. Fast Mode is a setting that turns off analysis of packets in tcp sessions after the TCP 3-way handshake has completed for speed-crtitical services. ， If this setting is enabled on a firewall , it may be possible for a remote attacker to access blocked services on the host protected by the firewall using fastmode. It is also reportedly possible to access hosts at least one hop away on the same interface as the target host being protected. ， In order for this to be possible , at least one TCP service on a host protected by the firewall must be accessible by the attacker to which a SYN can be sent legitimately. The vulnerability is due to a failure to handle malformed fragmented TCP segments. ， This vulnerability may allow attackers to access vulnerable services normally protected by the firewall ruleset. ， Check Point Software contacted SecurityFocus with an update regarding this issue. Check the solutions section for the update.",
