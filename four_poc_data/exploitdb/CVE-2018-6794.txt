Open Source and owned by a community run non-profit foundation , the Open Information Security Foundation ( OISF ) . Suricata is developed by the OISF , its supporting vendors and the community ， Attack Description :  ， If as a server side you break a normal TCP 3 way handshake packets order and inject some response data before 3whs is complete then data still will be received by the a client but some IDS engines may skip content checks on that. ， Attack scenario TCP flow scheme :  ， Client -> [ SYN ]  [ Seq=0 Ack= 0 ] -> Evil Server ， Client <- [ SYN , ACK ]  [ Seq=0 Ack= 1 ] <- Evil Server ， Client <- [ PSH , ACK ]  [ Seq=1 Ack= 1 ] <- Evil Server # Injection before the 3whs is completed ， Client <- [ FIN , ACK ]  [ Seq=83 Ack= 1 ] <- Evil Server ， Client -> [ ACK ]  [ Seq=1 Ack= 84 ] -> Evil Server ， Client -> [ PSH , ACK ]  [ Seq=1 Ack= 84 ] -> Evil Server ， IDS signature checks for tcp stream or http response body will be skipped in the case of data injection. This attack technique requires all three packets from a malicious server to be received by a client side together before it completes 3whs. Proof of concept server was written in C to",
