Because of a format-string vulnerability when calling the 'syslog (  ) ' function , a remote attacker can execute code as root. ， The 'rpc.statd' server is an RPC server that implements the Network Status and Monitor RPC protocol. It's a component of the Network File System ( NFS ) architecture. ， The logging code in 'rpc.statd' uses the 'syslog (  ) ' function , passing it as the format string user-supplied data. A malicious user can construct a format string that injects executable code into the process address space and overwrites a function's return address , thus forcing the program to execute the code. ， The 'rpc.statd' server requires root privileges for opening its network socket , but fails to drop these privileges later on. Therefore , code run by the malicious user will execute with root privileges. ， Debian , Red Hat , and Connectiva have all released advisories. Presumably , any Linux distribution that runs the statd process is vulnerable unless patched for the problem. ， / *  ，  * Slightly dysfunctional rpc.statd exploit ，  * for all the dysfunctional script kiddies out there ，  * Author : drow , 07/2000 ，  * And just for kicks... ，  * Greets :  ，  * Chris Evans , whose fault all this is ，  * whoever wrote the old solaris statd exploit I ripped the RPC code out of ，  * <james> send out greetz to all the 1337 D3B14N H4X0R2 !  !  !  !  ，  * and THEM ( THEY know who THEY are )  ，  * This is dedicated to Joel Klecker. Those who knew him know why. ，  * /",
