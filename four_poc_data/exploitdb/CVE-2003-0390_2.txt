    "text": "ecve : CVE-2003-0390 ， title : Libopt.a 3.1x - Error Logging Buffer Overflow ( 2 ) - Linux local Exploit ， verified : Verified ， exploit_detail : source :  ， Libopt library has been reported prone to a buffer overflow vulnerability. ， It has been reported that several Libopt.a error logging functions , may be prone to buffer overflow vulnerabilities when handling excessive data. The data may be supplied as an argument to a program linked to the vulnerable library. This condition arises from a lack of sufficient bounds checking performed on the user-supplied data , before it is copied into a memory buffer. As a result the bounds of an internal stack-based memory buffer may be overflowed and adjacent memory corrupted with attacker supplied data. It should be noted that no SUID applications linked to this library are currently known. ， Although unconfirmed this vulnerability may be exploited to execute arbitrary attacker supplied code. ， It should be noted that although this vulnerability was reported to affect Libopt.a version 3.18 previous versions might also be affected. ，  #  ! /usr/bin/perl ，  # expl-optatoi.pl : opt_atoi (  ) function exploit ( from Options Parsing ，  # Tool shared library opt-3.18 and prior ) for this vulnerable code. ，  # vuln.c :  ，  # main ( int * argc , char argv )  ，  # { ，  # / * use OPT opt_atoi (  )  * / ，  # int y = opt_atoi ( argv [ 1 ]  )  ; ",
