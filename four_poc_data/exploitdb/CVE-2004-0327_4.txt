However , a problem has been discovered that may allow an attacker to bypass these restrictions to gain unauthorized access to areas of the filesystem that are restricted when PHP 'safe_mode' is enabled. ， In particular , the MySQL client library that ships with PHP fails to properly honor 'safe_mode'. As a result , a user can issue a LOAD DATA statement to read files that reside in restricted areas of the filesystem ( as determined by 'safe_mode' ) . ，  * /",
