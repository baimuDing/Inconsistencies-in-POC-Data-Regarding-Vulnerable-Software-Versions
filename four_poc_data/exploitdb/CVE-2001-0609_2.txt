If an attacker sets up a remote machine that returns specific format strings instead of a valid username , and connects to cfingerd from that machine , he can exploit the format string bugs. Because cfingerd runs as root , this means the attacker gains full control of the cfingerd host. ， An exploit is available against x86 versions of cfingerd. ， / * remote exploit for linux/x86 - cfingerd <= 1.4.3 ，  * coded by venomous of rdC - 16/apr/01 ，  * Its just a common formatstring bug using syslog (  ) incorrectly. ，  * We need to bind as identd , so disable your identd in case you are ，  * using it. ，  * BONUS : eip address is bruteforced , so relax and wait = )  ，  * NOTE : for sure where we control the format string will change from ，  * platform to platform. ，  * And for sure , the shellcode address will change so maybe you ，  * want to bruteforce this too. ( -1500 to +1500 should be fine i guess )  ，  * REMEMBER : this code is for educational propourses only , do not use ，  * it on machines without authorization. ，  * INFO : cfingerd isnt a package of slackware 7.0 ，  * cfingerd 1.4.1 is a package of debian 2.2 ，  * Greets : ka0z , bruj0 , dn0 , superluck , fugitivo (  !  )  ，  *  # flatline ,  # rdC",
