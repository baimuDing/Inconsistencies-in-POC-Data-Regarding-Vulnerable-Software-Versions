[ Electronic Souls ] .... :  : .. ， - Prozilla vs. Gentoo Security round 2 !  @  #  ， Sometime ago there was a private exploit for Prozilla and due to some ， kiddo who randomly 0wned ppl , all ended up with a Gentoo Security Advisory. ， The exploit got released with a note to another bug in the code. ， Well the 31337 Gent00 Security Team claimed to have audited the code ， and put Prozilla back to portage as fixed. ， The buffer overflow has been fixed ( wow what an effort ) but the other ， bug is still there !  ， Well this either means they dont know what format string bugs are and ， how to spot them ( maybe you should better use automated t00lz , if you cant ， do it yourself , as they would have spotted it for sure : P )  , or they ， simply are lazy and dont give a fuck about your security. ， We support Anti-Disclosure , but this bug isnt of much use anymore and we ， feel like people should know that they better audit code themselfes before ， trusting a Gentoo security fix. Even a automated audit application ， would have done a better job. ， Hey Gentoo , maybe you should try and enlighten yourself about ， format bugs , instead of pretending : P ， But then again , if everyone would audit as g00d as you guys , we'd ， have a lot more fun ;  )  ，  * / ， / *  ， Prozilla <= 1.3.7.3 format string exploit ， Deicide [ ElectronicSouls ]  ， Not reliable as the previous stack overflow exploit. ， Isnt it funny that gentoo sec. team + proz developers couldnt spot ， the format ? ， Homepage : www.siyahsapka.org |  | deicide.siyahsapka.org",
