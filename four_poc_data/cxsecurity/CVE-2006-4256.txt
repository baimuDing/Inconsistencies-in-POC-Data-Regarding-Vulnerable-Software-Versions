    "text": "vul_name : Horde Framework and Horde IMP /index.php cross site referencing ， vul_cve : CVE-2006-4256 ， vul_poc : Horde Framework and Horde IMP /index.php cross site referencing ， scip AG Vulnerability ID 2456 ( 08/16/2006 )  ， I. INTRODUCTION ， Horde is an open-source web application framework based on PHP. It ， offers popular applications , such as the Horde IMP mail client , a ， groupware and wiki solution. ， More information is available on the official Horde product web site at ， the following URL :  ， II. DESCRIPTION ， Marc Ruef found several web-based vulnerabilities that were identified ， in Horde 3.0.4 and verified for all versions prior to 3.1.2 and IMP ， prior to 4.1.3. ， Horde is using a frameset to present the output to the user. The top ， frame has the name horde_menu and the bottom frame has the name ， horde_main. The main file index.php allows the definition of a source by ， using the PHP variable $ _GET [ 'url' ] . An attacker might be able to do a ， cross referencing and inserting malicous web site ressources. ， This is very useful within technical supported phishing attacks. The ， legitimate user might not be able to determine the real source of the ， presentation. And therefore the attacker might be able to intercept the ， communication and fetch some sensitive data. ， III. EXPLOITATION ， Classic script injection techniques within a browser session can be used ， to exploit this vulnerabilities. [ 1 , 2 ]  ， A plugin for our open-source exploiting framework \"Attack Tool Kit\" ，  ( ATK ) will be published in the near future. [ 3 ]  ， IV. IMPACT ， Because non-authenticated parts of the software are affected too , this ， vulnerabilities are serious for every secure environment. ， Non-authenticated users might be able to exploit this flaw to gain ， elevated privileges ( e.g. extracting sensitive cookie information or ， launch a buffer overflow attack against another web browser ) . ， The other parts are affecting authenticated parts. This requires a ， legitimate user to exploit the vulnerabilities. However , because cross ， site scripting attacks could be launched from external attackers , these ， vulnerabilities still become a high risk rating. ， V. DETECTION ， Detection of web based attacks requires a specialized web proxy and/or ， intrusion detection system. Patterns for such a detection are available ， and easy to implement. ， VI. SOLUTION ， The cross site scripting vulnerability ( 4 ) has been fixed in CVS HEAD ，  ( Juli 2006 ) and FRAMEWORK_3. The other vulnerabilities were addressed in ， the current release 3.1.2 and IMP 4.1.3. ， VII. VENDOR RESPONSE ， The Horde team has been informed at 07/04/2006 via email to ， security-at-horde.org. A first response came back on the same day. ， Several email messages were exchanged to discuss the vulnerabilities and ， to co-ordinate the disclosure of this advisory. ， VIII.
