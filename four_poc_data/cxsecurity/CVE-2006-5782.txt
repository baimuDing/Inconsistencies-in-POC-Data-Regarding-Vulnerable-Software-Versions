Authentication is not required to exploit this ， vulnerability. The CCM server is not affected. ， The specific flaw exists within the Radia Notify Daemon , radexecd.exe ,  ， which binds to TCP port 3465 on default CCM device installs. The ， vulnerable daemon expects to receive data in the following format :  ， portx00usernamex00passwordx00command ， Where 'port' specifies a connect back port on the connecting client. ， Due to a design flaw a correct username and password is not required in ， order to execute arbitrary commands within the radexecd.exe install ， directory. This exposes at least two pre-authentication issues. The ， first , allows attackers to reboot affected devices by launching ， radbootw.exe , which reboots the system without any further prompts. The ， second , allows attackers to generate an arbitrary file by launching ， radcrecv.exe. radcrecv will listen to an arbitrary port as specified on ， the command line and receive files via multicast download. The filename ， and contents can be specified by the attacker and is saved to the same ， directory as radexecd.exe. Once a malicious file has been generated , it ， can then be launched as before.",
