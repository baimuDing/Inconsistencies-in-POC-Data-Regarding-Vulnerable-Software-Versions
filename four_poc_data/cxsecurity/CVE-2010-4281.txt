It allows monitoring in a ， visual way the status and performance of several parameters from ， different operating systems , servers , applications and hardware systems ， such as firewalls , proxies , databases , web servers or routers. ， It can be deployed in almost any operating system. It features remote ， monitoring ( WMI , SNMP , TCP. UDP , ICMP , HTTP. ) and it can also use ， agents. An agent is available for each platform. It can also monitor ， hardware systems with a TCP/IP stack , such as load balancers , routers ,  ， network switches , printers or firewalls. ， This software has several servers that process and get information from ， different sources , using WMI for gathering remote Windows information , a ， predictive server , a plug-in server which makes complex user-defined ， network tests , an advanced export server to replicate data between ， different sites of Pandora FMS , a network discovery server , and an SNMP ， Trap console. ， Released under the terms of the GNU General Public License , Pandora FMS ， is free software. ， 5 ) Path Traversal :  ， 5.1 - PHP File Inclusion ( or RFI/LFI : Remote/Local file inclusion ) - ， CVE-2010-4281 -CVE-2010-4282 - CVSS 8.5/10 ， Parameter 'page' of ajax.php is not properly sanitizing user-supplied ， input. The function safe_url_extraclean is filtering ' : ' character , and ， it doesn't allow to use the string \" to create urls , but allows ， '/' character and an attacker could reference remote resources via ， Windows UNC files , using /servername/resource/file ， Note that the first check in safe_url_extraclean is filtering ' : /' , so ， we can bypass the filter easily doing and it only ， strip the first protocol : /.
