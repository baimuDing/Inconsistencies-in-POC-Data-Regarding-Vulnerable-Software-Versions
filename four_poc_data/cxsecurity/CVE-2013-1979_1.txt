    "text": "vul_name : Multiple Linux setuid output redirection vulnerabilities ， vul_cve : CVE-2013-1979 ， vul_poc : Some of the recent -stable patches are ( surprise !  ) security fixes. ， These were disclosed on the distros list last week. ， CVE-2013-1959 : /proc/<pid>/uid_map has multiple incorrect privilege checks ， Linux 3.8 and various 3.9 rcs are affected , depending on ， configuration. This gives a root shell. ( Actually , it gives a uid 0 ， shell with no capabilities , but that's easy to escalate to full root. )  ， Fixed by :  ， commit 935d8aabd4331f47a89c3e1daa5779d23cf244ee ， Author : Linus Torvalds <torvalds (  ) linux-foundation org> ， Date : Sun Apr 14 10 : 06 : 31 2013 -0700 ， Add file_ns_capable (  ) helper function for open-time capability checking ， commit 6708075f104c3c9b04b23336bb0366ca30c3931b ， Author : Eric W. Biederman <ebiederm (  ) xmission com> ， Date : Sun Apr 14 13 : 47 : 02 2013 -0700 ， userns : Don't let unprivileged users trick privileged users into ， setting the id_map ， commit e3211c120a85b792978bcb4be7b2886df18d27f0 ， Author : Andy Lutomirski <luto (  ) amacapital net> ， Date : Sun Apr 14 16 : 28 : 19 2013 -0700 ， userns : Check uid_map's opener's fsuid , not the current fsuid ， All three patches are needed. ， There's an exploit at the bottom of this email. To use it , you need ， to supply the program \"zerozeroone\". Doing so is left as an exercise ， to the reader. It can be done on stock installs of Fedora and Ubuntu ， at least. ， CVE-2013-1979 : writes to unix sockets capture euid instead of uid ， This appears to be a regression in 2.6.36 , and the regression was ， backported to various older stable series ( 2.6.35.11 at least ) . It is ， almost certainly exploitable for root on most distributions , although ， the vectors will vary. The fix is :  ， commit 83f1b4ba917db5dc5a061a44b3403ddb6e783494 ， Author : Linus Torvalds <torvalds (  ) linux-foundation org> ， Date : Fri Apr 19 15 : 32 : 32 2013 +0000 ， net : fix incorrect credentials passing ， I don't have an exploit , but there's a PoC below that demonstrates the issue. ， There's another security buglet that probably has extremely low ， impact. It doesn't have ( and shouldn't need ) a CVE number. It's ， fixed here :  ， commit 41c21e351e79004dbb4efa4bc14a53a7e0af38c5 ， Author : Andy Lutomirski <luto (  ) amacapital net> ， Date : Sun Apr 14 11 : 44 : 04 2013 -0700",
