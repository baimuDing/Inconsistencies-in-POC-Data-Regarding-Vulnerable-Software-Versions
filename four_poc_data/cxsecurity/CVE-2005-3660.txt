BACKGROUND ， Linux is a clone of the operating system Unix , written from scratch by ， Linus Torvalds with assistance from a loosely-knit team of hackers ， across the Net. It aims towards POSIX and Single UNIX Specification ， compliance. ， More information is available from the vendor website :  ， II. DESCRIPTION ， Local exploitation of a memory exhaustion vulnerability in Linux Kernel ， versions 2.4 and 2.6 can allow attackers to cause a denial of service ， condition. ， The vulnerability specifically exists due to a lack of resource checking ， during the buffering of data for transfer over a pair of sockets. An ， attacker can create a situation that , depending on the amount of ， available system resources , can cause the kernel to panic due to memory ， resource exhaustion. The attack is conducted by opening up a number of ， connected file descriptors or socketpairs and creating the largest ， possible kernel buffer for the data transfer between the two sockets. By ， causing the process to enter a zombie state or closing the file ， descriptor while keeping a reference open , the data is kept in the ， kernel until the transfer can complete. If done repeatedly , system ， memory resources can be exhausted from the kernel. ， III. ANALYSIS ， Successful exploitation requires an attacker to have local access to an ， affected Linux system and can result in complete system denial of ， service. The system may not reboot after successful exploitation ,  ， requiring human interaction to be restored to a working state. Depending ， on available resources , systems with large amounts of physical memory ， may not be affected. ， IV. DETECTION ， iDefense has confirmed that Linux 2.4.22 and Linux 2.6.12 are ， vulnerable. ， V. WORKAROUND ， An effective workaround is not available for this vulnerability. ， VI. VENDOR RESPONSE ， The maintainer acknowledges that this issue is a design limitation in ， the Linux kernel. The following advice has been offered for creating a ， patch. It should be noted that this patch has not been fully tested. ， The patch requires three steps :  ， 1 ) Add a \"struct user * \" reference to the \"struct file\" file structure.",
