This vulnerability makes it possible for an unauthenticated attacker to craft a request that contains malicious JavaScript. If the attacker is able to trick a site administrator or user into performing an action , the malicious JavaScript executes , making it possible for the attacker to create new admin users , redirect victims , or engage in other harmful attacks. ， We sent the full disclosure details to the developer on January 6 , 2022 after the vendor confirmed the inbox for handling the discussion. They were quick to acknowledge the report and released a fix on January 10 , 2022. ， We strongly recommend ensuring that your site has been updated to the latest patched version of Profile Builder User Profile & User Registration Forms , which is version 3.6.5 at the time of this publication. ， Description : Reflected Cross-Site Scripting ， Affected Plugin : Profile Builder User Profile & User Registration Forms ， Plugin Slug : profile-builder ， Plugin Developer : Cozmoslabs ， Affected Versions : <= 3.6.1 ， CVE ID : CVE-2022-0653 ， CVSS Score : 6.1 ( Medium )  ， CVSS Vector : CVSS : 3.1/AV : N/AC : L/PR : N/UI : R/S : C/C : L/I : L/A : N ， Researcher/s : Chloe Chamberland ， Fully Patched Version : 3.6.2 ， Profile Builder User Profile & User Registration Forms is a plugin designed to add enhanced user profile and registration capabilities to a WordPress site. The vulnerability in the plugin was simple. ， The plugin added a file ~ /assets/misc/fallback-page.php which was used as a fallback page in the instance that there was no activation page selected for the user activation email functionality. Unfortunately , this file used the user supplied value from the site_url parameter with insufficient sanitization/escaping and validation in an href attribute which meant that it was possible for attackers to use the JavaScript pseudo protocol , javascript :  , to inject malicious scripts. ， Due to the fact that the attacker could also control some of the data on the page via the site_name and message parameter , an attacker could format it to look like it was a 404 page containing a link that the user needs to click in order to return to the site , which helps make it significantly less suspicious than other possible ways the payload could have been presented. If a user clicked the link from \"Click here\" it would trigger the execution of the JavaScript. ， Example of exploit (  )  ， Cross-Site Scripting vulnerabilities can be exploited to perform several actions like creating new administrative user accounts , injecting theme and plugin files with backdoors , and redirecting visitors to malicious sites , all of which can be used for complete site takeover. This vulnerability requires users to click on a link in order to be successful , and is a reminder for site administrators and users to follow security best practices and avoid clicking on links from untrusted sources. ， This vulnerability could also be used to redirect the user to a malicious site by simply injecting any domain in the site_url parameter. ， Timeline ， January 4 , 2022 Conclusion of the plugin analysis that led to the discovery of a Reflected Cross-Site Scripting Vulnerability in the Profile Builder User Profile & User Registration Forms plugin.
