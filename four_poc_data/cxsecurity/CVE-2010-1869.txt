    "text": "vul_name : Ghostscript , multiple arbitrary code execution vulnerabilities ， vul_cve : CVE-2010-1628 ， vul_poc : = ， Ghostscript , multiple arbitrary code execution vulnerabilities ， May 11 , 2010 ， CVE-2010-1869 ， =Description= ， Ghostscript ( www.ghostscript.com )  , an interpreter for the PostScript language ,  ， is vulnerable to two memory corruption vulnerabilities :  ， 1. A stack overflow in the parser for Ghostscript versions 8.64 and 8.70 occurs ， when very long identifiers are provided within a PostScript file. By enticing ， a user to open a maliciously crafted PostScript file , arbitrary code execution ， can be achieved. This vulnerability was reported to downstream distributions ， by me on March 4 , 2010. An anonymous researcher independently published this ， vulnerability today ( May 11 , 2010 )  , prompting this advisory. This issue has ， been assigned CVE-2010-1869. ， 2. GhostScript ( all tested versions ) fails to properly handle infinitely ， recursive procedure invocations. By providing a PostScript file with a ， sequence such as :  ， /A{pop 0 A 0} bind def ， /product A 0 ， the interpreter's internal stack will be overflowed with recursive calls , at ， which point execution will jump to an attacker-controlled address. This ， vulnerability can be exploited by enticing a user to open a maliciously crafted ， PostScript file , achieving arbitrary code execution. This issue has not yet ， been assigned a CVE identifier. ， =Solution= ， In the absence of a patch , users are encouraged to discontinue use of ， Ghostscript or avoid processing untrusted PostScript files. ， =Credits= ， These vulnerabilities were discovered by Dan Rosenberg ，  ( dan.j.rosenberg ( at ) gmail ( dot ) com [ email concealed ]  ) . ， =Timeline= ， 3/04/10 - Initial report to downstream distribution ， 5/11/10 - Anonymous researcher discloses first issue ， 5/11/10 - Disclosure ， CVE identifier CVE-2010-1869 has been assigned to the first issue. ， The original report for this bug can be found at : ",
