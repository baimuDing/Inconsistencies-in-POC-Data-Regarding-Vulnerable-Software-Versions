Instead of them being limited to 1/4th of a 32bit ， address space , they're limited to 1/4th of a 64bit address space - oops !  ， in combination with vanilla ASLR , it triggers a BUG (  ) as the stack ， tries to expand around the address space when shifted ， Below mmap_min_addr you say? uh oh !  ;  )  ， Reported to Ted Tso in December 2009 ， Linus today ( Aug 13 2010 ) silently fixes tangential issue :  ， The second bug here is that the memory usage explodes within the ， kernel from a single 128k allocation in userland ， The explosion of memory isn't accounted for by any task so it won't ， be terminated by the OOM killer ， curious what actual vuln was involved that they were trying ， to silently fix , as I don't think it's the one below ， clobbering data in a suid app by growing the stack into the mapping ， ulimit -s unlimited ， ./64bit_dos ， SELinux is here to save us though with its fine-grained controls !  ， Wait , it doesn't? ， Clearly the solution is to throw a buggy KVM on top of it ， Not enough? Ok , we'll throw in an extra SELinux , that'll really ， throw those hackers off when they use the same exact exploit on the ， host as they do on the guest !  ， COMMON CRITERIA HERE I COME ! ",
