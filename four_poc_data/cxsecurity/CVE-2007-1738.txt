I tested this on the latest ， version , 4.3 , which corrected another vulnerability , but it still seems ， insecure. ， The following command mounts a file-based container over /usr/bin. This can be ， done by a non-root user provided TrueCrypt is in set-uid mode , and the file ， container does not have to contain any files :  ， tim # truecrypt -u myvolume.tc /usr/bin ， This could result in system binaries becoming inaccessible , or if the user ， has copied his own binaries into the file container , they could potentially ， replace legitimate system binaries with malicious ones , e.g. a /usr/bin/sudo ， that does something nasty. ， To do this I did the following ( as non-root ) . ，  # truecrypt -c # create a FAT32 volume called test.tc ，  # truecrypt -u test.tc tmpdir # mount in a tmp dir in my home dir",
