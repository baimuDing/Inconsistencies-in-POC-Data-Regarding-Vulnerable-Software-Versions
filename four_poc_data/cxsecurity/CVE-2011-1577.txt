The code for evaluating EFI GUID partition tables contains a buffer ， overflow bug that allows to cause kernel oops resulting in a denial of ， service. ， Workaround ， Compile and use a kernel that does not evaluate EFI GUID partition ， tables. The corresponding configuration key is CONFIG_EFI_PARTITION. ， Solution ， A patch is available at ， When further information becomes available , this advisory will be ， updated. The most recent version of this advisory is available at :  ， Contact ， PRE-CERT can be reached under precert ( at ) pre-secure ( dot ) de. [ email concealed ] For PGP key ， information , refer to",
