The application does not correctly handle certain escape sequences which can lead to an unprivileged guest VM being able to gain code execution in the fully privileged Dom0 allowing the entire hosting server to be controlled. ， It should be noted that the vulnerable code was also used in the QEMU-KVM terminal that can be used by emulated virtual machines ; this is under a different CVE , CVE-2012-3515. ， Technologies Affected ， Citrix XenServer 6.0 ， Citrix XenServer 5.6 ， Citrix XenServer 5.5 ， Citrix XenServer 5.0 ， Vendor Response ， Vendor issued a security hot fix of the 5th September 2012. See for support information and download locations for different versions of XenServer.",
