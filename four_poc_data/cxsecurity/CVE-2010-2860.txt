The IP addresses ， are intended for communication internal to the appliance , but are still ， accepted from external sources. An attacker can mount this file system by ， spoofing an authorized IP address. ， The NFS showmount command can be used to obtain a list of the IP addresses :  ，  # showmount -e <Celerra IP address> ， Export list for <Celerra IP address> :  ， / 128.221.253.101 , 128.221.252.101 , 128.221.253.100 , 128.221.252.100 ， Because the appliance's NFS server does not enable the \"rootsquash\" feature ,  ， full access to the file system is possible by mounting the export using root ，  ( UID 0 ) . ， Fully spoofing the source IP address ( for sending and receiving packets )  ， will",
