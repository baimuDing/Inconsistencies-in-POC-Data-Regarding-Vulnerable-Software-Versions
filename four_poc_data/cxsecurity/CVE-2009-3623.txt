    "text": "vul_name : linux kernel 2.6.25.15 nfsd4 : fix null dereference creating nfsv4 callback ， vul_cve : CVE-2009-3623 ， vul_poc :  ， Quoting from upstream patch :  ， \"On setting up the callback to the client , we attempt to use the same ， authentication flavor the client did. We find an rpc cred to use by ， calling rpcauth_lookup_credcache (  )  , which assumes that the given ， authentication flavor has a credentials cache. However , this is not ， required to be true-in particular , auth_null does not use one. Instead ,  ， we should call the auth's lookup_cred (  ) method. ， Without this , a client attempting to mount using nfsv4 and auth_null ， triggers a null dereference.\" ， The code was introduced in upstream commit 3cef9ab2 ( v2.6.31-rc1 )  , fixed ， in 886e3b7f ( v2.6.32-rc1 )  , and was later replaced by 80fc015b in the ， same version. ， Thanks , Eugene",
