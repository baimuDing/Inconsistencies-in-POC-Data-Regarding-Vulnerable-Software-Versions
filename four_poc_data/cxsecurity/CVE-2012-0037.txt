The ， supported parsing syntaxes are RDF/XML , N-Quads , N-Triples , TRiG , Turtle , RSS ， tag soup including all versions of RSS , Atom 1.0 and 0.3 , GRDDL and ， microformats for HTML , XHTML and XML and RDFa. The serializing syntaxes are ， RDF/XML ( regular , and abbreviated )  , Atom 1.0 , GraphViz , JSON , N-Quads ,  ， N-Triples , RSS 1.0 and XMP.\" - libraptor web site [ 1 ]  ， libraptor is a component of librdf [ 2 ] which is used by a variety of open source ， software to interpret Resource Description Framework ( RDF )  [ 3 ] formats. ， Vulnerability Overview ， In December 2011 , VSR identified a vulnerability in multiple open source office ， products ( including OpenOffice , LibreOffice , KOffice , and AbiWord ) due to unsafe ， interpretation of XML files with custom entity declarations. Deeper analysis ， revealed that the vulnerability was caused by acceptance of external entities by ， the libraptor library , which is used by librdf and is in turn used by these ， office products. ， In the context of office applications , these vulnerabilities could allow for XML ， External Entity ( XE ) attacks resulting in file theft and a loss of user privacy ， when opening potentially malicious ODF documents. For other applications which ， depend on librdf or libraptor , potentially serious consequences could result ， from accepting RDF/XML content from untrusted sources , though the impact may ， vary widely depending on the context. ， Vulnerability Details ， Open Document Format ( ODF ) files consist of a collection of several different ， files stored in a ZIP archive. Included in this set is a \"manifest.rdf\" file ， which is formatted according to the RDF/XML representation. The RDF format is ， intended to be used for storing metadata associated with specific document ， elements. The manifest.rdf file can reference secondary RDF files within the ， ODF file as well as external document schemas. ， The RDF file parser ( librdf ) used by the affected office products allows DTD ， specifications within the RDF files themselves. In addition , the parser ， interprets external entities which may reference arbitrary external files , HTTP ， and FTP resources. ， For instance , the following \"evil.rdf\" file was created within a valid ODF text ， archive ( .odt file ) which was referenced by the internal manifest.rdf file :  ， <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?>",
