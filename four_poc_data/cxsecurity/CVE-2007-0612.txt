    "text": "vul_name : Internet Explorer 7 ActiveX bgColor property NULL pointer dereference ( DoS )  ， vul_cve : CVE-2007-0612 ， vul_poc : I thought that after the success of MoBB last year , fuzzing browsers will be ， pointless , since all vendors would take care of the easily-found bugs before a ， release. It turns out that I was wrong. I ran a very simple ActiveX fuzzer ， against Vista and found a NULL pointer dereference bug in no time. The ， vulnerable ActiveX control is on the pre-approved list in IE7 , which makes the ， bug easy to trigger with no security warnings and no user interaction. ， Try this :  ， <script language=\"JavaScript\"> ， obj = new ActiveXObject ( \"giffile\" )  ;  ， obj.bgColor ;  ， </script> ， MSRC said that this is a reliability bug and not a security issue , and it will ， be fixed at some point in the future. I agree that DoS bugs against IE are not ， very important ( as long as skape doesn't drop any more vulns like MS06-051 : - )  ,  ， but it's interesting that such a simple bug in such an obvious part of the IE7 ， attack surface was not discovered and fixed before the release. ， See the full technical details at ， or.html ， More about fuzzers and ActiveX at ， Alexander Sotirov ， Determina Security Research",
