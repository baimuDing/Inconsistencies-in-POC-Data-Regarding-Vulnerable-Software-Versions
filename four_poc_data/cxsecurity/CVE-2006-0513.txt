Comprehensive network security can be provided by ， having Tivoli Access Manager Plug-in for Web Servers control the ， authentication and authorization of clients.\" ， Vulnerability Overview :  ， On December 1st , while conducting a penetration test of a TAM enabled web ， application , VSR identified a vulnerability in Tivoli Web Server Plug-in ， which is a component of Tivoli Access Manager ( TAM ) . This flaw allows an ， authenticated attacker to retrieve files ( which reside outside of the web ， root ) from the web server on which the plug-in resides. It is ， possible to ， retrieve any file or list any directory which is readable by the web ， server ， software. ， Vulnerability Details :  ， IBM's TAM Plug-in contains a logout handler under the root web path named ， `pkmslogout'. This handler is designed to log out authenticated users. ， The handler's display template can be specified by the `filename' request ， parameter. The value of this parameter is intended to be the partial path ， to a file on the web server which contains the page template. This file ， path is vulnerable to directory traversal , and can be used to retrieve ， nearly arbitrary files from the web server hosting the TAM Plug-in. ， For instance , if a vulnerable plug-in existed on the system ， tam.example.com ,  ， one could exploit the problem by hitting a URL such as :  ， wd ， It appears this problem can only be triggered when the attacker is ， already authenticated through the Web Plug-in.",
