    "text": "vul_name : ibm db2 9.7 Exploiting the linker ， vul_cve : CVE-2011-4061 ， vul_poc : I've recently been working on a paper on Linux and POSIX linkers , the most ， recent release of which can be found at :  ， I'm particularly interested in feedback on references or threats that I may ， have missed. As per the abstract , the aim of the paper wasn't to claim ， everything as my own but rather to document as much as possible about common ， flaws and how to identify them. ， Whilst working on the paper I came across a number of interesting bugs ( some ， exploitable , others sadly not ) . The paper itself touches on the circumstances ， around CVE-2011-1126 but two other bugs also mentioned in the paper ( one of ， which I released the advisory NDSA20110310 for ) are potentially more useful so ， I've written PoC to exploit them :  ， 1 ) - Privesc attack using ， DB2 from normal user to root , the PoC is for Linux but based on testing the ， AIX version looks iffy too although I couldn't get gcc to generate a valid ， library to exploit it. ， 2 ) - Generic attack on the ， QNX runtime linker which abuses an arbitrary file overwrite and race condition ， to get root. ， The paper is still a work in progress but both DB2 and QNX are available for ， download if you want to take them for a spin. Anyway , enjoy !  ， Tim ， Tim Brown ， <mailto : timb ( at ) nth-dimension.org ( dot ) uk [ email concealed ] > ， <",
