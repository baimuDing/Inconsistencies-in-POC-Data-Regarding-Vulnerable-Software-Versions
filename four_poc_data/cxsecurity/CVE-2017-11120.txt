    "text": "vul_name : iPhone 7 and Samsung Galaxy S7 Wi-Fi Chip Hack ， vul_cve : CVE-2017-11120 ， vul_poc : Broadcom produces Wi-Fi HardMAC SoCs which are used to handle the PHY and MAC layer processing. These chips are present in both mobile devices and Wi-Fi routers , and are capable of handling many Wi-Fi related events without delegating to the host OS. ， In order to allow fast roaming between access points in a wireless network , the Broadcom firmware supports the Fast BSS Transition feature ( IEEE 802.11r-2008 FT ) as well as the Radio Resource Management standard ( IEEE 802.11k-2008 RRM ) . Much of the information related to RRM is transferred by means of Wi-Fi Action Frames , using the RRM category ( 5 ) . ， One such frame which is handled by Broadcom's firmware is the \"RRM Neighbor Report Response\" frame , which has following general structure :  ，  | Category ( 5 )  | Action ( 5 )  | Dialog Token | Neighbor Report Elements |  ， 0 1 2 3 X ，  ( See 802.11-2016 , 9.6.7.7 , 9.4.2.37 for more information ) . ， On the BCM4355C0 SoC with firmware version 9.44.78.27.0.1.56 the RRM Neighbor Report Response frame is handled by RAM function 0x1B0FE8 ( which delegates to ROM function 0xABBBC ) . This function verifies the dialog token ( although that is a single byte field , so it can be easily brute-forced by an attacker if they do not know it in advance ) . Then , the function copies over the contents of the Neighbor Report Response frame into a heap-allocated buffer and subsequently calls an internal ROM function at 0xAC0A8 to store the number of neighbors for each given \"Operating Class\" ( see 9.4.2.37 ) .",
