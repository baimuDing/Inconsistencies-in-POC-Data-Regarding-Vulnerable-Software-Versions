Morgan <tmorgan ( a ) vsecurity . com> ， Vendor Status : Update Released [ 2 ]  ， CVE Candidate : CVE-2010-0556 ， Product Description ， \"Google Chrome is a web browser that runs web pages and applications with ， lightning speed.\" [ 1 ]  ， Vulnerability Overview ， In mid-January , VSR identified a vulnerability in Google Chrome which could be ， used in phishing attacks in specific types of web sites. This issue may make it ， much easier to convince a victim to submit web application credentials to the ， attacker's site. ， Vulnerability Details ， As with many modern browsers , Google Chrome implements a password manager to ， help users keep track of credentials used on various web sites. It may be used ， to store either HTTP authentication credentials or form-based credentials. ， The vulnerability surfaces in a situation where a user visits a web page which ， includes an embedded object , such as an image , from a third-party site. If an ， attacker had control of the third-party web server , he could request credentials ， from the user via HTTP authentication. This style of attack has been documented ， in the past , and some of variations on this theme are explored in a recent paper ， by VSR [ 5 ] . ， However , in the case of vulnerable versions of Google Chrome , the password ， manager may pre-fill the authentication dialog box with credentials intended for ， parent page's domain , leaving users one click away from account compromise. ， This issue would affect Chrome users which use applications that allow users to ， embed objects from third parties. Examples of such applications may include ， message boards , blogs , or social networking sites.",
