The issue with ， ?return= was something that I've previously complained about , and the development team chose not to fix at the time. ， The CVE indicator of 2014 makes it appear that the vulnerability was first identified in 2014 , but in fact , it's one ， that's been known about since a lot earlier - but previous developers argued not to fix I believe ( I'll need to pull ， out a old HDD and go for chat logs to confirm ) . ， For example , I have test web requests stored demonstrating this issue since at least April 2013 ，  (  , and I believe that actually the identification of this issue pre-dates this. ， Therefore , I don't believe it is correct to state that the issue was first reported by & # 8220 ; Mathias Karlsson& # 8221 ; in May 2014 ,  ， when it was identified as an issue prior to April 2013. ， Equally , I don't believe that putting in the description Paul Richards also found another redirection issue in ， permalink_page.php , which turned out to have the same root cause. is a valid indication of the issue - in terms of the ， ?return parameter , Mantis used the same functionality in around 4-5 pages. ， In addition , whilst I did state that I would leave testing of the fix to someone else , the final fix for this issue ， looks rather similar to the proposal fix I suggested for further testing of :  ，  [ 23 : 16 : 46 ] <paulr> if ( preg_match ( ' @ ^ ( ?P<path>' . preg_quote (  $ t_path , ' @ ' ) .
