Forcing the user to set a password ( and fixing the ， authentication bypass ) would go some way to mitigating the risk of ， importbuddy.php not being deleted. ，  # details ， The name of the backup file contains a random string intended to prevent an ， attacker from guessing its value. ， However if backup files are present , browsing to ， expose their filenames ; these can then ， be used to download the files ， from the site :  ， <select name=\"file\" style=\"max-width : 590px ; \"> ， <option ， value=\"backup-zipfile-date-randomstring.zip\">backup-zipfile-date-randomstring.zip</option> ， </select> ， The desired backup file can be retrieved with : wget ， The backup consists of a zip archive containing the wordpress directory ,  ， complete with wp-config.php and often a .sql dump containing a full copy of ， the wordpress database and any other databases the backupbuddy plugin has ， been configured to include. ， Importbuddy also presents the option to upload a backup on step 1 of the ， restoration process , potentially allowing defacement or deletion and also ， trojanning the site if an existing backup is available. ， Additionally there are issues affecting the 'step' query string field. This ， has a differing impact depending on the version of Backupbuddy targeted :  ， - Can be used to avoid the password check on step 1 ( if a password has ， been set ) by passing ?step= [ 2-7 ]  ， - Steps 2 and 3 expose the full path of the wordpress install ， - Skipping to step 7 has the potential to erase the wordpress install ，  ( only known to affect v2.2.4 )  ， - Accessing provides ， phpinfo information ( confirmed on v2.2.25 ) ",
