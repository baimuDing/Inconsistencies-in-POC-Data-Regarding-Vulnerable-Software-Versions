    "text": "vul_name : Apache CXF WSS4JInInterceptor always allows HTTP Get requests ， vul_cve : CVE-2012-5633 ， vul_poc : CVE-2012-5633 : WSS4JInInterceptor always allows HTTP Get requests from browser ， Severity : Critical ， Vendor : The Apache Software Foundation ， Versions Affected :  ， This vulnerability affects all versions of Apache CXF prior to 2.5.8 , 2.6.5 ， and 2.7.2. CXF 2.7.1 is not affected by default , however the vulnerability ， exists if you are explicitly adding the URIMappingInterceptor to the default ， chain. ， Description :  ， The URIMappingInterceptor in CXF is a legacy interceptor that allows some basic ， \"rest style\" access to a simple SOAP service. The functionality provided by ， this interceptor has since been replaced by the JAX-RS standard. ， An example of how this interceptor works is as follows. A simple \"double it\" ， webservice is defined as :  ，  @ WebService ( name = \"DoubleItPortType\" )  ， public interface DoubleItPortType ， Unknown macro : { @ WebMethod ( operationName = \"DoubleIt\" ) public int doubleIt (  @ WebParam ( name = \"numberToDouble\" ) int numberToDouble )  ; } ， The URIMappingInterceptor can allow a REST client access the service via a GET ， request to a URL like :  ， The vulnerability is when a simple SOAP service is secured with the ， WSS4JInInterceptor , which enables WS-Security processing of the request. ， WS-Security processing is completely by-passed in the case of a HTTP GET ， request , and so access to the service can be enabled by the ， URIMappingInterceptor. ， This is a critical vulnerability if you are using a WS-Security UsernameToken ， or a SOAP message signature via the WSS4JInInterceptor to authenticate users ， you are using WS-SecurityPolicy to secure the service , as the relevant policies ， will not be asserted. Also note that this attack is only applicable to ， relatively simple services that can be mapped to a URI via the ， URIMappingInterceptor. ， This has been fixed in revisions :  ， Migration :  ， Although this issue is fixed in CXF 2.5.8 , 2.6.5 and 2.7.2 , due to a separate ， security vulnerability ( CVE-2013-0239 )  , CXF users should upgrade to the ， following versions :  ， Users of CXF prior to 2.5.x should upgrade to either 2.5.9 , 2.6.6 , or 2.7.3. ， CXF 2.5.x users should upgrade to 2.5.9 as soon as possible. ， CXF 2.6.x users should upgrade to 2.6.6 as soon as possible. ， CXF 2.7.x users should upgrade to 2.7.3 as soon as possible.",
