    "text": "vul_name : D-LINK DWL-2000AP+ remote DoS ， vul_cve : CVE-2006-6538 ， vul_poc : D-LINK DWL-2000AP+ with firmware version 2.11 is prone to two remote denial of service vulnerability because it fails to handle arp flooding. ， The first vuln causes the wireless link ( 802.11 ) to be resetted and the arp table to be rebuilded. All clients connected to the AP are disconnected. ， This bug can be triggered by sending lots of arp replies through the wired link or the radio one at a very high speed. ， The second vulnerability affects the wireless link only and are quite harder to trigger but causes the AP firmware to crash making a manual reboot mandatory. ， This bug can be triggered only if no other D-LINK ethernet products are visible to AP , if wep encryption is enabled and it needs a very large amount of arp-requests to be broadcasted through its wireless link at a very high speed. ， This exploit works in the 90% of cases because sometimes the AP is able to ban the flooding client before the exploiting process is complete. ， D-LINK doesn't support this product anymore so no solution is available. ， Other products can be vulnerable. ， Not vulnerable : DWL-700AP ， Proof-of-concept availale ,  ， it floods an ethernet device with arp-reply or arp-request ， cheers ， -poplix",
