While client-side protections are in place , no input validation on the server side is performed. One can leverage other vulnerabilities reported in this platform ( XSS and CSRF ) to exacerbate this issue. The page 'apply.cgi' allows HTML forms to be submitted via both HTTP POST and HTTP GET requests. The following crafted link can be used to pass a value greater than 18 bytes in one of the above-mentioned paramaters causing the HTTP service to stop responding. ， The service will stop responding and become inaccessible for several minutes. After a few minutes , it appears that an automated task such as a CRON job restarts the service. ， Authentication is required to perform this action. The application uses HTTP Basic Authentication , which is weak ( base64-encoded credentials in the format of username : password ) . ， History ， 04/16/2013 : Discovery ， 04/23/2013 : Advisory released ， Cisco/Linksys WRT310N v2 XSS :  ， Cisco/Linksys WRT310N v2 CSRF : ",
