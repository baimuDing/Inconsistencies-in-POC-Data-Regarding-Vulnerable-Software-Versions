    "text": "vul_name : Unauthenticated access to IBM Host On-Demand administration pages ， vul_cve : CVE-2006-6537 ， vul_poc : SUMMARY ， Vulnerability found in : IBM WebSphere Host On-Demand ( HOD )  ， Type : Unauthorized , remote access to HOD administration pages ， Applies to : Version 6.0 , 7.0 , 8.0 , and 9.0 ( possibly 10.0 )  ， Severity Level : High ， Exploit Difficulty : Very Low ， Initial Vendor Notification : approximately 11/3/2006 ， Discovered By : Dave Ferguson , FishNet Security ， Secunia advisory location :  ， BACKGROUND ， IBM's WebSphere Host On-Demand ( HOD ) provides a framework for accessing host applications and data ， from a Java-enabled web browser. The HOD administration pages consist of a set of Java applets. One ， applet controls user authentication. Others allow you to start and stop services , manage users ,  ， configure telnet redirectors , set up LDAP service , and manage licenses. Information about HOD can be ， found here :  ， VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW ， FishNet Security discovered that a remote , unauthenticated user can access and interact with several ， of the HOD administration applets. Essentially , a simple URL manipulation attack can bypass the ， authentication and authorization process. This was found in HOD versions 6.0 , 7.0 , 8.0 , and 9.0. ， Version 10 ( released in 2006 ) may also be vulnerable , but was not tested. ， DETAILS ， The applet that handles user authentication is normally located at the following URL :  ， Once this page loads and the applet is running , the URL showing in ， the web browser reads something like this :  ， =Logon , hgt=480 , wth=640 , full=fa ， lse , BrowserLocale=en.there. The web page displays an area for the user to logon and a menu on the ， left side with several links to other pages/applets. Each of these links is disabled. The links are :  ， - Introduction ， - Users/Groups ， - Services ， - Redirector Service ， - Directory Service ， - OS/400 Proxy Server ， - Licenses ， - Logoff ， To bypass the authentication process , you change the value of \"pnl\" in the current URL. For example ,  ， to see the OS/400 Proxy Server page , you would change the pnl parameter from \"Logon\" to \"os400proxy\". ， The page loads and the functionality of the applet appears to be normal in every way. The other links ， in the menu become enabled , so changing the URL manually is no longer necessary. Two of the ， pages/applets seem to have additional access control , because the applets remain blank and/or empty ， and can't be used. ， Pages that could be accessed in an unauthenticated state :  ， Services , Redirector Service , Directory Service , and OS/400 Proxy Server ， Pages that could NOT be accessed :  ， Users/Groups and Licenses ， ATTACK SCENARIOS ， An attacker can perpetrate a number of actions :  ， - stopping critical HOD services ， - reconfiguring existing services ( e.g. , port numbers , ip addresses )  ， - creating and starting unnecessary services ， - changing the security configuration for redirectors ， - creating a user to administer the LDAP service ， Any of these could have an adverse effect on business operations and/or allow a malicious person to ， open more potential attack vectors. ， VENDOR RESPONSE ， Secunia notified IBM about this vulnerability around 11/3/2006. No response has been received. ， CONTACT ， You can reach the author of this advisory at : dave.ferguson [ at ] fishnetsecurity ( dot ) com",
