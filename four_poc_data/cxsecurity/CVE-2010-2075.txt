    "text": "vul_name : UnrealIRCd 3.2.8.1 backdoored on official ftp and site ， vul_cve : CVE-2010-2075 ， vul_poc : We found out that the Unreal3.2.8.1.tar.gz file on our mirrors has been ， replaced quite a while ago with a version with a backdoor ( trojan ) in it. ， This backdoor allows a person to execute ANY command with the privileges of ， the user running the ircd. The backdoor can be executed regardless of any user ， restrictions ( so even if you have passworded server or hub that doesn't allow ， any users in ) . ， It appears the replacement of the .tar.gz occurred in November 2009 ( at least on some mirrors ) . It seems nobody noticed it until now. ， Obviously , this is a very serious issue , and we're taking precautions so this will never happen again , and if it somehow does that it will be noticed quickly. ， We will also re-implement PGP/GPG signing of releases. Even though in practice ，  ( very ) few people verify files , it will still be useful for those people who do. ， Safe versions ， Official precompiled Windows binaries ( SSL and non-ssl ) are NOT affected. ， CVS is also not affected. ， 3.2.8 and any earlier versions are not affected. ， Any Unreal3.2.8.1.tar.gz downloaded BEFORE November 10 2009 should be safe , but you should really double-check , see next. ， How to check if you're running the backdoored version ， Two ways :  ， One is to check if the Unreal3.2.8.1.tar.gz you have is good or bad by running 'md5sum Unreal3.2.8.1.tar.gz' on it. ， Backdoored version ( BAD ) is : 752e46f2d873c1679fa99de3f52a274d ， Official version ( GOOD ) is : 7b741e94e867c0a7370553fd01506c66 ， The other way is to run this command in your Unreal3.2 directory :  ， grep DEBUG3_DOLOG_SYSTEM include/struct.h ， If it outputs two lines , then you're running the backdoored/trojanized version. ， If it outputs nothing , then you're safe and there's nothing to do. ， What to do if you're running the backdoored version ， Obviously , you only need to do this if you checked you are indeed running the ， backdoored version , as mentioned above. Otherwise there's no point in continuing , as the version on our website is ( now back ) the good one from April 13 2009 and nothing 'new'.",
