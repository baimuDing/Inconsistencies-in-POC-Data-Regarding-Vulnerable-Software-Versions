So this issue is not ， restricted to Microsoft applications. ， In addition certain applications like Microsoft ， Word/Excel/Powerpoint/Project/powershell/. as well as a certain number ， of third party software are prone to remote binary planting due to using ， MSHTML.DLL in some ways. ， Technical Details ， MSHTML.DLL on Windows 7 SP1 has missing dependencies for the following DLLs :  ， API-MS-WIN-APPMODEL-RUNTIME-L1-1-0.DLL ， API-MS-WIN-CORE-WINRT-ERROR-L1-1-0.DLL ， API-MS-WIN-CORE-WINRT-L1-1-0.DLL ， API-MS-WIN-CORE-WINRT-ROBUFFER-L1-1-0.DLL ， API-MS-WIN-CORE-WINRT-STRING-L1-1-0.DLL ， API-MS-WIN-SHCORE-SCALING-L1-1-1.DLL ， DCOMP.DLL ， IESHIMS.DLL ， Since all mentioned DLLs are available on a Windows 10 installation my ， assumption is that this might be due to developing for Windows 10 and ， backporting to Windows 7. ， Whenever an application is using MSHTML.DLL either directly or via ， indirect dependencies from SHELL32.DLL for instance it tries to find ， API-MS-WIN-APPMODEL-RUNTIME-L1-1-0.DLL using the DLL search order ( see [ 3 ]  ) . ， If a user and/or a remote attacker is able to control one directory in ， the system's DLL search path he can escalate privileges from user to ， SYSTEM in case of a vulnerable service running as SYSTEM. ， If a user is tricked to open e.g. a word document from a Windows or even WebDAV ， share holding additionally a malicious DLL named ， API-MS-WIN-APPMODEL-RUNTIME-L1-1-0.DLL it is loaded and executed in the ， user's context.",
