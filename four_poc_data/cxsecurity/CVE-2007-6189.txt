After this file is initialized , it generates the ， GUI for the scanner and manages all User-issued commands. Oscan.ocx has ， also an internal website verification system to prevent the ActiveX ， control from being initialized outside of an authorized domain. ， Unfortunately due to a lack of data-sanitization , OScan.ocx can be ， forced to be initialized in an unsafe domain and it can be manipulated ， to corrupt arbitrary memory locations with user supplied values. This ， could allow a memory corruption scenario that would lead to arbitrary ， code execution or denial of service conditions.",
