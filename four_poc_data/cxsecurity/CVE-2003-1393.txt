Ltd. ， Online location :  ， I. BACKGROUND ， SQLBase 8.1.0 is a fully-relational database management system ( RDBMS )  ,  ， providing complete implementation of Structured Query Language ( SQL ) as well ， as ， its own ， control language. It is designed and built specifically for PC networks ， supporting various LAN/WAN configurations. According to their website , more ， than ， 1 million users have used their technology. ， Execute command executes a stored command or procedure. The syntax of this ， command is :  ， EXECUTE [ auth ID ] .stored_command_or_procedure_name ， Passing an extremely large command/procedure name as the parameter to the ， Execute command crashes SQLBase , giving the attacker System ， Privileges. ， II. DESCRIPTION ， Buffer overflow occurs when the string length exceeds 700 characters.The ， command we executed was as follows :  ， EXECUTE SYSADM.AAAAAAAAAAA. ( 700 times )  ， This was found to be true on a database we had created , but it also ， does exist on the default ISLAND database. This could potentially allow ， execution of system commands with ， privileges of the GuptaSQL Service ( Local System ) . This vulnerability causes ， the SQL Base service to crash thus closing down the database. If not for ， system ， exploitation , it could easily be used for a very simple denial of service ， attack. ， III. ANALYSIS ， Any attacker can exploit this buffer overflow to gain LocalSystem privileges ， on the server. SQLBase runs as a Service with LocalSystem privileges. Also ,  ， the attacker can authenticate by using the SYSADM username and a blank ， password for the default ISLAND database. Or if this database has been ， removed , he must then be a legitimate user. But he need not be the SYSADM ,  ， any ordinary user can execute the overflow. ， IV. DETECTION ， Buffer Overflow in EXECUTE Command was detected in earlier version of ， SQLBase ( v 8.0.0 ) by NII in early January. The vendor released a list of ， patches ， to this version one of which was bug ID 76532B ， However it seems that the vendor has not patched the latest version ， correctly. ， The new version , v 8.1.0 , also has ， a similar vulnerability but it requires 700 characters instead of the ， earlier ， 350 ， V. RECOVERY ， The SQLBase Service crashes and it needs to be then restarted. But since it ， runs with LocalSystem privileges , a buffer overflow in it allows the ， attacker full access to the system. ， VI. VENDOR RESPONSE ， The vendor acknowledged this vulnerability and partially rectified it in ， release 8.1.0. ， LogABug of Gupta WorldWide has given the following ID to this issue. ， Defect ID : 76532B ， This bug has not been properly rectified. In the old 8.0.0 version , the BO ， was at 350 characters , whereas in the new version it takes 700 characters to ， crash the service.",
