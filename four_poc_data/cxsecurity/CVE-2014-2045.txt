This is a normal feature of many applications , however , in this instance the application failed to restrict the type of data that could be stored and also failed to sanitise it , meaning that it could not be safely rendered by the browser. ， Stored cross-site scripting could be triggered by :  ， Attempting to login with a username of `<script>alert ( 1 ) </script>? ( affects `old? interface and results in post-authentication cross-site Scripting when a legitimate administrator views the realtime log )  ， Creating an account with a username of `<script>alert ( 1 ) </script>? ( affects both `old? and `new? interfaces once created )  ， Setting the device?s hostname to `<script>alert ( 1 ) </script>? ( affects `old? interface once created )  ， A number of locations were identified as being vulnerable to reflective attacks , including :  ， The inclusion of session IDs in all URLs partially mitigates the reflective cross-site scripting but could itself be considered a vulnerability since it is included in referred headers and log files. ， These are simply some examples of how this attack might be performed , and the it is believed that both the `old? and `new? web applications are systemically vulnerable to this. ， Further details at :  ， Copyright :  ， Copyright ( c ) Portcullis Computer Security Limited 2015 , All rights reserved worldwide.
