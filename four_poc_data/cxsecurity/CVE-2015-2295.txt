A remote attacker can trick a logged-in administrator to open a specially crafted link and execute arbitrary HTML and script code in browser in context of the vulnerable website. ， PoC code below uses JS \"alert (  ) \" function to display \"ImmuniWeb\" popup :  ， 1.2 Input passed via the \"if\" and \"dragtable\" HTTP GET parameters to \"/firewall_rules.php\" script is not properly sanitised before being returned to the user. A remote attacker can trick a logged-in administrator to open a specially crafted link and execute arbitrary HTML and script code in browser in context of the vulnerable website. ， Below are two PoC codes for each vulnerable parameter that use JS \"alert (  ) \" function to display \"ImmuniWeb\" popup :  ， 1.3 Input passed via the \"queue\" HTTP GET parameter to \"/firewall_shaper.php\" script is not properly sanitised before being returned to the user. A remote attacker can trick a logged-in administrator to open a specially crafted link and execute arbitrary HTML and script code in browser in context of the vulnerable website. ， PoC code below uses JS \"alert (  ) \" function to display \"ImmuniWeb\" popup :  ， 1.4 Input passed via the \"id\" HTTP GET parameter to \"/services_unbound_acls.php\" script is not properly sanitised before being returned to the user. A remote attacker can trick a logged-in administrator to open a specially crafted link and execute arbitrary HTML and script code in browser in context of the vulnerable website. ， PoC code below uses JS \"alert (  ) \" function to display \"ImmuniWeb\" popup :  ， 1.5 Input passed via the \"filterlogentries_time\" , \"filterlogentries_sourceipaddress\" , \"filterlogentries_sourceport\" , \"filterlogentries_destinationipaddress\" , \"filterlogentries_interfaces\" , \"filterlogentries_destinationport\" , \"filterlogentries_protocolflags\" and \"filterlogentries_qty\" HTTP GET parameters to \"/diag_logs_filter.php\" script is not properly sanitised before being returned to the user. A remote attacker can trick a logged-in administrator to open a specially crafted link and execute arbitrary HTML and script code in browser in context of the vulnerable website. ， Below are eight PoC codes for each vulnerable parameter that use JS \"alert (  ) \" function to display \"ImmuniWeb\" popup :  ， 2 ) Cross-Site Request Forgery ( CSRF ) in pfSense : CVE-2015-2295 ， 2.1 The vulnerability exists due to insufficient validation of the HTTP request origin in \"/system_firmware_restorefullbackup.php\" script. A remote attacker can trick a log-in administrator to visit a malicious page with CSRF exploit and delete arbitrary files on the target system with root privileges. ， The following PoC code deletes file \"/etc/passwd\" : ",
