The vulnerabilities can be exploited to execute arbitrary SQL commands in application database , perform a CSRF attack and gain complete control over the web application. ， 1 ) SQL Injection in ISPConfig : CVE-2015-4118 ， The vulnerability exists due to insufficient filtration of input data passed via the \"server\" HTTP GET parameter to \"/monitor/show_sys_state.php\" script before executing a SQL query. A remote authenticated attacker can pass arbitrary SQL commands to the vulnerable script and execute them in application?s database. ， Successful exploitation of this vulnerability will allow an attacker to read , insert and modify arbitrary records in database and compromise the entire web application , but requires the attacker to be authenticated and to have \"monitor\" privileges. However , in combination with the CSRF vulnerability to which the application is also vulnerable , this vulnerability becomes exploitable by remote non-authenticated attacker. ， A simple exploit below will display MySQL server version. First , use the following HTTP request to execute the SQL query :  ， After that visit the page mentioned below , the result of MySQL 'version (  ) ' function will be displayed in the HTML code of the page :  ， 2 ) CSRF ( Cross-Site Request Forgery ) in ISPConfig : CVE-2015-4119 ， The vulnerability exists due to failure in the \"/admin/users_edit.php\" script to properly verify the origin of the HTTP request. A remote attacker can create a specially crafted web page with CSRF exploit , trick a logged-in administrator to visit this page and create a new user with administrative privileges. ， A simple CSRF exploit below creates an administrative account with username \"immuniweb\" and password \"immuniweb\" : ",
