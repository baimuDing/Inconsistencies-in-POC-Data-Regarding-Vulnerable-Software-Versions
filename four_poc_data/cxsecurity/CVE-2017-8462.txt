    "text": "vul_name : Microsoft Windows 'nt ! NtQueryVolumeInformationFile ( FileFsVolumeInformation ) ' Kernel Pool Memory Disclosure ， vul_cve : CVE-2017-8462 ， vul_poc : / *  ， We have discovered that the nt ! NtQueryVolumeInformationFile system call discloses portions of uninitialized pool memory to user-mode clients , due to output structure alignment holes. ， On our test Windows 10 32-bit workstation , an example layout of the output buffer is as follows :  ， - cut - ， 00000000 : 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 . ， 00000010 : 00 ff ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? . ， - cut - ， Where 00 denote bytes which are properly initialized , while ff indicate uninitialized values copied back to user-mode. The output data is returned in a FILE_FS_VOLUME_INFORMATION structure [ 1 ] . If we map the above shadow bytes to the structure definition , it turns out that the uninitialized byte corresponds to an alignment hole after the SupportsObjects field. ， The issue can be reproduced by running the attached proof-of-concept program on a system with the Special Pools mechanism enabled for ntoskrnl.exe. Then , it is clearly visible that bytes at the aforementioned offsets are equal to the markers inserted by Special Pools , and would otherwise contain leftover data that was previously stored in that memory region :  ， - cut - ， 00000000 : e7 5e f6 a6 e3 38 d1 01 25 1d a9 2e 00 00 00 00 .^.8.%. ， 00000010 : 01 [ 84 ] ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? . ， - cut - ， 00000000 : e7 5e f6 a6 e3 38 d1 01 25 1d a9 2e 00 00 00 00 .^.8.%. ， 00000010 : 01 [ ff ] ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? . ， - cut - ， Repeatedly triggering the vulnerability could allow local authenticated attackers to defeat certain exploit mitigations ( kernel ASLR ) or read other secrets stored in the kernel address space. ， This bug is subject to a 90 day disclosure deadline. After 90 days elapse or a patch has been made broadly available , the bug report will become visible to the public.",
