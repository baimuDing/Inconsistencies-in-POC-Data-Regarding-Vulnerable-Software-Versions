VULNERABILITY ， Multiple Vulnerabilities in Telaen <= 1.3.0 ， II. BACKGROUND ， Telaen is a webmail reader application supporting both IMAP and POP3 ， protocols. It can be installed without dependence of any PHP's extra ， modules or a separate database. It is Open source software published ， under GNU General Public License ( GPL ) . ， The last version of Telaen is 1.3.0 released on January 2012. ， III. DESCRIPTION ， Telaen 1.3.0 and lower versions contain a flaw that allows a remote ， redirection attack. This flaw exists because the application does not ， properly sanitise the file \"redir.php\". This allows an attacker to ， create a specially crafted URL , that if clicked , would redirect a ， victim from the intended legitimate web site to an arbitrary web site ， of the attacker's choice. ， Aditionaly , it has been detected a reflected XSS vulnerability in ， Telaen 1.3.0 and lower versions , that allows the execution of ， arbitrary HTML/JavaScript code to be executed in the context of the ， victim user's browser. The code injection is done through the ， parameter \"f_email\" in the page index.php. ， Due to the errors caused by the application Telaen 1.3.0 and lower ， versions , we can display the full webapp installation path. ， IV.
