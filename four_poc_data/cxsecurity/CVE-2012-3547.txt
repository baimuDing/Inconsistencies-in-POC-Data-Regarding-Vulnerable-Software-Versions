The vulnerability affects setups using TLS-based EAP ， methods ( including EAP-TLS , EAP-TTLS , and PEAP ) . ， FreeRADIUS defines a callback function cbtls_verify (  ) for certificate ， verification. The function has a local buf array with a size of 64 ， bytes. It copies the validity timestamp \"not after\" of a client ， certificate to the buf array :  ， asn_time = X509_get_notAfter ( client_cert )  ;  ， memcpy ( buf ,  ( char *  ) asn_time->data , asn_time->length )  ;  ， buf [ asn_time->length ] = '\\0' ;  ， The MAX_STRING_LEN constant is defined to be 254. If asn_time->length is ， greater than 64 bytes , but less than 254 bytes , buf overflows via the memcpy. ， Depending on the stack layout chosen by the compiler , the vulnerability allows ， to overflow the return address on the stack , which can be exploited for code ， execution. ， Solution ， The issue has been fixed in FreeRADIUS 2.2.0. Updates should be installed as ， soon as possible. ， When further information becomes available , this advisory will be ， updated. The most recent version of this advisory is available at :  ， Contact ， PRE-CERT can be reached under precert (  ) pre-secure de For PGP key ， information , refer to",
