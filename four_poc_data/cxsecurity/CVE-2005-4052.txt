INTRODUCTION ， e107 is the name of an open-source content management system ( cms ) that ， relies on php and sql. ， More Information are available at the official project web site :  ， II. DESCRIPTION ， Marc Ruef detected two flaws in rate.php. This file is responsible for ， the votes of the users to rate content ( e.g. the downloads ) . This voting ， is served by default with an option combobox in download.php for ， example. If the user has already rated a content , his user id is saved ， to the table e107_rate in the according rate data set. ， If an user is opening a download over download.php , the php script ， checks in the background if the user has already voted yet. If not , so ， the user id is not remarked in the rate data set , the option combobox is ， shown - If he has already voted , a place holder text string is used. ， This pre-detection tries to defend against multiple votes. ， If an user selected a value in the option combobox , the browser connects ， to rate.php and sends the rating data to this script as an HTTP GET ， query string. The first problem relies in the possibility of reply ， attacks. An attacker is able to call this rate.php url again and again ，  ( e.g. using the direct link and not relying the real user web frontend ， in download.php ) . Thus , a manipulation of the votes may be possible. ， Because in the default installation of the software the web frontend ， does not show who has already voted , a deeper investigation on the ， database would be nescessary. ， Furthermore the same php script is vulnerable to a simple ， redirection/forwarding attack. If an user is rating a content , he is ， opening the php script rate.php with some data in the HTTP GET query ， string variable. One of the data provided is the destination directory ， after successfull rating. An attacker may be able to create a malicous ， url and forward a victim to a potential dangerous content. ， It is very important to remark that in the default installation always ， the variable e_BASE is set before the forwarding url. In this string the ， base address of the web site is saved ( e.g. So an ， attacker is just able to define the directory names , file names and HTTP ， GET query string variables. A possible scenario for misuse may a social ， engineering attack or cross site scripting attempt. These always rely on ， the flaw in other parts of the web site. ， III. EXPLOITATION ， The following example url let us to vote for the content \"download\" with ， the id \"42\" every time we are accessing this url. The last integer ， defines the rate value ( between 1 and 10 ) . ， The following example url let us to vote for a content and afterwards we ， are forwarded to the script /etc/passwd. All the other data is still ， used for the rating procedure ( e.g. saving the new value in the rate ， table ) . ， IV. IMPACT ， Manipulation of ratings is not a real security problem for environments ， using e107. But is is a real threat for the reliability and integrity of ， all the ratings within e107. An attacker may be able to compromise a ， rating contest by voting multiple times for not liked or very liked ， content. ， The possibility of the forwarding attack may gain elevated privileges ， vulnerability on the target web server. Due the fact just the ， destination directory can be defined , no cross plattform attacks are ， possible. ， V. DETECTION ， Slight changes on the code of the affected php code may be able to ， detect and prevent the successfully attack. See VI for more technical ， details. ， VI. WORKAROUND ， The e107 team has provided a bugfix for the new release 0.7 in the CVS. ， To prevent multiple votes in earlier versions the following lines should ， be added to rate.php. These check once again , if the user has already ， voted or not. If this is a multiple rating attempt , a forwarding to the ， web site without adding the new data to the rate table is used instead. ， require_once ( e_HANDLER.\"rate_class.php\" )  ;  ，  $ rater = new rater ;  ， header ( \"location : \".e_BASE. $ qs [ 2 ]  )  ;  ， exit ;  ， } ， The workaround for a false redirection can be handled by comparing the ， data for the data base and the forwarding data ( e.g. if the table ， download is used then the forwarding should go to download.php anyway ) . ， If they are not the same , the forwarding should not be used. Due the ， fact in e107 prior 0.7 ratings for downloads are possible only , adding ， the following line in rate.php will override any other forwarding url. ，  $ qs [ 2 ] = e_BASE.\"download.php?view.\". $ qs [ 1 ]  ;  ， Please be aware , these code lines are just suggestions and not official ， patches. ， VII. VENDOR RESPONSE ， The e107 team was aware of the flaws for a long time. Due the fact the ， risk of the successfull exploitation was very low , no further ， countermeasures were implemented. But at this time at least the flaw of ， the multiple ratings has been eliminated. See VI for more details. ， VIII.
