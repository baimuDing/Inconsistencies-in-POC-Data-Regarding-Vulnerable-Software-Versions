If a laptop connects to an ad-hoc network it can later start ， beaconing the ad-hoc network's SSID as its own ad-hoc network without the ， laptop owner's knowledge. This can allow an attacker to attach to the laptop ， as a prelude to further attack. ， Details ， The following is a sample scenario: ， - Alice has a wireless access point at home with an SSID of \"linksys\", which ， she has successfully set up and connected to with her laptop. ， - Alice goes to the airport (or train station or coffee shop) and opens her ， laptop. ， - Bob, who is sitting next to Alice, has a laptop configured with an ad-hoc ， network advertising an SSID of \"linksys\". ， - Alice's laptop when started looks for the SSID of \"linksys\", and attachs to ， Bob's ad-hoc network. ， - The next time Alice boots up the laptop when the Ethernet cable is not ， attached and there is no \"linksys\" SSID in range, Alice starts advertising ， an ad-hoc network with an SSID of \"linksys\". ， This is basically a configuration error that spreads virus-like from laptop to ， laptop. In field tests, numerous ad-hoc SSIDs such as \"linksys\", \"dlink\", ， \"tmobile\", \"hpsetup\", and others have been documented. ， The issue is compounded with a few additional caveats. Laptops with built-in ， wireless connectivity are usually left with the wireless active. Additionally, ， by default most wireless connections use DHCP to acquire an IP address. If ， the DHCP request fails, Microsoft has implemented RFC 3927 [1] to provide an IP ， address via APIPA (Automated Private IP Address) [2] in the 169.254.0.0/16 ， range [3]. This is known as a Link-Local address, and by default Link-Local is ， turned on on all Windows platforms on all interfaces, including wireless ， interfaces. Details of Microsoft's Link-Local implementation is in RFC 3927, ， appendix A.4 (Microsoft is a co-author of RFC 3927). ， Essentially this assigns the advertising ad-hoc network an IP address. On ， Windows 2000 and Windows XP SP0 and SP1, this all happens in the background ， without the user's knowledge - on Windows XP SP2, the user is notified it has ， \"attached\" to an ad-hoc network, when in fact it has simply started ， advertising the ad-hoc network and the Link-Local address has been assigned. An ， attacker can attach to the ad-hoc SSID and either manually assign an IP address ， in the 169.254 class B or simply DHCP and await a time-out that assigns the ， attacker's laptop an IP address via a Link-Local configuration. After passively ， sniffing and awaiting the usual NetBIOS traffic and/or by running a ping sweep, ， the victim's IP address can be discovered. The attacker can then perform the ， various probes and attacks to gain access to the system. ， If the attacker is impatient in waiting for determining the IP address of the ， victim computer, the attacker can attach to the advertising SSID and offer up ， a DHCP server. Windows systems running Link-Local addresses periodically probe ， switch to the new address supplied by the DHCP as opposed to continue using the ， APIPA number. By tracking what IP addresses are being served by the DHCP ， server, the attacker can spend more time on an attack and less time solving the ， connectivity issue. ， There is a warning about using Link-Local with wireless LANs due to the lack of ， physical security in RFC 3927 section 5 paragraph 3, but unfortunately ， Microsoft failed to properly heed this warning in spite of co-authoring the ， RFC. ， Tested configurations ， Field tests were conducted and the following systems were either positively ， identified (sometimes via \"shoulder surfing\") or approximated based upon ， passive fingerprinting of network traffic: ， Windows 2000 SP 2 ， Windows 2000 SP 3 ， Windows 2000 SP 4 ， Windows XP Home Edition Gold ， Windows XP Professional Gold ， Windows XP Professional SP 1 ， Windows XP Professional SP 2 ， Windows 2003 (unknown patch level) ， Lab tests were conducted with 2 laptops with the following configuration: ， Windows XP Professional Gold ， Windows XP Professional SP 2 ， Vendor Response ， Microsoft was contacted on October 13, 2005.
