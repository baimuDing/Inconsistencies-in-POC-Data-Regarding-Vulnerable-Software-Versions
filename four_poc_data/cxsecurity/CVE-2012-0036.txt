    "text": "vul_name : curl 7.2x data injection attacks via a crafted URL ， vul_cve : CVE-2012-0036 ， vul_poc : libcurl is vulnerable to a data injection attack for certain protocols ， through control characters embedded or percent-encoded in URLs. ， When parsing URLs , libcurl's parser is very laxed and liberal and only ， parses as little as possible and lets as much as possible through as long as ， it can figure out what to do. ， In the specific process when libcurl extracts the file path part from a ， given URL , it didn't always verify the data or escape control characters ， properly before it passed the file path on to the protocol-specific code ， that then would use it for its protocol business. ， This passing through of control characters could be exploited by someone who ， would be able to pass in a handicrafted URL to libcurl. Lots of libcurl ， using applications let users enter URLs in one form or another and not all ， of these check the input carefully to prevent malicious ones. ， A malicious user might pass in %0d%0a to get treated as CR LF by libcurl ,  ， and by using this fact a user can trick for example a POP3 client to delete ， a message instead of getting it or trick an SMTP server to send an ， unintended message. ， This vulnerability can be used to fool libcurl with the following protocols :  ， IMAP , POP3 and SMTP. ， There is no known exploit for this problem. ， This flaw only affects curl versions 7.20.0 up to and including 7.23.1 It is ， corrected in 7.24.0 by scanning for a range of \"bad codes\" in the path part of ， URLs so that they are rejected before any protocol code even can consider using ， them. ， This flaw has been assigned the name CVE-2012-0036. ，  [ 1 ]  ， Statement :  ， Not vulnerable. This issue did not affect the versions of curl as shipped with ， Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 , 5 or 6.",
