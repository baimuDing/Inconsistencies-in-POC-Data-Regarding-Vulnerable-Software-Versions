This makes it possible for authenticated attackers with contributor-level and above permissions to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. ， Description : Slimstat Analytics <= 5.0.9 Authenticated ( Contributor+ ) Blind SQL Injection via Shortcode ， Affected Plugin : Slimstat Analytics ， Plugin Slug : wp-slimstat ， Affected Versions : <= 5.0.9 ， CVE ID : CVE-2023-4598 ， CVSS Score : 8.8 ( High )  ， CVSS Vector : CVSS : 3.1/AV : N/AC : L/PR : L/UI : N/S : U/C : H/I : H/A : H ， Researcher/s : Lana Codes ， Fully Patched Version : 5.0.10 ， The Slimstat Analytics plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to SQL Injection via the plugins shortcode in versions up to , and including , 5.0.9 due to insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers with contributor-level and above permissions to append additional SQL queries into already existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive information from the database. ， Technical Analysis ， Slimstat Analytics is a WordPress website traffic analytics plugin that offers several features for analyzing and monitoring traffic. It provides a shortcode (  [ slimstat ]  ) that displays various types of statistics when added to a WordPress page or post. ， Unfortunately , insecure implementation of the plugins shortcode functionality allows for the injection of arbitrary web scripts into these pages. Examining the code reveals that the shortcode has several types based on the f parameter. In vulnerable versions , the top-all type does not adequately sanitize the user-supplied w attribute , and then fails to escape the class output derived from the w parameter when it displays the statistics. This makes it possible to inject attribute-based Cross-Site Scripting payloads via the w attribute. ，  [ View this code snippet on the blog. ] ",
