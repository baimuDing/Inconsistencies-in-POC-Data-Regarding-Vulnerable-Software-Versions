Later in 2000 , with the modification of the US export laws , vendors were able to include 128-bit ciphers in their products and were able to distribute these all over the world. ， The only problem is that 'export-grade' ; cryptography support was never removed and now three decades later , FREAK attack make it significantly easier for hackers to decode the website's private key and decrypt passwords , login cookies , and other sensitive information from HTTPS connections. ， HOW FREAK ATTACK WORKS ? ， Assistant Research Professor Matthew Green of Johns Hopkins University's Information Security Institute in Maryland summarizes the FREAK vulnerability in a blog post detailing how a hacker could perform MitM attack :  ， In the client's Hello message , it asks for a standard 'RSA' ciphersuite. ， The MITM attacker changes this message to ask for 'export RSA'. ， The server responds with a 512-bit export RSA key , signed with its long-term key. ， The client accepts this weak key due to the OpenSSL/Secure Transport bug. ， The attacker factors the RSA modulus to recover the corresponding RSA decryption key. ， When the client encrypts the 'pre-master secret' to the server , the attacker can now decrypt it to recover the TLS 'master secret'. ， From here on out , the attacker sees plain text and can inject anything it wants. ， A scan of more than 14 million websites that support the SSL/TLS protocols found that more than 36% of them were vulnerable to the decryption attacks that support RSA export cipher suites ( e.g. , TLS_RSA_EXPORT_WITH_DES40_CBC_SHA ) . ， Cracking a 512-bit key back in the '90s would have required access to supercomputers of that time , but today , it can be done in seven hours and cost nearly $ 100 per website only. ， It is possible to carry out FREAK attack when a user running a vulnerable device \" currently includes Android smartphones , iPhones and Macs running Apple's OS X operating system \" connects to a vulnerable HTTPS-protected website. At the moment , Windows and Linux end-user devices were not believed to be affected. ， 'FREAK' SIMILAR TO 'POODLE' ， FREAK vulnerability is similar to last year'sPOODLE flaw or Padding Oracle On Downgraded Legacy Encryption , which allowed hackers to downgrade the entire SSL/TLS Internet-communication security suite to the weakest possible version. FREAK affects only those SSL/TLS implementations that accept export versions of protocols that use the RSA encryption algorithm",
