Builds using the default crypto ， backends are not affected. ， While this new ECDSA vulnerability is very similar to the RSA signature ， vulnerability CVE-2012-2388, it is not directly related. ， A connection definition using ECDSA authentication is required to ， exploit this vulnerability. Given that, an attacker presenting a forged ， signature and/or certificate can authenticate as any legitimate user. ， Injecting code is not possible by such an attack. ， The patch at [1] fixes the vulnerability and should apply to all ， affected versions. strongSwan 5.0.4 includes the fix and other minor ， changes and can be downloaded from [2]. ， This vulnerability was discovered by Kevin Wojtysiak, an independent ， Security Consultant. We want to express our thanks to Kevin for ， notifying us in advance about this critical security issue. ， The above information can also be found in our blog entry at [3]. ， Our apologies for having such a serious vulnerability in the strongSwan ， codebase. ， Kind Regards, ， Tobias ， [1] ， [2] ， [3]"
