Doing a quick grep of the 1.0.2 source code finds no ， occurace of \"viewpro\" at all. The line above also happens to be exactly ， the same as your DevBB disclosure , suggesting this may be a bad cut/paste? ， Additionally , in the subsequent posting you refer to additional scripts ， being affected :  ， /portfolio.php?cat_id= [ XSS ]  ， /portfolio_photo_popup.php?id= [ XSS ]  ， Secunia apparently wasn't able to validate all of the XSS but instead ， found one SQL injection issue :  ， Can you confirm or clarify any of the above?",
