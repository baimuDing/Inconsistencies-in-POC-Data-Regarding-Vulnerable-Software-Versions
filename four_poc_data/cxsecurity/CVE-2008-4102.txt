However ， attackers are usually bouncing over much faster hosts. ， In response to our report Joomla 1.5.7 was released (without sharing ， the patch with us prior the release) which replaces the very weak PRNG ， seeding with a new seed that is about 2^32 in strength. While this ， stops the simple brute forcing attack Joomla's password reset token ， is still vulnerable to mt_rand() leak attacks and because Joomla still ， seeds the PRNG with mt_srand() it is a potential threat to other PHP ， applications or plugins using mt_rand() on the same server. ， Details: ， The problems arising from using mt_(s)rand for cryptographic secrets ， and possible attacks against PHP's PRNG and PHP applications using it ， are explained by the blog post \"mt_(s)rand and not so random numbers\" ， which is available here:"
