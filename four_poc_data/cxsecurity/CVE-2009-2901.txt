This behaviour is controlled by the autoDeploy attribute ， of a host which defaults to true. After a failed undeploy , the remaining ， files will be deployed as a result of the autodeployment process. ， Depending on circumstances , files normally protected by one or more ， security constraints may be deployed without those security constraints ,  ， making them accessible without authentication. ， Mitigation :  ， 6.0.x users should upgrade to 6.0.24 or apply this patch :  ， 5.5.x users should upgrade to 5.5.29 when released or apply this patch :  ， Note : the patches also address CVE-2009-2693 and CVE-2009-2902. ， Alternatively , users of all Tomcat versions may mitigate this issue by ， manually ensuring that an undeploy removes all files. If one or more ， files cannot be deleted , it may be necessary to stop Tomcat before the ， files can be deleted. ， Credit :  ， This issue was discovered by the Apache Tomcat security team ，  [ 1 ]  ， Mark Thomas",
