The intent of ， this feature is to limit XSLT/XML processing behaviours to \"make the XSLT ， processor behave in a secure fashion\". ， It has been discovered that the secure processing features suffers from several ， limitations that undermine its purpose. The enabling of the secure processing ， feature in fact still allows the following processing to take place :  ，  * Java properties , bound to XSLT 1.0 system-property (  )  , are accessible. ，  * output properties that allow to load arbitrary classes or resources ， are allowed ( XALANJ-2435 ) . ，  * arbitrary code can be executed if the Bean Scripting Framework ( BSF )  ， is in the classpath , as it allows to spawn available JARs with secure ， processing disabled , effectively bypassing the intended protection. ， Affected version :  ， Xalan-Java >= 2.7.0 ， Fixed version :  ， Xalan-Java >= r1581058 ( see references )  ， Credit : vulnerability report received from Nicolas Gregoire ， <nicolas.gregoire AT agarri.fr>. ， CVE : CVE-2014-0107",
