    "text": "vul_name : Watchguard Firebox / XTM XE Injection ， vul_cve : CVE-2017-8055 ， vul_poc : Watchguardas Firebox and XTM are a series of enterprise grade network ， security appliances providing advanced security services like next ， generation firewall , intrusion prevention , malware detection and ， blockage and others. Two vulnerabilities were discovered affecting the ， XML-RPC interface of the Web UI used to manage Fireware , the operating ， system running on Watchguard Firebox and XTM appliances. To exploit ， any of the flaws discovered , no authentication on the Web UI is ， needed. ， XML-RPC External Entity Expansion DoS ， Credit ， David Fernandez of Sidertia Solutions ， Versions Affected ， Fireware v11.9 version was found to be vulnerable and vendor confirmed ， v11.12 Update 1 ( latest when we reported to vendor ) was vulnerable as ， well. ， CVE ， As far as we know , no CVE has been requested for this vulnerability. ， Vendor assigned internal id 92867 to vulnerability and will release a ， knowledge Base article following this advisory. ， Vendor Fix ， Vendor fixed the vulnerability in their v11.12.2 release. ， Vulnerability Type ， Denial of service. ， Description ， While attempting to abuse the XML parser of the interface by mean of ， External Entity Expansion ( XE ) attacks , we discovered that after ， repetitive attempts the XML-RPC agent crashes causing a severe ， disruption in the functionality and performance of the device. ， Impact ， On Fireware version v11.9 , after a discrete number of injection ， attempts , the XML-RPC agent ( wgagent ) crashes and is not able to ， recover , causing a lockout in the Web UI which will be unavailable for ， ten minutes , thus making impossible to manage the firewall. Besides ， that , it causes either service interrupt or a serious degradation in ， performance in connections traversing the firewall ( for example , RDP ， clients were unable to connect or did it in slow connection mode ) . On ， Fireware version v11.12 Update 1 , the agent recovers correctly after ， each crash , although by continuously executing the XE attacks the ， negative effects on the device are the same than the ones observed in ， v11.9. ， Proof of concept ， Below is an example of one of the requests that , after several ， attempts , causes a crash in the XML-RPC agent :  ， POST /agent/login HTTP/1.1 ， Host : fireware-host : 4100 ， Connection : close ， Cache-Control : max-age=0 ， Upgrade-Insecure-Requests : 1 ， User-Agent : Mozilla/5.0 ( Windows NT 6.3 ; WOW64 ) AppleWebKit/537.36 ，  ( KHTML , like Gecko ) Chrome/53.0.2785.116 Safari/537.36",
