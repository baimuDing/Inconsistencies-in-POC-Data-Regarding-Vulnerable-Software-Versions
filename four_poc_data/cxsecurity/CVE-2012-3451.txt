The web service ， client ， can send the SOAP Action String as a header with the request as a way of ， letting the web service know what operation is required. ， In some cases, CXF uses the received SOAP Action to select the correct ， operation to invoke, and does not check to see that the message body is ， correct. This can be exploitable to execute a SOAP Action spoofing attack, ， where an adversary can execute another operation in the web service by ， sending ， the corresponding SOAP Action. This attack only works if the different ， operation takes the same parameter types, and hence has somewhat limited ， applicability. ， This attack also only applies for web services that use unique SOAPActions ， per ， service operation which is not the default in CXF. Also note that WS-Policy ， validation is done against the operation being invoked and thus the incoming ， message must meet those policy requirements as well, also limiting ， applicability. ， This has been fixed in revision: ， All released versions of CXF are affected. ， Migration: ， Users of CXF prior to 2.4.x should upgrade to either 2.4.9, 2.5.5, or 2.6.2. ， CXF 2.4.x users should upgrade to 2.4.9 as soon as possible. ， CXF 2.5.x users should upgrade to 2.5.5 as soon as possible. ， CXF 2.6.x users should upgrade to 2.6.2 as soon as possible. ， Colm O hEigeartaigh ， Talend Community Coder"
