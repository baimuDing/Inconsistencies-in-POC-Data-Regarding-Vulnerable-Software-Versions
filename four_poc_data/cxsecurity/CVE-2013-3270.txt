Commands in these files could be executed in a root-level context. A less privileged administrator could exploit this vulnerability to run arbitrary commands as the root user. ， Note : The nasadmin user account on the VNX or Celerra Control Station is designed to be the most privileged ( and hence most trusted ) administrator for the system. This user has system-wide management capabilities for the box and is authorized to make extensive changes to the storage system. Use of the nasadmin user account should be viewed and treated appropriately. Additional information about the nasadmin user , group , and role on the VNX and Celerra Control Station can be found in EMC Knowledge Base article emc325029.",
