This CMS is scalable for small businesses to large corporations. ， TL ; DR :  ， XSS in admin console , weak CSRF protection and a possible PHP object insertion via unserialize. ， These vulnerabilities were considered unimportant by the CMS Made Simple developers. Their reasoning was that they had to be exploited by a logged in administrator user who is a trusted user anyway. When I explained to them that with XSS all you need to do is send a malicious link to the administrator , they responded back saying that they are confident in their CSRF protection. I then sent them an analysis of their CSRF protection ( at the bottom of this advisory )  , which I found to be quite weak. Finally they commited to implement a half-assed mitigation for the CSRF token weakness but said they will not fix the other issues.",
