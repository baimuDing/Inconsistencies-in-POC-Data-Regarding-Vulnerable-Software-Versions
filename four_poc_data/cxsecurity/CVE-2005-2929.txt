    "text": "vul_name : Multiple Vendor Lynx Command Injection Vulnerability ， vul_cve : CVE-2005-2929 ， vul_poc : iDefense Security Advisory 11.11.05 :  ， I. BACKGROUND ， Lynx is a fully-featured WWW client for users running cursor- ， addressable , character-cell display devices such as vt100 terminals and ， terminal emulators. Lynx support a number of protocols including HTTP ,  ， HTTPS , gopher , FTP , WAIS , NNTP , finger or cso/ph/qi servers , and ， services accessible via logons to telnet , tn3270 or rlogin accounts. ， II. DESCRIPTION ， Remote exploitation of a command injection vulnerability in various ， vendors' implementations of Lynx could allow attackers to execute ， arbitrary commands with the privileges of the underlying user. ， The problem specifically exists within the feature to execute local ， cgi-bin programs via the \"lynxcgi : \" URI handler. The handler is ， generally intended to be restricted to a specific directory or ， program ( s ) . However , due to a configuration error on multiple platforms ,  ， the default settings allow for arbitrary websites to specify commands to ， run as the user running Lynx. ， III. ANALYSIS ， Successful exploitation of the described vulnerability allows remote ， attackers to execute arbitrary commands with the privileges of the ， underlying user. Exploitation requires that an attacker convince a ， target user to follow a malicious link from within a vulnerable version ， of Lynx. The \"lynxexec\" and \"lynxprog\" URI handlers can also be used to ， trigger the issue. However , they are rarely compiled into the Lynx ， binary. ， IV. DETECTION ， iDEFENSE has confirmed the existence of this vulnerability in the latest ， stable release of Lynx , version 2.8.5. It is suspected that earlier ， versions are also affected. The following vendors include susceptible ， Lynx packages within their respective distributions :  ，  * Red Hat Inc. ，  * Gentoo Foundation Inc. ，  * Mandriva SA ， Other vendors are suspected as also being vulnerable. The following ， vendors include Lynx packages that are not susceptible to exploitation ， as the \"lynxcgi\" feature is not compiled into Lynx by default :  ，  * The FreeBSD Project ，  * OpenBSD ， V. WORKAROUND ， Disable \"lynxcgi\" links by specifying the following directive in ， lynx.cfg :  ， TRUSTED_LYNXCGI : none ， VI. VENDOR RESPONSE ， Development version 2.8.6dev.15 has been released to address this issue ， and is available from the following URLs :  ， Alternately , an incremental patch is available at :  ， VII. CVE INFORMATION ， The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures ( CVE ) project has assigned the ， name CVE-2005-2929 to this issue. This is a candidate for inclusion in ， the CVE list ( which standardizes names for ， security problems.",
