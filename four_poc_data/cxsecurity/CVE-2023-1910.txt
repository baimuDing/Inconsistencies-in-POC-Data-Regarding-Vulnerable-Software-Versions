    "text": "vul_name : WordPress Getwid Gutenberg Blocks 1.8.3 Improper Authorization / SSRF ， vul_cve : CVE-2023-1895 , CVE-2023-1910 ， vul_poc : On April 6 , 2023 , the Wordfence Threat Intelligence team initiated the responsible disclosure process for two vulnerabilities in Getwid Gutenberg Blocks , a plugin installed on over 50 , 000 WordPress sites. The plugins developers responded immediately , and we sent over the full disclosure the same day. A patched version of the plugin , 1.8.4 , was released on April 13 , 2023. ， The most serious vulnerability had a high severity because it allows authenticated users to perform Server Side Request Forgery ( SSRF )  , which can result in full access to the hosted instance on some cloud configurations. Additionally , it may allow further penetration into internal networks in some enterprise configurations. The other vulnerability is much lower in severity and allows authenticated users to clear and update the sites template cache. ， Wordfence Premium , Wordfence Care , and Wordfence Response customers received a firewall rule protecting against the Server Side Request Forgery ( SSRF ) on April 6 , 2023. Wordfence Free users received the same protection on May 6 , 2023. ， READ THIS POST ON THE BLOG ， Vulnerability Summary from Wordfence Intelligence ， Description : Getwid Gutenberg Blocks <= 1.8.3 - Authenticated ( Subscriber+ ) Server Side Request Forgery ， Affected Plugin : Getwid Gutenberg Blocks ， Plugin Slug : getwid ， Affected Versions : <= 1.8.3 ， CVE ID : CVE-2023-1895 ， CVSS Score : 8.8 ( High )  ， CVSS Vector : CVSS : 3.1/AV : N/AC : L/PR : L/UI : N/S : C/C : H/I : L/A : N ， Researcher/s : Ramuel Gall ， Fully Patched Version : 1.8.4 ， The Getwid Gutenberg Blocks plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Server Side Request Forgery via the get_remote_content REST API endpoint in versions up to , and including , 1.8.3. This can allow authenticated attackers with subscriber-level permissions or above to make web requests to arbitrary locations originating from the web application and can be used to query and modify information from internal services. ， Description : Getwid Gutenberg Blocks <= 1.8.3 - Improper Authorization via get_remote_templates REST endpoint ， Affected Plugin : Getwid Gutenberg Blocks ， Plugin Slug : getwid ， Affected Versions : <= 1.8.3 ， CVE ID : CVE-2023-1910 ， CVSS Score : 4.3 ( Medium )  ， CVSS Vector : CVSS : 3.1/AV : N/AC : L/PR : L/UI : N/S : U/C : N/I : L/A : N ， Researcher/s : Ramuel Gall ， Fully Patched Version : 1.8.4 ， The Getwid Gutenberg Blocks plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data due to an insufficient capability check on the get_remote_templates function in versions up to , and including , 1.8.3. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers with subscriber-level permissions or above to flush the remote template cache. Cached template information can also be accessed via this endpoint but these are not considered sensitive as they are publicly accessible from the developer's site. ， Technical Analysis ， Getwid Gutenberg Blocks is a plugin offering a library of pre-generated blocks which it makes available to plugin users and retrieves remotely from the developers server. Unfortunately , this remote retrieval functionality , which utilized the REST API , only required an authenticated user in vulnerable versions , meaning that even subscriber-level users could make use of it. ， While the rest routes for both vulnerabilities used a capability check in the permissions_check function , the capability checked was 'read' , which all users , even subscribers , are assigned. ， register-rest functionality ， Pictured : The REST API Endpoints and the permissions_check function ， On its own this was not a significant issue , but the get_remote_content function also failed to validate the URL passed in , meaning it could be used to retrieve information from any location via the server. ， get_remote_content function ， Pictured : The get_remote_content function ， Only GET requests can be performed and the response data will only be rendered if it is JSON-formatted. However , sites hosted on Amazon AWS EC2 instances all have an endpoint which can be accessed internally and returns JSON-formatted credentials that can be used to access the instance. ， SSRF response ， Pictured : EC2 Credentials on a test box retrieved using this exploit. Click through to the blog post and then click on the image to see it at full size ， Sites running on AWS EC2 instances using IMDS ( Instance Metadata Service ) version 1 are vulnerable to this attack , while IMDSv2 offers preventative measures that prevent successful exploitation. ， The second issue was significantly less severe and made use of the minimal capability check on the get_remote_templates function. While this would likely have minimal impact on a site , it still compromises the sites integrity to some extent.",
