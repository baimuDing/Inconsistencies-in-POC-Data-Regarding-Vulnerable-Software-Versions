    "text": "vul_name : linuxkernel 2.6.33 rc4 dns_resolver upcall security issue ， vul_cve : CVE-2010-2524 ， vul_poc :  ， CIFS has the ability to chase MS-DFS referrals. In order to do this it ， has to be able to resolve hostnames into IP addresses. For this , it uses ， the keys API to upcall to the cifs.upcall userspace helper. It then ， resolves the name and hands the address back to the kernel. ， The dns_resolver upcall currently used by CIFS is susceptible to cache ， stuffing. It's possible for a malicious user to stuff the keyring with ， the results of a lookup , and then trick the server into mounting a ， server of his choosing. ， I have assigned this with CVE-2010-2524. To be susceptible to this , you ， need CONFIG_CIFS_DFS_UPCALL enabled. Interesting bug. ， Upstream commit : ",
