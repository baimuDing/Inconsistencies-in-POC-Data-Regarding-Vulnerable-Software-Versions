The same permissions are set for this archive file so all authenticated users can access it. ， Taking all of this into account we can create an attack scenario :  ， 1. If tvDebug.zip file exists then delete it ， 2. Create hardlink ( using CreateHardlink.exe ) named tvDebug.zip which points to other file that we would like to have permissions to ( this file must not be taken by other process when Check Point service tries to use it )  ， 3. Fill tvDebug.log log file above the limit. For ZoneAlarm it is 50Mb , for VPN it is 20Mb. It can be done by using software as normal user. ， 4. Restart system as service needs to be restarted to make an archive. ， 5. Now your file has permissions changed and you have all access to it. ， 6. If we pointed to \"C : \\Program Files ( x86 ) \\CheckPoint\\Endpoint Connect\\LogonISReg.dll\" in step 2 then we can replace this DLL with custom one. ， 7. Click \"VPN Options\" in Client GUI and then close this windows. Closing \"VPN Options\" window forces LogonISReg.dll to be loaded with SYSTEM privileges.",
