This can be exploited to execute arbitrary HTML and script code ， in a logged in administrator's browser session in context of an ， affected site. ， 2) Input passed to multiple parameters when importing the ， ip-to-country.csv file is not properly sanitised before being used in a ， SQL query. This can be exploited to manipulate SQL queries by injecting ， arbitrary SQL code when an administrator is tricked into importing a ， malicious ip-to-country.csv file. ， 3) Input passed via the \"HTTP Referer\", the \"HTTP User Agent\", and the ， \"HTTP Accept Language\" Header bsqtemplateinc.php is not properly ， sanitised before being used in SQL queries. This can be exploited to ， manipulate SQL queries by injecting arbitrary SQL code. ， Successful exploitation requires that \"magic_quotes_gpc\" is disabled. ， 4) Input passed to the \"baseDir\" parameter in ， components/com_bsq_sitestats/external/rssfeeds.php is not properly ， verified before being used to include files. This can be exploited to ， execute arbitrary PHP code by including files from local or external ， resources. ， Successful exploitation requires that \"register_globals\" is enabled. ， The vulnerabilities have been confirmed in version 1.8.0. Other ， versions may also be affected. ， 5) Solution ， The vulnerabilities have been fixed in version 2.2.1. ， 6) Time Table ， 14/09/2006 - Vendor notified. ， 14/09/2006 - Vendor response. ， 17/09/2006 - Vendor releases fixed version 2.2.1. ， 29/09/2006 - Public disclosure. ， 7) Credits ， Discovered by Sven Krewitt, Secunia Research. ， 8) ， None assigned. ， 9) About Secunia ， Secunia offers vulnerability management solutions to corporate ， customers with verified and reliable vulnerability intelligence ， relevant to their specific system configuration: ， Secunia also provides a publicly accessible and comprehensive advisory ， database as a service to the security community and private ， individuals, who are interested in or concerned about IT-security. ， Secunia believes that it is important to support the community and to ， do active vulnerability research in order to aid improving the ， security and reliability of software in general: ， Secunia regularly hires new skilled team members.
