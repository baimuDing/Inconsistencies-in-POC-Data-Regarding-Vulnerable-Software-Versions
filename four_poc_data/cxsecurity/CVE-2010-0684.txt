BACKGROUND ， Apache ActiveMQ is the most popular and powerful open source ， messaging and Integration Patterns provider. ， II. DESCRIPTION ， Remote unauthenticated exploitation of an input validation ， vulnerability in Apache Software Foundation's ActiveMQ server could ， allow an attacker to perform a ， stored or persistent cross-site scripting ( XSS ) attack. The code ， responsible for parsing HTTP requests is vulnerable to an XSS ， vulnerability. When parsing the JMSDestination parameter from a GET ， request to /createDestination.action page , the value of this variable ， is directly inserted into the HTML code that can be accessed by using ， URLs such as /queues.jsp. This allows an attacker to run arbitrary ， JavaScript in the context of the affected domain of the ActiveMQ ， administration console. ， III. ANALYSIS ， Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to ， conduct an XSS attack on a user. This could allow an attacker to steal ， cookies , inject content into pages , or submit requests using the ， user's credentials. To exploit this vulnerability , an attacker must ， send malicious request to the vulnerable Active MQ server such as the ， following request :  ， OAD ]  ， Once this request is sent , anyone accessing the ActiveMQ queues would ， have the XSS payload executed in the context of the browser session ， being used to browse using a URL such as :  ， IV. DETECTION ， The author and Apache Software Foundation's ActiveMQ group has ， confirmed this vulnerability. ， V. WORKAROUND ， The author is currently unaware of any workaround for this issue but ， fix has been released by the vendor. ， VI. VENDOR RESPONSE ， The Apache Software Foundation ActiveMQ team has addressed this ， vulnerability by releasing version 5.3.1 of ActiveMQ. ， More information can be found at the following URL. ， VII. CVE INFORMATION ， The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures ( CVE ) project has assigned ， the name CVE-2010-0684 to this issue. This is a candidate for ， inclusion in the CVE list ( which standardizes ， names for security problems.",
