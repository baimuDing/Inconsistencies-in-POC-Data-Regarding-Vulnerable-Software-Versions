Egidy <gerd.von.egidy (at) intra2net (dot) com [email concealed]> of Intra2net AG affecting ， all Openswan and all Strongswan releases. ， A malicious (or expired ISAKMP) R_U_THERE or R_U_THERE_ACK Dead Peer ， Detection packet can cause the pluto IKE daemon to crash and restart. No ， authentication or encryption is required to trigger this bug. One spoofed ， UDP packet can cause the pluto IKE daemon to restart and be unresponsive ， A patch was created by Paul Wouters <paul (at) xelerance (dot) com [email concealed]> for Openswan and ， Strongswan. ， This bug affects the following software releases: ， Current branches: ， Openswan-2.6.20 and earlier ， Strongswan-4.2.13 and earlier ， Maintenance mode branches: ， Openswan-2.4.13 and earlier ， Strongswan-2.8.8 and earlier ， End of Life branches: ， Superfreeswan-1.9x ， Openswan-1.x ， Openswan-2.0.x - 2.3.1 ， Openswan-2.5.x ， Everyone is strongly encouraged to upgrade to these minimum versions: ， openswan-2.6.21 ， strongswan-4.2.14 ， openswan-2.4.14 ， strongswan-2.8.9 ， If you cannot upgrade to a new version, please apply the appropriate ， patch as listed at ， Dead Peer Detection is an IPsec IKE Notification message. It uses ， an ICOOKIE/RCOOKIE mechanism to match an incoming packet to a know ， Security Association (ISAKMP). Unlike most Notification messages, DPD ， notifications have no phase2 state association. Incorrect handling of ， this exception can cause a NULL pointer dereference on a non-existing ， state object 'st'. This bug is triggered in the case where one end has ， expired an ISAKMP state, but the other end still uses the old state ， to send a DPD Notification. ， Since this state-lookup is performed before any encryption or ， decryption takes place, as we need to find the proper ISAKMP to locate ， the cryptogrpahic key material used for decryption, this bug can be ， triggered without going through a phase1 (ISAKMP) negotiation. ， When such a packet is received, the pluto daemon crashes and restarts."
