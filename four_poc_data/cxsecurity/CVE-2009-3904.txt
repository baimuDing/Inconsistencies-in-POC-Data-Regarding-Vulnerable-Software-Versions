Background ， From Wikipedia : CubeCart is a free-to-use eCommerce software solution ,  ， designed to allow individuals and businesses sell tangible and digital ， goods on line. ， CubeCart is not Open Source software , although full source code is ， available at no cost , and the custom licensing model allows for ， customisation of the code. ， . ， CubeCart has developed a large fanbase , due in part , to the relative ， ease of creating modifications and enhancements. ， In the September/October 2007 issue of Practical eCommerce magazine ,  ， CubeCart was placed at # 1 in their list of '100 Most Notable Shopping ， Carts'. ， II. Description ， While auditing the source code of CubeCart version v4.3.4 , I've found a ， critical vulnerability in this application. ， Basically , session managament for administrative users is flawed. It's ， easy to bypass it without providing any credentials. ， An attacker can later perform any actions the administrator can , such as ， dumping the database , install modules ( PHP code execution ) and so on. ， CubeCart is using a MySQL table named CubeCart_admin_users for storing ， information about administrative users. ， When an administrator logs in , the applications stores his session ID ,  ， browser ( user agent ) and IP address in the sessId , browser and sessIP ， fields. ， > SELECT adminId , username , sessId , browser , sessIp FROM ， CubeCart_admin_users C ;  ， 1 , 'admin' , '9a58f70e7ded1bcb568b02815a1c4a56' , 'Mozilla/5.0 ( Windows ;  ， U ; Windows NT 5.1 ; en-US ) AppleWebKit/532.0 ( KHTML , like Gecko )  ， Chrome/3.0.195.27 Safari/532.0' , '192.168.0.26' ， When the adminstrator logs out , these values are cleared. So sessId and ， the others fields become empty ( as in an empty string ) . ， > SELECT adminId , username , sessId , browser , sessIp FROM ， CubeCart_admin_users C ;  ， 1 , 'admin' , ' , ' , '",
