A malicious user can send spoofed registration messages to the server to which a UNIStim IP phone is connected. This can force the legitimate IP phone into a situation where it must re-register ， with the server to maintain service. A continuous stream of these messages prevents the IP phone from properly registering. ， Nortel has noted this as: ， Title: DoS Potential Vulnerability - UNIStim IP Phone Forced to Re-register ， Number: 2007008385 ， Vulnerable: ， Nortel IP Phone 1140E ， IP Softphone 2050 ， and others. ， See associated products on the Nortel advisory. ， Vulnerability Management: ， June 2007: Vulnerability found ， June 2007: Nortel Security notified ， October 2007: Nortel Advisory & Patches available ， October 2007: Compass Security Information ， Remediation: ， Follow the recommended actions for the affected systems, as identified in the Nortel Advisory."
