No fix available. ， Overview: ， vtiger [1] is an open source customer relationship management system (CRM) ， which is maintained by an indian company with the same name. It has been ， forked off the SugarCRM project [2] in an earlier stage, thus a number of ， issues reported by GulfTech Security in [3] are also present in vtiger. An ， additional layer of insecurity has obviously been introduced by the devel- ， opers, enabling malicious users to log in to the CRM without any creden- ， tials whatsoever and execute remote code. ， Details: ， 1) XSS issues-a-plenty ， As James Bercegay reported, there is an abundance of XSS problems all ， over the CRM, with only a few examples being the following: ， - a malicious local user could create a contact, lead, account, poten- ， tial or other data set that includes script code in any field. Typi- ， cal fields would be first or last name, but nearly every other field ， is possible, too. Then, the malicious user could send the link to ， that contact to the administrator - and have the script code do what- ， ever DOM operation is necessary to elevate privileges. ， - Even easier and without any inside knowledge needed: ， /index.php?action=DetailView&module=Leads&record=%3Cscript%3Ealert ， ('document.cookie')%3C/script%3E (as reported by James). ， - Since the variable $_SERVER['PHP_SELF'] is used for most form actions, ， and also for creating internal links, the string \"><script>alert('xss') ， </script> can be used to create a path-info XSS that exploits any ， logged-in user. The URI parameters are irrelevant and have been ， ommitted to keep the example clean. ， Example: ， /index.php/%22%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert('xss')%3C/script%3E/?[params] ， 2) Remote XSS in RSS ， vtiger features a comprehensive RSS aggregation module, allowing users ， to read all their favorite blogs, news sites or other feeds from within ， the CRM. However, no input checking is performed before aggregated feeds ， are sent to the client. A malicious blog, news site or other feed could ， socially engineer a user into aggregating it and then use script code to ， elevate their privileges via DOM. ， We are featuring this as a different attack class since the vector does"
