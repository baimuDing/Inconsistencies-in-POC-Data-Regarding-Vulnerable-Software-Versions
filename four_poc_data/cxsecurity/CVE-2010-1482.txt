The personal options page at admin/editprefs.php contains the field ， date_format_string , which is not properly escaped and can be filled with ， Javascript-code , e.g. \"><script>alert ( 1 ) </script>. ， As this page cannot be viewed by the admin or other users , this only allows ， quite unlikely attack scenarios , so the impact should be considered very low. ， Vendor has released 1.7.1 , which filters out HTML-tags and restricts the field ， size to 10 chars. Filtering out HTML-tags alone does not help , as one can ， still use JavaScript event handlers ( e.g. onMouseOver )  , but 10 chars doesn't ， allow any useful code to be injected. The proper solution would be escaping ， the output including quotes. So this is fixed , but it's not a very clean ， solution.",
