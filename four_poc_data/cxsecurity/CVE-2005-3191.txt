BACKGROUND ， Xpdf is an open-source viewer for Portable Document Format ( PDF ) files. ， II. DESCRIPTION ， Local exploitation of a heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability in ， xpdf , as included in various vendors' operating system distributions ,  ， could allow attackers to cause a denial of service condition ,  ， potentially resulting in arbitrary code execution. ， The vulnerability specifically exists due to insufficient input ， validation in the DCT stream parsing code. The ， DCTStream : readBaselineSOF function from xpdf/Stream.cc takes the value ， of numComps from user-controllable data from within the PDF file. The ， numComps value is used in a loop to copy data from the file into a pre- ， allocated buffer in the heap , shown as follows :  ， GBool DCTStream : readBaselineSOF (  ) { ， . ， numComps = str->getChar (  )  ;  ， . ， compInfo [ i ] .id = str->getChar (  )  ;  ， c = str->getChar (  )  ;  ， compInfo [ i ] .hSample = ( c 4 ) & 0x0f ;  ， compInfo [ i ] .vSample = c & 0x0f ;  ， compInfo [ i ] .quantTable = str->getChar (  )  ;  ， } ， . ， Overly large values supplied to numComps will result in corruption of ， heap memory resulting in a DoS condition , potentially resulting in ， arbitrary code execution. ， III. ANALYSIS ， Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can result in arbitrary ， code execution with privileges of the xpdf process. Currently ,  ， exploitation resulting in code execution is theoretical and dependant ， on the process memory layout. A typical exploitation attempt would ， require an attacker to supply a malicious .pdf to the victim. The ， victim would need to open the corrupt .pdf file in xpdf , triggering the ， vulnerability. ， IV. DETECTION ， iDefense has confirmed the existence of this vulnerability in xpdf ， 3.01. All earlier versions of xpdf are suspected vulnerable. ， The following vendors include susceptible xpdf packages within their ， operating system distributions :  ， . The Debian Project : Linux 3.0 and 3.1 ， V. WORKAROUND ， iDefense is currently unaware of any effective workarounds for this ， vulnerability. ， VI. VENDOR RESPONSE ， A patch for this vulnerability is available at :  ， ftp : /ftp.foolabs.com/pub/xpdf/xpdf-3.01pl1.patch ， Updated binaries ( version 3.01pl1 ) are available at :  ， VII. CVE INFORMATION ， The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures ( CVE ) project has assigned the ， name CAN-2005-3191 to this issue. This is a candidate for inclusion in ， the CVE list ( which standardizes names for ， security problems.",
