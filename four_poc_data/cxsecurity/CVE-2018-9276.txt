    "text": "vul_name : PRTG Command Injection ， vul_cve : CVE-2018-9276 ， vul_poc : Bugtraq ,  ， I ( Josh Berry ) discovered an authenticated command injection vulnerability ， in the Demo PowerShell notification script provided by versions of PRTG ， Network Monitor prior to 18.2.39. The PowerShell notifications demo script ， on versions of the application prior to 18.2.39 do not properly sanitize ， input in the Parameter field. The web application provides a security ， control around running executables/scripts as part of a notification , but ， the demo PowerShell script contains a command injection vulnerability. As a ， proof of concept , the following value can be passed in the Parameter ， field , resulting in the creation of a test account named pentest :  ， Test.txt ; net user pentest p3nT3st ! /add ， This bypasses the security control in place for the application. I notified ， Paessler AG , the developer of the application , and they have since patched ， the issue and assigned a CVE of CVE-2018-9276. Additional details are ， provided below :  ，  # Vulnerability Title : PRTG < 18.2.39 Command Injection Vulnerability ，  # Google Dork : N/A , but more details at :  ，  # Date : Initial report : 2/14/2018 , disclosed on 6/25/2018 ，  # Exploit Author : Josh Berry ，  # Vendor Homepage :  ，  # Software Link :  ，  # Vulnerable Version Tested : 18.1.37.12158 ，  # Patched Version : 18.2.39 ，  # Tested on : Windows 7 and Windows Server 2012 R2 ，  # CVE : CVE-2018-9276 ， Outside of patching , a workaround would be to just remove the PowerShell ， demo script from the notifications directory found in the documentation :  ， Note that exploiting this issue requires authenticated access. The tool ， installs with the default credentials of prtgadmin / prtgadmin ， -the-prtg-web-interface-and-enterprise-console-how-to-change )  , and it is ， common for organizations to leave defaults in place or take time in changing ， them based on my penetration testing experience. ， Thanks ,  ， Josh Berry , OSCP & GCIA Gold ， Project Lead - CodeWatch ， Cell 469.831.8543 | josh.berry @ codewatch.org | www.codewatch.org",
