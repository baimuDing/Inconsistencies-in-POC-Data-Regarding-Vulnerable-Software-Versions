Description :  ，  # An issue was discovered in phpMyAdmin 4.8.x before 4.8.2 , in which an attacker can include ( view and potentially execute ) files on the server. The vulnerability comes from a portion of code where pages are redirected and loaded within phpMyAdmin , and an improper test for whitelisted pages. An attacker must be authenticated , except in the \" $ cfg [ 'AllowArbitraryServer' ] = true\" case ( where an attacker can specify any host he/she is already in control of , and execute arbitrary code on phpMyAdmin ) and the \" $ cfg [ 'ServerDefault' ] = 0\" case ( which bypasses the login requirement and runs the vulnerable code without any authentication ) .",
