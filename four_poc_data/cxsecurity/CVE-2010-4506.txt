Users can reset their ， password or unlock their Windows account directly from their locked out ， workstation , so that they can get to their applications within seconds - without ， having to pick up the telephone or go to another workstation. ， Credit : Garrett Held of Trustwave's SpiderLabs ， CVE : CVE-2010-4506 ， Finding :  ， When a user clicks the button on the login window to reset their Windows ， or AD password , a locked-down IE browser shows a form to answer questions ， before allowing a reset. If for any reason an invalid SSL Certificate is ， used by the password reset site , the resulting Internet Explorer alert will ， ask if the user would like to accept , deny , or view the details. By ， navigating through the windows using the following method , a user can execute ， a program without authentication. ， When the certificate error popup is shown there will be three tabs :  ， \"General\" , \"Details\" , and \"Certification Path\" Choose the \"Details\" tab then ， click on the \"Copy to File\" button that is now shown in the bottom right. ， This will cause a \"Certificate Export\" wizard to appear. ， Click the \"Next >\" button until you reach the \"File To Export\" page ，  ( third page ) which displays a \"Browse\" button. Click this and a \"Save As\" ， dialog box will appear which also allows you to navigate the filesystem. You ， can now browse the file system for executables such as \"explorer.exe\" and ， launch an application by right clicking the file and selecting \"Open\". ， While an SSL certificate left to expire may create this problem , other ， methods may be used to induce certificate failures , such as :  ，  * Man-In-The-Middle attack , which requires network access to spoof the ， router and relay any certificate back to client except a valid one. ，  * System settings change , such as a future date , which would not match the ， certificate.",
