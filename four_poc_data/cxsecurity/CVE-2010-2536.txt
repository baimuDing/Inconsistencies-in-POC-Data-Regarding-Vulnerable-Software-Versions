    "text": "vul_name : rekonq Error Page Cross-Site Scripting Vulnerability ， vul_cve : CVE-2010-2536 ， vul_poc : Version : 0.2.90 ( using 4.3.2 ( KDE 4.3.2 )  , Debian packages )  ， Compiler : cc ， OS : Linux ( x86_64 ) release 2.6.31-1-amd64 ， Rekonq is affected by a universal XSS and / or crash. Opening a fresh instance ， of Rekonq and entering the following URL causes a crash :  ， However , if you enter this into a new tab on an existing instance of Rekonq ， then it will first try and resolve the hostname and then when that fails it ， will display an error message. The error message output by Rekonq includes the ， full URL , including the <script> tags. Since Rekonq see that the requested URL ， is part of * .twitter.com and since twitter.com sets wildcard domain'd cookies ,  ， the error page will be able to access any cookies that have been set. Note ， that this is not unique to twitter.com , cookies can be stole for any site that ， sets wildcard domain'd cookies. ， There are therefore 3 issues :  ， 1 ) Crash on fresh instance ， 2 ) Injection of malicious content into error message ， 3 ) Access to cookies when the hostname under which the cookies have been set ， was not accessible ， I believe the root cause of 2 is :  ， rekonq-mainline/src/webpage.cpp : msg += \"<h2>\" + i18nc ( \"%1=an URL ,  ， e.g.'kde.org'\" , \"When connecting to : %1\" , reply->url (  ) .toString (  ) + \"</h2>\" ;  ， Note that there is no sanitisation of reply->url (  ) .toString (  )  ! I haven't ， investigated the others in any depth but I will update the bug with a stack ， trace for 1 shortly.",
