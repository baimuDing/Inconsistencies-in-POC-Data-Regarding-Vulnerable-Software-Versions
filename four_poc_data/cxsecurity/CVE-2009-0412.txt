It combines easy-to-customize store designs with marketing tools proven to significantly increase your sales. ， In v4.0.1 , ISC suffers from an authentication bypass problem. This allows anyone to login to ISC's control panel without knowing the administrator's password. ， The problem is with `class.auth.php`'s `ProcessLogin` function. This function sets a HTTPOnly cookie flag `RememberToken` too early in the process , even before the user is authenticated. A malicious user could force `ProcessLogin` to set this cookie by ticking on `Remember me` at the login page , entering targeted username such as `admin` , and anything as password. This first attemp will fail , but the cookie is already set , and ready to authenticate him/her to the control panel. ， Blue Moon Consulting has verified the bug in version 4.0.1 Ultimate edition being showcased at It is highly likely that it also exists in older versions. ， Workaround ， There is no workaround. Please apply the fix. ， Fix ， The problem has been fixed in v4.0.2. ， Disclosure ， Blue Moon Consulting adapts `RFPolicy v2.0 < in notifying vendors. ，  : Initial vendor contact :  ， January 07 , 2009 : Initial contact sent to customerservice ( at ) interspire ( dot ) com [ email concealed ] and sales ( at ) interspire ( dot ) com [ email concealed ]  ，  : Vendor response :  ， January 08 , 2009 : Chris Boulton requested further communications to be addressed to him directly. ，  : Further communication :  ， January 08 , 2009 : Prepared advisory is sent to Chris and regular update is requested. ， January 08 , 2009 : Chris updated us with a proper fix. ， January 08 , 2009 : Mitchell Harper updated us with Interspire's notification to their customers. ， January 08 , 2009 : Mitchell and Chris requested us to hold off full disclosure in 6 weeks to allow time for Interspire customers to get patched. ， January 08 , 2009 : We agreed to hold it off till 4.0.2 was released. ， January 08 , 2009 : Draft advisory was sent to Chris and Mitchell. ， January 08 , 2009 : Chris clarified that 4.0.2 had been released to address the issue.",
