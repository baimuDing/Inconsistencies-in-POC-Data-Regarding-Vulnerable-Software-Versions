BACKGROUND ， GNU Wget is a free software package for retrieving files using HTTP ,  ， HTTPS and FTP , the most widely-used Internet protocols. It is a ， non-interactive commandline tool , so it may easily be called from ， scripts , cron jobs , terminals without X-Windows support , etc. More ， information on Wget is available from the vendor website :  ， curl is a command line tool for transferring files with URL syntax ,  ， supporting FTP , FTPS , HTTP , HTTPS , GOPHER , TELNET , DICT , FILE and LDAP. ， Curl supports HTTPS certificates , HTTP POST , HTTP PUT , FTP uploading ,  ， HTTP form based upload , proxies , cookies , user+password authentication ，  ( Basic , Digest , NTLM , Negotiate , kerberos. )  , file transfer resume ,  ， proxy tunneling and a busload of other useful tricks. More information ， on curl is available from the vendor website :  ， II. DESCRIPTION ， Remote exploitation of a buffer overflow vulnerability in multiple ， vendor's implementations of curl and wget allows attackers to execute ， arbitrary code. ， The vulnerability specifically exists due to insufficient bounds ， checking on user-supplied data supplied to a memory copy operation. The ， memcpy (  ) of the supplied ntlm username to ntlmbuf shown below results ， in a stack overflow :  ， http-ntlm.c in ntlm_output (  ) on line 532 :  ， / * size is now 64 * / ， size=64 ;  ， ntlmbuf [ 62 ] =ntlmbuf [ 63 ] =0 ;  ， memcpy ( &ntlmbuf [ size ]  , domain , domlen )  ;  ， size += domlen ;  ， memcpy ( &ntlmbuf [ size ]  , usr , userlen )  ;  ， size += userlen ;  ， The resulting stack overflow can be leveraged to gain arbitrary code ， execution with user privileges. ， III. ANALYSIS ， Successful exploitation of the vulnerability allows remote attackers to ， execute arbitrary code with permissions of the http client process. ， User interaction is required. Exploitation requires a user to use one ， of the affected clients to connect to a malicious website. ， This vulnerability affects both wget and curl clients similarly because ， wget 1.10 adopted the curl ntlm authentication source code into its own ， code base. The described vulnerability requires that ntlm authentication ， is enabled in the affected client versions. A factor that somewhat ， increases the risk of this vulnerability is that a client can be forced ， to reconnect using ntlm authentication by issuing a HTTP 302 REDIRECT ， command to the connecting client. ， IV. DETECTION ， iDEFENSE Labs has confirmed the following software versions are ， vulnerable :  ，  * wget 1.10 ，  * curl 7.13.2 ，  * libcurl 7.13.2 ， V. WORKAROUND ， As a workaround solution , disable NTLM support in wget and curl ， installations. ， VI. VENDOR RESPONSE ， wget 1.10.2 has been released to address this issue and is available for ， download at :  ， curl has released the following patch to address this issue :  ， curl has also released the following security advisory :  ， Additionally , the maintainers of curl-web have provided the following ， details on affected versions :  ， Affected versions : curl and libcurl 7.10.6 to and including 7.14.1 ， Not affected versions : curl and libcurl 7.10.5 and earlier ,  ， 7.15.0 and later ， VII. CVE INFORMATION ， The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures ( CVE ) project has assigned the ， name CAN-2005-3185 to this issue. This is a candidate for inclusion in ， the CVE list ( which standardizes names for ， security problems.",
