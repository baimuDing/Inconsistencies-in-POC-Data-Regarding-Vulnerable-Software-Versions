These ， vulnerabilities ， were the findings of the requested audit. ， Stack overflows fed via the command line , environment variables or ， WordNet library calls can result in arbitrary code execution. ， Stack and heap overflows via modified WordNet dictionaries may allow ， arbitrary ， code execution. ， It should be noted that despite the ease with which arbitrary code can ， be executed via these WordNet flaws , unless WordNet is being used by a ， daemon or web ， service running as a user other than that of the attacker , this is ， unlikely to ， result in privilege escalation or the ability to take any action not ， already ， possible as the attacking user. ， The following patch fixes the issues :  ， Affected version :  ， WordNet = 3.0 ， Fixed version :  ， Princeton unfortunately lack the resources to produce a new release of ， this ， code and will therefore not be releasing a new version as a result of ， this ， audit. ， Credit : Rob Holland , oCERT Team | Inverse Path Ltd ， CVE : TBD",
