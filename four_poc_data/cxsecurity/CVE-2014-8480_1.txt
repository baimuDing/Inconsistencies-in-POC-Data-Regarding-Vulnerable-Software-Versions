    "text": "vul_name : Linux 3.17 guest-triggerable KVM OOPS ， vul_cve : CVE-2014-8480 , CVE-2014-8481 ， vul_poc : On Linux 3.17 , a KVM guest can trigger a NULL pointer dereference by ， forcing the host to emulate certain well-formed RIP-relative ， instructions or certain types of corrupt or page-straddling ， instructions. This is almost certainly just a DoS - there is a ， single read-modify-write to the NULL pointer , and no kernel code will ， consume data loaded from the NULL pointer if something is mapped ， there. ， The bugs , or at least dangerous code , arguably existed in much older ， kernels , but the NULL pointer dereference was introduced in ， 41061cdb98a0bec464278b4db8e894a3121671f5 , which is only present in ， 3.17. ， To fix it , you can either revert the broken patch or you can apply ， both patches here as well as the attached patch :  ，  ( NB : I'm not sure whether \"Emulator does not decode clflush well\" is necessary. )  ， Details :  ， Depending on your point of view , there are either one or two bugs ， here. Nadav Amit discovered an error in the instruction decoder that ， would cause certain RIP-relative instructions to OOPS the decoder. ， Specifically , rather than adding RIP to the operand address , RIP would ， be added to * 0 from the host's perspective. ， I wrote an ugly proof-of-concept to trigger it ( kvm_clflush_oops.c ,  ， although I've cleaned it up somewhat since I originally wrote it ) . ， That PoC only works on an SMP guest , and only when run as root. ， I also discovered that Nadav's fix was incomplete ( or that there was ， another bug , depending on your perspective ) . Certain invalid ， instructions ( due to multiple error cases , including a failure to ， fetch part of the instruction or due to the instruction being too ， long ) could trigger the same NULL pointer dereference. ， Nadav wrote an extremely elegant PoC that exploits this buggy error ， handling , reproduced with permission below. This PoC doesn't require ， SMP or privilege ; it's just crashes the host directly. Figuring out ， how it works is left as an exercise to the reader ( hint : it might not ， work on Atom hosts ) . ， Please assign one or two CVEs as appropriate. ( And , if you're hosting ， untrusted code on a Linux 3.17 host , patch your system !  ) ",
