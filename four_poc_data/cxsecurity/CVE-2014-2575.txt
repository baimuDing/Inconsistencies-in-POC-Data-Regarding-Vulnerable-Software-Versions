Attackers with access to the File Manager component can ， read arbitrary files on the same partition as the shared directory. ， A common request to download a file via the File Manager component ， requires multiple HTTP-Post parameters :  ， _EVENTTARGET=ctl00%24ContentPlaceHolder1%24ASPxFileManager1 ， _EVENTARGUMENT=13%7C<file.ext> ， _EVENTVALID= ， The parameter _EVENTARGUMENT=13 | <file.ext> specifies a file download ， and the file which is to be downloaded. Attackers may also request files ， outside of the shared directory by prepending a relative path to a ， parent directory. ， Proof of Concept ， By requesting files with a relative path , files otherwise not available ， will be accessible through the File Manager component. Depending on the ， shared directory and the webserver configuration , the webserver ， configuration file might for example be accessible through the File ， Manager component :  ， _EVENTARGUMENT=13 | ././web.config ， Other sensitive operating system files could be affected , too.",
