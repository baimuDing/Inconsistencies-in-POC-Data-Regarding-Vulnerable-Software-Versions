This ， vulnerability affects customers using versions at or below 2.3.6.15, ， 2.5.2.11, 2.5.4.25, 2.5.5.7, 3.1.1.3, and 2.4.8.11-FIPS using LDAP ， authentication for management and VPN (PAP-L2TP) users. ， DETAILS ， Aruba Mobility Controllers may use external authentication methods to ， authenticate administrative and VPN users. A vulnerability in the ， LDAP authentication component may allow unauthorized use of ， LDAP-authenticated administrative and PAP-L2TP users. LDAP is not the ， default authentication method and must be configured as an ， authentication method for users before it will be used. By default, ， administrative user accounts and passwords are kept in a local ， database which is not vulnerable to this defect. Other VPN ， authentication methods supported by the Aruba Mobility Controller are ， not vulnerable to this defect. ， IMPACT ， An attacker with access to the management or VPN interfaces of an ， Aruba Mobility Controller and knowledge of an existing account may be ， able to access the Aruba Mobility Controller with the access levels of ， that account (for administrative users) or access the VPN services ， (for VPN users). ， CVSS BASE METRIC SCORE: 10 ， WORKAROUNDS ， See Solution below. ， SOLUTION ， Aruba Networks recommends that all customers apply the appropriate ， patche(es) as soon as practical. However, in the event that a patch ， cannot immediately be applied, the following steps will help to ， mitigate the risk: ， - - - Do not expose the Mobility Controller administrative interface to ， untrusted networks such as the Internet. ， - - - Disable LDAP authentication for administrative accounts until such ， time as the patches can be applied. ， - - - Disable LDAP authentication for VPN users until such time as the ， patches can be applied. ， - - - Disable anonymous binds in the LDAP server until such time as the ， patches can be applied. ， OBTAINING FIXED FIRMWARES ， Aruba customers can obtain the firmware on the support website: ， Aruba Support contacts are as follows: ， 1-800-WiFiLAN (1-800-943-4526) (toll free from within North ， America) ， +1-408-754-1200 (toll call from anywhere in the world) ， e-mail: support(at)arubanetworks.com ， Please, do not contact either \"wsirt(at)arubanetworks.com\" or ， \"security(at)arubanetworks.com\" for software upgrades. ， EXPLOITATION AND PUBLIC ANNOUNCEMENTS ， This vulnerability will be announced at ， Aruba W.S.I.R.T.
