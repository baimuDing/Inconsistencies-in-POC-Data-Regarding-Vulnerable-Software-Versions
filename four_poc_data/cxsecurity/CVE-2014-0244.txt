    "text": "vul_name : Samba 4.1.8 remote Denial of Service ， vul_cve : CVE-2014-0244 ， vul_poc : Description of problem :  ， I'm running samba3x ( samba3x-3.6.6-0.139.el5_10 ) as an simple NT domain controler on a CentOS 5.10 , and found sometime the nmbd process stuck ( eating 100% CPU , and not responding anymore to any request , making any domain login impossible ) . The only solution was to kill -9 this process and restart it. It was occuring randomly , so was quite hard to troubleshoot , but after a few hours , I've finaly identified what's causing it ( well at least , I know a simple request from a client is enough to trigger it )  ， I'll attach :  ， - a strace of the process at the time the problem occure. In this file the last lines ( recvfrom ( 12 , 0xbfcff9c8 , 576 , 0 , 0xbfcffc08 , 0xbfcff988 ) = -1 EAGAIN ( Resource temporarily unavailable ) is repeated indefinitly as long as the process isn't killed , producing several GB per hour in the strace file. I've truncated it to the interesting part",
