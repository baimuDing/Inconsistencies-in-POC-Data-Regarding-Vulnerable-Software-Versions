BACKGROUND ， GTK+ is a multi-platform toolkit for creating graphical user interfaces. ， Offering a complete set of widgets , GTK+ is suitable for projects ， ranging from small one-off projects to complete application suites. ， II. DESCRIPTION ， Remote exploitation of heap overflow vulnerability in various vendors' ， implementations of the GTK+ gdk-pixbuf XPM image rendering library could ， allow for arbitrary code execution. ， The vulnerability specifically exists due to an integer overflow while ， processing XPM files. The following code snippet illustrates the ， vulnerability :  ， g_set_error ( error ,  ， GDK_PIXBUF_ERROR ,  ， GDK_PIXBUF_ERROR_CORRUPT_IMAGE ,  ， _ ( \"XPM file has invalid number of colors\" )  ;  ， } ，  [ . ]  ， colors = ( XPMColor *  ) g_try_malloc ( sizeof ( XPMColor )  * n_col )  ;  ，  [ . ]  ， The validity check of n_col is enough to prevent an integer overflow in ， the first g_try_malloc , however there is not a proper check for the ， second g_try_malloc , which allows an undersized heap buffer to be ， allocated , then overflowed while using n_col as an upper bounds in a ， copying loop. This can be used to execute arbitrary code via traditional ， heap overflow 4 byte write methods or by overwriting adjacent areas of ， the heap with important values such as function pointers. ， III. ANALYSIS ， Exploitation could allow for arbitrary code execution in the context of ， the user running the affected application. As this library is used in a ， variety of applications , this vulnerability could be exploited either ， remotely , via a networked application or locally. ， IV. DETECTION ， iDEFENSE has confirmed the existence of this vulnerability in gtk+ 2.4.0 ， compiled from source. It is suspected that previous versions are also ， affected by this vulnerability. The following vendors include ， susceptible GTK+ and GdkPixBuf packages within their respective ， operating system distributions :  ， The Debian Project :  ， Debian GNU/Linux 3.0 and 3.1 ( all architectures )  ， Mandriva ( formerly Mandrakesoft )  :  ， Mandriva Linux ( formerly Mandrakelinux ) 10.0 and 10.1 ,  ， Corporate Server 3.0 ， Novell Inc. :  ， SuSE Linux 8.2 , 9.0 , 9.1 and 9.2 ， Red Hat Inc. :  ， Red Hat Enterprise Linux 2.1 , 3 , 4 ,  ， Fedora Core 3 , 4 ， V. WORKAROUND ， Users should not open untrusted media files. ， VI. VENDOR RESPONSE ， Red Hat Inc. :  ， \"This issue affects the gtk2 packages as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise ， Linux 3 and 4 , and the gdk-pixbuf packages as shipped with Red Hat ， Enterprise Linux 2.1 , 3 , and 4. Updates to these packages are available ， at the URL below or by using the Red Hat Network up2date tool. ， This issue affects the gtk2 and gdk-pixbuf packages as shipped with ， Fedora Core 3 and 4.\" ， VII. CVE INFORMATION ， The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures ( CVE ) project has assigned the ， name CAN-2005-3186 to this issue. This is a candidate for inclusion in ， the CVE list ( which standardizes names for ， security problems.",
