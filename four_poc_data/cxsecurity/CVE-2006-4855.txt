It is possible to open this driver and send arbitrary data to it, which are ， implicitly believed to be valid. It is possible to assemble the data in the input buffer such that the driver performs ， an invalid memory operation and crashes the whole operating system. Further impacts of this bug were not examined. ， Vulnerable software: ， * Norton Personal Firewall 2006 version 9.1.0.33 ， * probably all versions of Norton Personal Firewall 2006 and Norton Internet Security 2006 ， * possibly older versions of Norton Personal Firewall and Norton Internet Security ， More details and a proof of concept including source code is available here: ， f-SymEvent-driver-input-buffer.php ， Regards, ， David Matousek ， Founder and Chief Representative of Matousec - Transparent security"
