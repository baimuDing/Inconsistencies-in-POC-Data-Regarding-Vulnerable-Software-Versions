No CVE name was assigned to the jar issue, ， however it looks like they are two different programs with two different ， code bases. ， There is also some confusion because these issues are similar to (or a ， result of incomplete fixes for) CVE-2006-3619 (fastjar) and ， CVE-2005-1080 (jar). ， What makes things worse is that it doesn't look like CVE-2005-1080 was ， ever fixed. So I'm not sure if this \"new\" jar issue needs a new CVE ， name, or if it would be covered under CVE-2005-1080 (since nothing ever ， claimed to fix this directory traversal vulnerability in jar). ， Any insight from MITRE would be appreciated. I've not assigned a CVE ， name to the \"new\" jar issue because of this confusion."
