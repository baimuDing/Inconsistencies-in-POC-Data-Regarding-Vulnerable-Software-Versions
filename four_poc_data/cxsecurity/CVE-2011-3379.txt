    "text": "vul_name : PHP 5.3.7+ issue is_a function ， vul_cve : CVE-2011-3379 ， vul_poc : PHP 5.3.7 changed the behavior of the is_a (  ) function , used to check if an object is an instance of a class , to call the _autoload (  ) function. This causes a remote code execute problem when coupled with a standard library like PEAR that internally uses is_a to check if a returned variable is an Error object or not. ， An unprotected _autoload (  ) function that blindly includes based upon the variable it receives can be tricked into including a remote file by , for example , uploading a specially crafted file containing a link to a remote website. ， Full explanation + code example has been posted on our website at ， 5-3-7-5-3-8/ and has been e-mailed to security ( at ) php ( dot ) net [ email concealed ]  ， Cipriano Groenendal",
