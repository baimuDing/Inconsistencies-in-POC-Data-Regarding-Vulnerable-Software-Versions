Via JavaScript the attacker is able to cause the user?s browser to do almost anything including add users , delete posts , and even modify PHP files if that option hasn?t been disabled. ， Proof of concept ， Pressing the submit button here will change the logo setting to contain some JavaScript. Browsers with no reflected XSS prevention ( like Firefox ) will execute the JavaScript immediately , other browsers will execute the JavaScript when the page is loaded next.",
