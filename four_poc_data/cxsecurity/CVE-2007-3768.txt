This concerns the PASV command and its response from the ， mirrored server. SurgeFTP fails to parse a response to PASV properly so that ， it will crash if the response was malformated. ， Impact :  ， It may be possible for an attacker to shut down the service. By default ,  ， SurgeFTP respawns after a couple of seconds. But then , immediately reconnects ， to the mirrored server. As long as the attacker keeps sending malformated ， PASV responses to the server , it will keep shutting down immediately after ， restarting. ， Exploit :  ， The proof of concept exploit code is available. ， Vendor Status :  ， Vendor notified. The vulnerability has been fixed. ， Copyright :  ， Copyright ?
