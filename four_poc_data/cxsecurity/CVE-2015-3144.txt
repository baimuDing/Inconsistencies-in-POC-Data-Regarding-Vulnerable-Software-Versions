    "text": "vul_name : cURL libcurl 7.41.0 DoS by a zero-length host name ， vul_cve : CVE-2015-3144 ， vul_poc : VULNERABILITY ， There is a private function in libcurl called fix_hostname (  ) that removes a trailing dot from the host name if there is one. The function is called after the host name has been extracted from the URL libcurl has been told to act on. ， If a URL is given with a zero-length host name , like in \" or just \" : 80\" , fix_hostname (  ) will index the host name pointer with a -1 offset ( as it blindly assumes a non-zero length ) and both read and assign that address. ， At best , this gets unnoticed but can also lead to a crash or worse. We have not researched further what kind of malicious actions that potentially this could be used for. ， We are not aware of any exploits of this flaw. ， INFO ， This flaw can also be triggered with the curl command line tool. ， The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures ( CVE ) project has assigned the name CVE-2015-3144 to this issue. ， AFFECTED VERSIONS ， Affected versions : from libcurl 7.37.0 to and including 7.41.0 ， Not affected versions : libcurl >= 7.42.0 ， libcurl is used by many applications , but not always advertised as such !  ， THE SOLUTION ， libcurl 7.42.0 better verifies the input string to the affected function. ， A patch for this problem is available at [ URL will be updated ]  :  ， From 6218ded6001ea330e589f92b6b2fa12777752b5d Mon Sep 17 00 : 00 : 00 2001 ， From : Daniel Stenberg <daniel @ hax.se> ， Date : Thu , 16 Apr 2015 23 : 52 : 04 +0200 ， Subject :  [ PATCH ] fix_hostname : zero length host name caused -1 index offset ， MIME-Version : 1.0 ， Content-Type : text/plain ; charset=UTF-8 ， Content-Transfer-Encoding : 8bit ， If a URL is given with a zero-length host name , like in \" or ， just \" : 80\" , `fix_hostname (  ) ` will index the host name pointer with a -1 ， offset ( as it blindly assumes a non-zero length ) and both read and ， assign that address. ， CVE-2015-3144",
