    "text": "vul_name : Roller Weblogger XSS vulnerability ， vul_cve : CVE-2006-4856 ， vul_poc :  ， I. BACKGROUND ， Roller is the open source blog server that drives Sun Microsystem's blogs.sun.com employee blogging site , IBM DeveloperWorks blogs , thousands of internal blogs at IBM Blog Central , the Javalobby's 10 , 000 user strong JRoller Java community site , and hundreds of other blogs world-wide. More information is available at the following address :  ， II. DESCRIPTION ， Remote exploitation of a Cross-Site Scripting ( XSS ) vulnerability in the Roller allows an attacker to force to inject arbitrary script code into a users session , possibly stealing logon credentials. ， To demonstrate the vulnerability , simply embed the following encoded text into the identified vulnerable fields. ， >'><script>alert ( 1234 ) </script> ， This will have the affect of popping up an alert window. This proof of concept could easily be altered to cause the script to return authentication credentials to an attacker controlled server. ， III. ANALYSIS ， Successful exploitation of this vulnerability would allow an attacker to inject arbitrary script code into the session. This could allow for the theft of authentication information , which could lead to a compromised account. ， In order for exploitation to occur , the targeted user would only have to view a blog entry from an attacker. This vulnerability has a high potential for widespread exploitation. ， IV. DETECTION ， Roller 2.3 Web application has been confirmed vulnerable. ， SNORT RULES :  ， alert tcp any any -> $ HOME_NET $ HTTP_PORTS ( msg : \"Roller Weblog XSS exploit\" ; flow : to_server ; content : \"post\" ; depth : 4 ; nocase ; content : \"method=post\" ; nocase ; pcre : \"/ ( name | email | url ) . * =. * %22. * %3e. * %3cscript%3e. * %3c%2fscript%3e. * &/i ， \" ; classtype : web-application-activity ; sid : 9999991 ; rev : 1 ;  )  ， alert tcp any any -> $ HOME_NET $ HTTP_PORTS ( msg : \"Roller Weblog XSS exploit\" ; flow : to_server ; content : \"post\" ; depth : 4 ; nocase ; content : \"method=preview\" ; nocase ; pcre : \"/content. * =. * %3c%2ftextarea%3e%3cscript%3e. * %3c%2fscript%3e/i\" ; classtype : web-application-activity ; sid : 9999992 ; rev : 1 ;  )  ， alert tcp any any -> $ HOME_NET $ HTTP_PORTS ( msg : \"Roller Weblog XSS exploit\" ; flow : to_server ; content : \"get\" ; depth : 3 ; nocase ; pcre : \"/sitesearch.do?q=. * %3cscript%3e. * %3c%2fscript%3e/i\" ; classtype : web-application-activity ; sid : 9999993 ; rev : 1 ;  )  ， V. WORKAROUND ， Cenzic is currently unaware of any effective workarounds that can be implemented on the server in order to mitigate the risk of this vulnerability ; however , there are workarounds available for client ， protection. Since exploitation allows for the execution of malicious code in web browsers , successful exploitation could be thwarted by disabling script code and active content support within a client browser. Take note that employing this workaround could adversely affect web sites reliant upon the execution of browser-based script code. The following steps can be taken to disable active scripting in ， Mozilla and Internet Explorer :  ， Internet Explorer 5.0 , 5.01 , 5.5 , 6 ， a. On the Tools menu , click Internet Options , click the Security tab , click the Internet Web content zone , and then click Custom Level. ， b. In the Settings box , scroll down to the Scripting section , and click Disable under Active scripting and Scripting of Java applets. ， c. Click OK , and then click OK again. ， Mozilla Firefox ， a. On the Tools menu , click Options and click the Web Features tab. ， b. De-select the Enable JavaScript checkbox. ， c. Click OK. ， VI. VENDOR RESPONSE ， We have a release candidate available now for testing , but we need ， three votes from the Apache Incubator Program Management Committee ，  ( PMC ) before we can make the release official. So let's ask the PMC. ， PMC members , please chime in. The release is 2.3 plus one bug fix ，  ( strip markup from name and URL field in comments form ) . What would ， you like to see happen before we call this a release? ， You can get the release candidate here :  ， The bug report :  ， Vendor contact name : Dave Johnson ， Vendor contact phone : N/A ， Vendor contact e-mail : dave [ dot ] johnson [ at ] rollerweblogger [ dot ] org ， Vendor reference number : N/A ， VII. CVE / CERT INFORMATION ， CERT has assigned a tracking number VU # 366900. They take upto 45 days to make a public disclosure.",
