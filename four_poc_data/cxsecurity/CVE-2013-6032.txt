The interface does not perform sufficient validation of the vac.255.GENPASSWORD parameter in POST requests to the /cgi-bin/postpf/cgi-bin/dynamic/config/config.html page , allowing an unauthenticated remote attacker to reset the administrative password to an empty string. ， CWE-79 : Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ( 'Cross-site Scripting' ) - CVE-2013-6033 ， Certain models of Lexmark laser printers are vulnerable to stored cross-site scripting attacks. The printers' administrative web interface does not perform sufficient validation of user input to the \"Location\" and \"Contact Name\" fields in the \"General Settings\" configuration page. ， A list of affected models and firmware versions can be found at Lexmark's advisory page. ， The CVSS score reflects CVE-2013-6032. ， Impact ， An attacker may be able to run arbitrary script in the context of a victim's browser. The attacker may also be able to gain full administrative control of the printer. ， Solution ， Apply an Update ， Lexmark advises users to update to the latest firmware version. A list of affected models and firmware versions , as well as accompanying fixes , can be found at Lexmark's advisory page.",
