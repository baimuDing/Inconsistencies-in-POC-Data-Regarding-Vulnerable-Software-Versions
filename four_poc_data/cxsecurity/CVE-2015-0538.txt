By sending a specifically crafted packet to the AutoStart agent ( ftagent.exe ) running on the remote system , it is possible to execute arbitrary commands with the highest privilege level of the affected system ( NT / Authority System privilege for Windows and root privilege for Linux platforms ) . Exploitation of this vulnerability requires an attacker to know the Autostart domain name ( if no default value is used ) and the node list.",
