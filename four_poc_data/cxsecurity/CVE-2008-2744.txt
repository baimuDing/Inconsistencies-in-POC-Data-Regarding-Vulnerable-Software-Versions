This advisory is here to detail what the ， XSS is and how wrong Jelsoft are for assuming that XSS is harmless. ， First , the discussion of exactly what the exploit is. The XSS in question ， exists on the login page for the ACP ( admin control panel ) . The login ， script takes a redirect parameter that lacks sanitation , allowing a ， rather easy XSS :  ， Yes , here goes the obscure. What is even better is that the exploit will ， work outright if the admin is already logged in ; if the admin is not , they ， will be required to log in. If you Base64-encode your attack vector using ， the data : URI scheme , the XSS survives the login request and activates after ， the admin is logged in. A simple example of the above :  ， NjcmlwdD5hbGVydCgnWFNTJyk8L3NjcmlwdD4K ， Now to address the quote \"potential for exposure and damage is limited\". ， Clearly Jelsoft have never seen what one can do with an XSS. In this case ， you have an unlimited and unaltered XSS space , so you're free to invoke some ， AJAX and have fun. Just to give ideas on how this could turn into something ， larger , vBulletin has hooks that operate using eval (  )  , and new hooks can ， be added via the ACP itself. It is trivial to write some JS that not only ， enables hooks but also inserts a nice RFI hook. Here's one using the data ， URI : ",
