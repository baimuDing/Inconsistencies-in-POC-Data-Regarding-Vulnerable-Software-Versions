Yes , the file (  )  ， call could be used to access a file that the attacker can control , but ， the only use of the $ ips array is in checking for banned addresses. ， The use of file (  ) is not the same as include (  ) or require (  ) . ， So - attackers could use this to bypass a ban against their IP address ， because they can control the ban file , but that's not the same as ， \"inclusion.\" ， - Steve",
