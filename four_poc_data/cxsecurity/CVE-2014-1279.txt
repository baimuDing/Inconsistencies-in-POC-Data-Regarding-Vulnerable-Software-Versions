This data ， includes hexadecimal representations of the configuration information ， transferred from the mobile device to the Apple TV , including AppleID and ， Wi-Fi passwords passed in cleartext. ， An attacker with access to an Apple TV may be able to recover this data from ， the system log , if it has been stored on the Apple TV. ， Details ， Apple TV applications may save certain logging and debugging information to ， the system using NSLog (  ) and similar mechanisms. The logs may be viewed by ， attaching the Apple TV unit to an OS X system via a micro-USB cable , and ， using an application such as the Xcode Organizer or iPhone Configuration ， Utility. ， In general , these log entries are ephemeral , however , certain log data on ， the Apple TV ( and other iOS devices in general ) are retained to some degree ， on the device filesystem and may thus be available for viewing at a later ， date. At this time , it is not clear whether the Touch Setup logs are ， retained on the Apple TV or mobile iOS device after completion of the setup ， process. ， The Apple TV app ( as well as the touchsetupd daemon on the mobile iOS device )  ， sends detailed descriptions of data sent and received during the Touch Setup ， process. ， In the case of the mobile iOS device , this data is encrypted using ， a key exchanged between the two devices. However , it may be possible that ， enough information is leaked in these debug messages ( or other related log ， entries ) that an attacker may recover the session key and thus decrypt the ， entire conversation. ， In the case of the Apple TV unit , the data are generally written to the log ， two or even three times : First , the raw encrypted data as received from the ， mobile device , then the decrypted , yet compressed , plaintext of that data ,  ， and then finally the uncompressed data itself. ， The decompressed data containing configuration information required to ， complete the Touch Setup process is provided as a binary property list ，  ( plist ) . The plist contains , among other data , the following information :  ， AppleID ( iTunes account ) information :  ，  * First Name ，  * Last Name ，  * AppleID ( email address )  ，  * Password ， Local Wi-Fi information :  ，  * SSID ，  * Password",
