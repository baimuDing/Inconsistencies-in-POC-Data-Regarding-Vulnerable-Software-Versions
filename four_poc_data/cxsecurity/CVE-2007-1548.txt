    "text": "vul_name : Web Wiz Forums 8.05 ( MySQL version ) SQL Injection ， vul_cve : CVE-2007-1548 ， vul_poc : There is a vulnerability in MySQL version of Web Wiz Forums , free ASP ， bulletin board system software , enabling SQL injection. The ， vulnerability is in the code used to filter string parameters prior to ， including them in the SQL queries :  ， 'Format SQL Query funtion ， Private Function formatSQLInput ( ByVal strInputEntry )  ， 'Remove malisous charcters from sql ， strInputEntry = Replace ( strInputEntry , \"'\" , \"'\" , 1 , -1 , 1 )  ， strInputEntry = Replace ( strInputEntry , \" , \" , 1 , -1 , 1 )  ， strInputEntry = Replace ( strInputEntry , \"'\" , \"'\" , 1 , -1 , 1 )  ， strInputEntry = Replace ( strInputEntry , \" [ \" , \" [ \" , 1 , -1 , 1 )  ， strInputEntry = Replace ( strInputEntry , \" ] \" , \" ] \" , 1 , -1 , 1 )  ， strInputEntry = Replace ( strInputEntry , \"<\" , \"<\" , 1 , -1 , 1 )  ， strInputEntry = Replace ( strInputEntry , \">\" , \">\" , 1 , -1 , 1 )  ， 'Return ， formatSQLInput = strInputEntry ， End Function ， Assume the user enters a string containing the following sequence of ， characters : \"' ( a backslash , followed by a double quote followed by a ， single quote ) . The first line inside the function above would do ， nothing , the second line would remove the double quote , and after the ， third line the sequence would look like ' ( a backslash followed by ， two single quotes ) . In MySQL the first two characters would be ， interpreted as an escaped single quote and the third character would ， terminate the quotes thus allowing injection of arbitrary SQL code ， placed after it. ， Only the MySQL version of the Web Wiz Forums is vulnerable to this as ， SQL Server and MS Access don't use backslash as an escape character. ， Below I include a small exploit that demonstrates this vulnerability. ， Mar 19th 2007 : Vulnerability discovered ， Mar 20th 2007 : Vendor contacted ， Mar 20th 2007 : Vendor responded ， Mar 20th 2007 : Vendor released fixed version ( 8.05a )  ， Discovered and reported by Ivan Fratric",
