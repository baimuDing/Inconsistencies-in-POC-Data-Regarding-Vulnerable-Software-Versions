The lwp-download ， script is shipped along with the libwww-perl library. ， Unsafe behaviours have been found in lftp and lwp-download handling the ， Content-Disposition header in conjunction with the 'suggested filename' ， functionality. ， Additionally , unsafe behaviours have been found in wget and lwp-download in ， the case of HTTP 3x redirections during file downloading. The two ， applications automatically use the URL's filename portion specified in the ， Location header. ， Implicitly trusting the suggested filenames results in a saved file that ， differs from the expected one according to the URL specified by the user. ， This can be used by an attacker-controlled server to silently write hidden ， and/or initialization files under the user's current directory ，  ( e.g. .login , .bashrc ) . ， The impact of this vulnerability is increased in the case of lftp/lftpget ， as the default configuration allows file to be overwritten without ， prompting the user for confirmation. In the case of lftp the get1 command ， is affected. This command can be invoked directly by the user from lftp's ， command line interface or indirectly by using the lftpget script , packaged ， within the lftp distribution. ， Affected version :  ， lftp <= 4.0.5 ， wget <= 1.12 ， libwww-perl <= 5.834 ， Fixed version :  ， lftp >= 4.0.6 ， wget N/A ， libwww-perl >= 5.835 ， Credit : Vulnerability discovered and reported by Hank Leininger and Solar ， Designer under the Openwall Project , with further analysis by ， Daniele Bianco of oCERT. ， CVE : N/A",
