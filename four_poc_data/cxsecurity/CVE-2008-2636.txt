Any anonymous attacker could crash the http service easily by sending a malformed http request , and needn't any privilege. ， When the device attempts to process the malformed request , it will be possible to corrupt sensitive memory. Although unconfirmed , it may also be possible to modify various configuration settings or execute malicious code. ， After being attacked , Cisco Linksys router can't be accessed remotely by any user. Http service is not recovered and the attacked router can not be managed without a hard reboot. A reboot of router may cause network disconnected. ， Further more , the firewall can still route packets. ， 2. Affected products and versions ， Affected products :  ， Cisco Linksys WRH54G and other devices ，  ( bacause I have no enough other Linksys routers in hand , I can't make sure how many devices this vulnerability can effect. )  ， Affected versions :  ， The lasted Firmware v1.01.03 ， If Need any privilege :  ， No ， 3. ANALYSIS ， A malformed http request can cause the http service crashed. The malformed request is mixed by string ./ and overly charactors. Its format is as follows :  ， 4. EXPLOIT STEPS ， 4.1 Make sure the router is running normally , and the Web server is right. ， 4.2 Open the explorer , type following malformed URL , and press ENTER :  ， agefront_pagefront_pagefront_pagefront_pagefront_pagefront_pagefront_pagefront_pagefront_pagefront_pagefront_pagefront_pagefront_pagefront_pagefront_pagefront_pagefront_pagefront_pagefront_pagefront_pagefront_pagefront_pagefront_pagefront_pagefront_pagefront_pagefront_pagefront_pagefront_pagefront_pagefront_pagefront_pagefront_pagefront_pagefront_pagefront_pagefront_pagefront_pagefront_pagefront_pagefront_pagefront_pagefront_pagefront_pagefront_pagefront_pagefront_pagefront_pagefront_pagefront_page.asp ， 4.3 Check the http service , it can't work. ， Note :  ， 1.
