SSL/TLS Renegotiation Denial of Service Vulnerability ( CVE-2011-1473 )  ， 2. SSLEngine API Information Disclosure Vulnerability ( CVE-2014-0627 )  ， 3. SSL-J JSAFE and JSSE API Information Disclosure Vulnerability ( CVE-2014-0626 )  ， 4. SSLSocket Denial of Service Vulnerability ( CVE-2014-0625 )  ， Details :  ， SSL/TLS Renegotiation Denial of Service Vulnerability ( CVE-2011-1473 )  ， An application that does not properly restrict client-initiated renegotiation within the SSL and TLS protocols could be vulnerable to a denial of service ( CPU consumption ) from remote attackers that perform many renegotiations within a single connection. See for more information. ， SSL-J 6.1.x , 6.0.2 and 5.1.3 are designed to include a patch to determine the number of renegotiations that have been initiated by each SSL/TLS client for each connection , and to help ensure that the server can set a limit on renegotiation requests. ， CVSS v2 Base Score : 5.0 ( AV : N/AC : L/Au : N/C : N/I : N/A : P )  ， SSLEngine API Information Disclosure Vulnerability ( CVE-2014-0627 )  ， When the SSL-J implementation of the SSLEngine API is used , it is possible for Application Data to be sent using the wrap method , after sending the Finished message. However at this time , when the initial handshake is either an abbreviated handshake in server mode or a full handshake in client mode , the handshake is incomplete because the peers Finished message has not been received. This can occur for both the TLS client and server. ， The Application Data that is sent in this manner could be vulnerable to an attacker forcing the use of a weak cipher suite ( if weak cipher suites are enabled ) . ， CVSS v2 Base Score : 4.0 ( AV : N/AC : H/Au : N/C : P/I : P/A : N )  ， SSL-J JSAFE and JSSE API Information Disclosure Vulnerability ( CVE-2014-0626 )  ， Unencrypted and unauthenticated Application Data can be received by the client or server during the TLS handshake. This Application Data is indistinguishable from data received after the completion of the handshake. This applies to the SSL-J JSAFE and JSSE APIs. ， CVSS v2 Base Score : 4.0 ( AV : N/AC : H/Au : N/C : P/I : P/A : N )  ， SSLSocket Denial of Service Vulnerability ( CVE-2014-0625 )  ， If SSLSocket ( from both the JSAFE and JSSE APIs ) is used , Application Data that is received while a handshake is in progress is placed in an internal buffer. This buffer can grow and use up large amounts of memory. ， CVSS v2 Base Score : 4.3 ( AV : N/AC : M/Au : N/C : N/I : N/A : P )  ， Recommendation :  ， RSA recommends that customers on SSL-J 5.1.x or lower upgrade to SSL-J 5.1.3 , 6.0.2 or 6.1.1. ， RSA recommends that customers on SSL-J 6.0 upgrade to SSL-J 6.0.2 or 6.1.1. ， The patch to address CVE-2011-1473 is only applicable on the server side. ， Obtaining Downloads :  ， To request your upgrade of the software , please call your local support telephone number ( contact phone numbers are available at for most expedient service. ， Obtaining Documentation :  ， To obtain RSA documentation , log on to RSA SecurCare Online at and click Products in the top navigation menu.
