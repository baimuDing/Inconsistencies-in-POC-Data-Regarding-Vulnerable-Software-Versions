The attacker can choose ， between the two. ， The BSoD is triggered because the size of the input buffer received by ， the driver is not correctly validated against the size of a static ， buffer , inside the driver module itself , from where the driver transfers ， some data to the allocated buffer. ， The vulnerable function assumes that the size of the input buffer will ， always be less or equal to the static one. ， This leads to memory access violation inside the kernel address space ， when the input buffer is too big , because the vulnerable function will ， attempt to read outside the module itself. ， Further details at :  ， Copyright :  ， Copyright ( c ) Portcullis Computer Security Limited 2014 , All rights ， reserved worldwide.
