    "text": "vul_name : Spring Framework XML External Entity ， vul_cve : CVE-2013-4152 ， vul_poc : Severity : Important ， Vendor : Spring by Pivotal ， Versions Affected :  ， - 3.0.0 to 3.2.3 ( Spring OXM & Spring MVC )  ， - 4.0.0.M1 ( Spring OXM )  ， - 4.0.0.M1-4.0.0.M2 ( Spring MVC )  ， - Earlier unsupported versions may also be affected ， Description :  ， The Spring OXM wrapper did not expose any property for disabling entity resolution when using the JAXB unmarshaller. ， There are four possible source implementations passed to the unmarshaller :  ， - DOMSource ， - StAXSource ， - SAXSource ， - StreamSource ， For a DOMSource , the XML has already been parsed by user code and that code is responsible for protecting against XE. ， For a StAXSource , the XMLStreamReader has already been created by user code and that code is responsible for protecting ， against XE. ， For SAXSource and StreamSource instances , Spring processed external entities by default thereby creating this ， vulnerability. ， The issue was resolved by disabling external entity processing by default and adding an option to enable it for those ， users that need to use this feature when processing XML from a trusted source. ， It was also identified that Spring MVC processed user provided XML with JAXB in combination with a StAX XMLInputFactory ， without disabling external entity resolution. External entity resolution has been disabled in this case. ， Mitigation :  ， Users of affected versions should apply the following mitigation :  ， - Users of 3.x should upgrade to 3.2.4 or later ， - Users of 4.x should upgrade to 4.0.0.RC1 or later once released ， Note the Spring OXM issue is fixed in 4.0.0.M2 ， Credit :  ， These issues were identified by Alvaro Munoz of the HP Enterprise Security Team. ，  ( Spring OXM )  ，  ( Spring MVC )  ， History :  ， 2013-Aug-22 : Initial vulnerability report published.",
