    "text": "vul_name : davfs2 1.4.6/1.4.7 local privilege escalation exploit ， vul_cve : CVE-2013-4362 ， vul_poc : davfs2 1.4.6/1.4.7 local privilege escalation exploit ，  * Bug Description *  :  ， davfs2 is a Linux utility which allows OS users to mount a remote webdav server as a local partition. The bug is well documented at Basically the program \"mount.davfs\" runs as root with setuid and executes some calls to system (  ) which allows to pass environment variables which can alter the system behavior. ，  * Exploit Description *  :  ， calls to system (  ) execute the \"modprobe\" command. An unprivileged , local authenticated user can set the \"MODPROBE_OPTIONS\" environment variable to pass a user controlled path , allowing the load of an arbitrary kernel module. The provided PoC contains a kernel module code which transfers back the execution to a \"/tmp/rootprog\" that can contain user-mode code of choice which will run with root privileges. PLEASE , NOTE THAT THE PROVIDED POC COMES UNARMED , YOU HAVE TO COMPILE THE USER MODE CODE WHICH YOU WANT TO RUN. The exploit has been tested on an Ubuntu-based x86_64 system but should work on other distributions , too. ，  * Conditions for successful exploitation *  :  ， 1-At least one of the module 'fuse' or 'coda' must not be loaded in the kernel. The provided PoC works with coda , which is not loaded by default in most debian-based distributions. ， 2-The user which the attacker is impersonating must be allowed to mount remote webdav servers :  ， eviluser @ host :  ~ /hacks/davfs2 $ cat /etc/group | grep davfs2 ， davfs2 : x : 1001 : eviluser ， 3-davfs2 uses /etc/fstab to define which remote servers can be mounted by users. The user which the attacker is impersonating must be allowed to mount at least one remote Webdav server. If this server uses authentication , the attacker must be aware of the webdav credentials. ， eviluser @ host :  ~ /hacks/davfs2 $ cat /etc/fstab | grep davfs ， /home/eviluser/media/dav davfs noauto , user 0 0 ，  # coda.c ， coda.c - fake coda module that executes a user-mode program",
