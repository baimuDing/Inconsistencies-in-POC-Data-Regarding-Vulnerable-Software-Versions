    "text": "vul_name : Netgear ProSafe Disclosure / Denial Of Service ， vul_cve : CVE-2013-4775 , CVE-2013-4776 ， vul_poc : 1. BACKGROUND ， According to the vendor , Netgear ProSafe is a cost-effective line of smart switches for Small and Medium Businesses ( SMBs ) . The products cover an essential set of network features and easy-to-use web-based management. Power over Ethernet ( PoE ) and Stacking versions are also available. ， 2. SUMMARY ， A range of ProSafe switches are affected by two different vulnerabilities :  ， CVE-2013-4775 : Unauthenticated startup-config disclosure. ， CVE-2013-4776 : Denial of Service vulnerability. ， 3. AFFECTED PRODUCTS AND SOFTWARE ， CVE-2013-4775 ， GS724Tv3 and GS716Tv2 - firmware 5.4.1.13 ， GS724Tv3 and GS716Tv2 - firmware 5.4.1.10 ， GS748Tv4 - firmware 5.4.1.14 ， GS510TP - firmware 5.4.0.6 ， GS752TPS and GS728TPS - firmware 5.3.0.17 ， GS728TS and GS725TS - firmware 5.3.0.17 ， GS752TXS and GS728TXS - firmware 6.1.0.12 ， CVE-2013-4776 ， GS724Tv3 and GS716Tv2 - firmware 5.4.1.13 ， GS724Tv3 and GS716Tv2 - firmware 5.4.1.10 ， GS748Tv4 - firmware 5.4.1.14 ， GS510TP - firmware 5.0.4.4 ， 4. VULNERABILITIES ， The list below describes the vulnerabilities discovered in the affected software. ， 4.1 CVE-2013-4775 : Unauthenticated startup-config disclosure ， The web management application fails to restrict URL access to different application areas. ， Remote , unauthenticated attackers could exploit this issue to download the devices startup-config ,  ， which contains administrator credentials in encrypted form. ，  [ Proof of Concept ]  ， The vulnerability can be exploited with a simple HTTP ( GET ) request. ， Open a browser and visit ， 4.2 CVE-2013-4776 : Denial of Service vulnerability ， The affected products are prone to a Denial of Service vulnerability. Remote , unauthenticated ， attackers could exploit this issue to cause a switch reboot or crash , resulting in a loss of ， network connectivity for all devices connected to the switch. ，  [ Proof of Concept ]  ， The vulnerability can be exploited with a simple HTTP ( GET ) request. ， Open a browser and visit ， Implementation of a Proof of Concept for both vulnerabilities can be found here :  ， 5. REMEDIATION ， No firmware updates or fixes have been released yet. ， As a mitigation , the vendor recommends configuring a separate management VLAN and configure ， access control via Security : Access : Access Control or Security : ACL : Advanced : IP Extended Rules. ， 6.
