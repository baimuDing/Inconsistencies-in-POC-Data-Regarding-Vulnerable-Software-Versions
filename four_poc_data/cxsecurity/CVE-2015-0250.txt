[ 1 ]  ， Batik offers several classes for svg to png/jpg conversion , which suffer from a XML External Entity Injection due to the evaluation of external entities within the given svg file. If an application offers the possibility to upload a svg file an attacker can put in a malicious formed file and retrieve sensitive information such as the content of files of the respective server. The type of file that can be retrieved depends on the user context in which the application is running. ， Further information about the vulnerability can be seen here [ 2 ] and here [ 3 ] . ， Exploitation Technique :  ， Remote ， Severity Level :  ， Medium ， CVSS Base Score ， 6.4 ( AV : N / AC : L / Au : N / C : P / I : N / A : P )  ， CVE-ID ， CVE-2015-0250 ， Impact ， Files lying on the filesystem of the server which uses batik can ， be revealed to arbitrary users who send maliciously formed svg ， files. The file types that can be shown depend on the user context ， in which the exploitable application is running. If the user is 'root' ， a full compromise of the server-including confidential or sensitive ， files-would be possible. ， XE can also be used to attack the availability of the server ， via denial of service as the references within a xml document ， can trivially trigger an amplification attack. ， Proof of Concept ， A fully documented proof of concept can be downloaded here :  [ 4 ]  ， Mitigation ， Upgrade to Batik 1.8+ ， Affected Versions ， All versions ， 1.0 - 1.7 ( current )  ， Timeline ， 2015-01-22 : Apache informed via email - no response ， 2015-02-08 : Remainder sent via email ， 2015-02-10 : Vulnerability confirmed and fix has been tested and confirmed to work ， 2015-03-17 : Release of a fixed version and public dislocure ， Credits ， Timo Schmid <tschmid (  ) ernw de> ，  [ 1 ]  ，  [ 2 ]  ，  [ 3 ]  ，  [ 4 ]  ， Disclaimer ， The information herein contained may change without notice.
