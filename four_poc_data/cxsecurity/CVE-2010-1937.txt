    "text": "vul_name : SBLIM SFCBs up to 1.3.7 pre-auth remote integer and heap overflow ， vul_cve : CVE-2010-1937 , CVE-2010-2054 ， vul_poc :  [ = ] Product overview ， SBLIM SFCB is an Open Source implementation of a WBEM CIM broker. WBEM ， is a set of technologies aimed to monitor and administer ( larges ) pools ， of computing ressources , applications , hardware. It's used by computers ， management tools like HP Systems Insight Manager , VMware vSphere or IBM ， Director. SFCB usually listens on TCP ports 5988 ( HTTP ) or 5989 ( HTTPS )  ， and is used in many Linux distributions and some VMware / Dell products. ，  [ = ] Vulnerabilities ，  * CVE-2010-1937 ( SFCB bug # 3001896 )  : pre-auth remote heap overflow ， using a forged Content-Length header ， When parsing a HTTP request , SFCB will use any positive Content-Length ， value to allocate a buffer. Then , memcpy tries to copy the user-provided ， POST data in this buffer. By sending a small value in the Content-Length ， header and more data in the POST body , it's possible to overflow the ， previously allocated heap buffer. ， Vulnerable versions : up to 1.3.7 ，  * CVE-2010-2054 ( SFCB bug # 3001915 )  : pre-auth remote integer overflow ， using a forged Content-Length header ， If the configuration option \"httpMaxContentLength\" is explicitly set to ， 0 , SFCB will only check that the Content-Length value is positive and ， lower than UINT_MAX and use it ( adding 8 ) to allocate a buffer. Then ,  ， memcpy tries to copy the user-provided POST data in this buffer. By ， sending a value between UINT_MAX-7 and UINT_MAX-1 , it is possible to ， overflow a buffer of size 1 to 7. ， Vulnerable versions : from 1.3.4 to 1.3.7 ，  [ = ] Note about VMware products ， VMware ESXi 3.5 , ESXi 4 and ESX 4 are running by default a modified ， version of SFCB ( v1.3.3 in ESX 4 ) . However they were tested as non ， vulnerable :  ， - CVE-2010-1937 has been silently patched in WMware products ， - CVE-2010-2054 doesn't affect versions lower than 1.3.4 ，  [ = ] Mitigating factors ， None :  ， - SSL authentication isn't used by SFCB ， - bugs are triggered before any HTTP-layer credential check ， - POST and M-POST are default methods used by WBEM ，  [ = ] Vectors ， These vulnerabilities can be triggered by default on port TCP/5988 ，  ( HTTTP ) or TCP/5989 ( HTTPS )  , using POST or M-POST requests. ，  [ = ] Solution ， Upgrade to version 1.3.8 ，  [ = ] Links ， SBLIM SFCB :  ， WBEM :  ， CVE-2010-1937 :  ， CVE-2010-2054 :  ， SFCB bug # 3001896 :  ， SFCB bug # 3001915 :  ， Regards ,  ， Nicolas Grgoire / Agarri",
