    "text": "vul_name : ActionScript 3 in Adobe Flash Player 9.0.47.0 socket handling allows port probing ， vul_cve : CVE-2007-4324 ， vul_poc : Design flaw in AS3 socket handling allows port probing ，  # Summary ， Due to a design flaw in ActionScript 3 socket handling , compiled ， Flash movies are able to scan for open TCP ports on any host ， reachable from the host running the SWF , bypassing the Flash Player ， Security Sandbox Model and without the need to rebind DNS. ，  # Technical background ， In AS3 Adobe introduced a new socket-related event called ， SecurityErrorEvent. This event is always thrown when a Flash Player ， tries to connect to a socket that it is not allowed to connect to by ， policy. ， The problem with the SecurityErrorEvent is that it's thrown ， immediately when a Flash Player tries to connect to a closed TCP ， port. If a service is listening on that port the Flash Player writes ， the string \"<policy-file-request/>\" and waits for response from the ， service. Nearly no TCP-service will respond to this request. ， We can assume the following : When trying to connect to a socket that ， the SWF is not allowed to and it doesn't get a SecurityErrorEvent ， within 2 seconds the port is most likely open. ， A new Flash player instance is used for every probed port because the ， Flash Player sends only one policy-file request per player per host ， per port. ，  # Tested platforms ， Works on :  ，  * Windows XP SP2 : Internet Explorer 6 / Flash Player 9.0.47.0 ，  * Windows XP SP2 : Firefox 2.0.0.5 / Flash Player 9.0.47.0 ，  * Windows XP SP2 : IE 7.0.5730.11 Flash Player 9.0.47.0 ，  * Ubuntu Edgy : Firefox 2.0.0.5 / Flash Player 9.0.47.0 ，  * Mac OSX 10.4.10 : Safari 2.0.4 / Flash Player 9.0.47.0 ，  * Mac OSX 10.4.10 : Safari 3.0.2 / Flash Player 9.0.47.0 ，  * Mac OSX 10.4.10 : Firefox 2.0.0.6 / Flash Player 9.0.47.0 ，  * Solaris 10 i86 : Firefox 2.0.0.3 / Flash Player 9.0.47.0 ， Doesn't work as expected on :  ，  * Mac OSX 10.4.10 : Opera 9.22 / Flash Player 9.0.47.0 ，  # Known limitations ，  * The Scanner does not work on services that close the TCP- ， Connection immediately after they receive Bytes that they don`t ， \"understand\". The port is reported as closed because the ， SecurityErrorEvent is thrown when the TCP-Connection is closed. ，  * The Scanner does not always work as expected when scanning ， hosts located in the internet ( e.g. google.com ) . This maybe happens ， due to stateful inspection firewalls that close the connections or ， long TCP-response times.",
