CSharp critical classes/functions calls are however not allowed due to security reasons. ， CxQL can be executed on two locations :  ， - Remotely on Checkmarx server if the analyzed source code is uploaded via the web interface ,  ， - Or locally in CxAudit ( a thick client connected to the enterprise Checkmarx server )  , installed on an auditor's code review workstation. ， We identified a possibility of bypass that would allow execution of arbitrary and unauthorized CSharp code in those contexts , and thus compromise the security of the machine on which the code is executed , either a Checkmarx server or an auditor's workstation. ， The following scenarios describe attacks where this bypass is possible :  ， - An auditor ( a specific user allowed to execute his own CxQL queries ) having only access to the Citrix interface of CxAudit can take control of the workstation ,  ， - A Checkmarx administrator having only access to Checkmarx web interface can take control of the Checkmarx enterprise server , and CxAudit workstations by injecting malicious code into default queries. ， Technical details ， 1. Etablishing network connection ， The following code attempts to make a network connection and return the content in the debug panel :  ， { ， System.Net.WebRequest request = System.Net.WebRequest.Create ( \" ， System.Net.WebResponse response = request.GetResponse (  )  ;  ， CxDebug ( new System.IO.StreamReader ( response.GetResponseStream (  ) .ReadToEnd (  )  ;  ， } ， catch ( Exception e )  ， { ， CxDebug ( e.Message )  ;  ， } ， However , the following error message is returned :  ， Request for the permission of type 'System.Net.WebPermission , System , Version=2.0.0.0 , Culture=neutral , PublicKeyToken=xx' failed.",
