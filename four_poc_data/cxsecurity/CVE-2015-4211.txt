This , along with the name change makes it clear you only want to execute the VPN Downloader application. However the code doesnt limit the location of the executable file , so one exploitation vector is DLL planting. The downloader loads a lot of DLLs from the executable directory first , so by copying the vpndownloader.exe file from Program Files to a temporary directory and dropping an appropriately named DLL you can get code execution as SYSTEM. One such DLL is dbghelp.dll which is loaded explicitly by the downloader using LoadLibrary , but there are many more. ， Even if by luck the executable wasnt vulnerable to DLL planting theres many other potential issues , for example even though a lock is made on the executable file during signature verification its possible to use symbolic links to exploit this as a race condition and switch the executable file after verification has completed. Theres many other possibilities as well. Id recommend that if youre really only supposed to be executing vpndownloader you only execute it from the secure program files directory which would eliminate this issue. ， This was based on work previous done by Kostya Kortchinsky.",
