One of the features it includes is the ability to check comments for spam and present the spammy comments for deletion. ， The plugin uses the column_ct_comment function in /lib/Cleantalk/ApbctWP/FindSpam/ListTable/Comments.php to display the list of spam comments , and in doing so generates links to approve , trash , or mark comments as spam using the value supplied in $ _REQUEST [ page ] . ， Thanks to a quirk of how WordPress processes the page parameter and the default PHP request order , it is possible to use this parameter to perform a reflected cross-site scripting attack , which is almost identical to a vulnerability we recently covered (  ) . ， The vulnerability can be used to execute JavaScript in the browser of a logged-in administrator , for instance , by tricking them into visiting a self-submitting form that sends a POST request to the site at wp-admin/edit-comments.php?page=ct_check_spam , with the $ _POST [ page ] parameter set to malicious JavaScript. ， As with any Cross-Site Scripting vulnerability , executing JavaScript in an administrators session can be used to take over a site by adding a new malicious administrator or injecting a backdoor , among other potential methods. ， Description : Reflected Cross-Site Scripting ， Affected Plugin : Spam protection , AntiSpam , FireWall by CleanTalk ， Plugin Slug : cleantalk-spam-protect ， Plugin Developer : CleanTalk ， Affected Versions : <= 5.173 ， CVE ID : CVE-2022-28222 ， CVSS Score : 6.1 ( Medium )  ， CVSS Vector : CVSS : 3.1/AV : N/AC : L/PR : N/UI : R/S : C/C : L/I : L/A : N ， Researcher/s : Ramuel Gall ， Fully Patched Version : 5.174.1 ， Similar to the spam comment functionality , CleanTalk also includes a feature that checks for spammy users and presents them in a similar table for review and deletion. ， In this case the vulnerable function is column_ct_username in /lib/Cleantalk/ApbctWP/FindSpam/ListTable/Users.php , which uses the value of $ _REQUEST [ page ] to generate links to delete potentially spammy users. ， As with the spam comment vulnerability , if an administrator can be tricked into performing an action , it is possible to use JavaScript running in their browser to take over a site. ， Timeline ， February 15 , 2022 The Wordfence Threat Intelligence team finishes our investigation and verifies that the Wordfence firewalls built-in protection is sufficient to block exploit attempts.
