    "text": "vul_name : linux kernel 2.6.36.1 TIPC security issues ， vul_cve : CVE-2010-3859 ， vul_poc :  ， The tipc_msg_build (  ) function in net/tipc/msg.c is written in such a way ， as to create a highly exploitable kernel heap overflow that would allow ， a local user to escalate privileges to root by issuing maliciously ， crafted sendmsg (  ) calls. At a minimum , the following issues should be ， fixed :  ， 1. The tipc_msg_calc_data_size (  ) function is almost totally broken. It ， sums together size_t values ( iov_lens )  , but returns an integer. Two ， things can go wrong - the total value can wrap around , or on 64-bit ， platforms , iov_len values greater than UINT_MAX will be truncated. ， 2. The comparison of dsz to TIPC_MAX_USER_MSG_SIZE is signed , so ， negative ( large unsigned ) values will pass this check. ， 3. The comparison of sz to max_size is also signed. ， As a result of these issues , it's possible to cause the allocation of a ， small heap buffer and the subsequent copying of a carefully controlled ， larger amount of data into that buffer. ， I haven't found a Linux distribution that defines a module alias for ， TIPC ( even though most compile it as a module )  , so an administrator will ， have had to explicitly load the TIPC module for a system to be ， vulnerable. ， -Dan",
