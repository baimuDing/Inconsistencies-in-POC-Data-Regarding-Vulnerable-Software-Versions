    "text": "vul_name : DOS issue in Astaro Version 7 packet filter reporting ， vul_cve : CVE-2007-4243 , CVE-2007-4242 ， vul_poc : I have details about the DOS issue on my blog with links to the Astaro ， forums. ， Version affected :  ， ALL Version 7 systems. ， This is easily reproducible. Just setup a BT client behind the astaro ， and do not setup a packetfilter and NAT rule for the BT traffic. This ， way all the incoming return traffic is blocked. Go download something ， like the Centos DVD torrent. Some machine ( like mine ) are easy to bring ， down. Others take a time longer. The pfilter-repoter.pl file will peg ， the cpu for an exorbitant amount of time. Before 7.006 it would take ， the machine offline. 7.006 partially mitigates in my testing but not fully. ， For the pop3 Proxy if you set an attachment size limit , any attachments ， over that size are NOT scanned and allowed to pass through instead of ， being quarantined. ， These are not critical events but are issues nonetheless. ， My \"Foundation\" verse :  ， Isa 54 : 17 No weapon that is formed against thee shall prosper ; and ， every tongue that shall rise against thee in judgment thou shalt ， condemn. This is the heritage of the servants of the LORD , and their ， righteousness is of me , saith the LORD. ， - carpe ductum - \"Grab the tape\" ， CDTT ( Certified Duct Tape Technician )  ， Linux user # 322099 ， Machines :  ， 206822 ， 256638 ， 276825",
