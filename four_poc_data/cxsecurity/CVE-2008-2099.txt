Summary :  ， Several critical security vulnerabilities have been addressed ， in the newest releases of VMware's hosted product line. ， 2. Relevant releases :  ， VMware Workstation 6.0.3 and earlier ,  ， VMware Player 2.0.3 and earlier ,  ， VMware ACE 2.0.3 and earlier ,  ， VMware Fusion 1.1.1 and earlier ， NOTES : Users of VMware hosted products VMware Workstation 5.x ,  ， VMware Player 1.x , and VMware ACE 1.x should note that ， although they are not vulnerable to these issue , they ， will reach their end of general support on 2008-11-09. ， Customers should plan to upgrade to the latest version ， of their respective products. ， 3. Problem description :  ， a. VMware HGFS File System Heap Overflow ， The VMware Host Guest File System ( HGFS ) shared folders feature allows ， users to transfer data between a guest operating system and the ， non-virtualized host operating system that contains it. ， A heap buffer overflow condition is present in VMware HGFS. Exploitation ， of this flaw might allow an unprivileged guest process to execute code ， in the context of the vmx process on the host. ， In order to exploit this vulnerability , the VMware system must have ， at least one folder shared. Two things must happen for a folder to ， be shared. 1 ) Shared folders must be enabled , and 2 ) a folder must ， be selected from the host system to be shared. No folders are shared ， by default in any version of our products , which means this ， vulnerability is not exploitable by default. Workstation 6.x ,  ， Player 2.x , and ACE 2.x have shared folders disabled by default. ， VMware Server , ESX and ESXi do not provide the shared folders feature. ， Because there is no back-end for the HGFS protocol on the virtualization ， host , these products are architecturally immune to this issue. ， This issue might not be exploitable on host operating systems which ， have implemented heap protection. ， VMware would like to thank Andrew Honig of the Department of ， Defense for reporting this issue. ， The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project ( cve.mitre.org )  ， has assigned the name CVE-2008-2098 to this issue. ， VMware Product Running Replace with/ ， Product Version on Apply Patch ， Workstation 6.x Windows 6.0.4 build 93057 ， Workstation 6.x Linux 6.0.4 build 93057 ， Workstation 5.x Windows not affected ， Workstation 5.x Linux not affected ， Player 2.x Windows 2.0.4 build 93057 ， Player 2.x Linux 2.0.4 build 93057 ， Player 1.x Windows not affected ， Player 1.x Linux not affected ， ACE 2.x Windows 2.0.2 build 93057 ， ACE 1.x Windows not affected ， Server 1.x Windows not affected ， Server 1.x Linux not affected ， Fusion 1.x Mac OS/X 1.1.2 build 87978 or later ， b. Windows based VMCI arbitrary code execution vulnerability ， VMCI was introduced in VMware Workstation 6.0 , VMware Player 2.0 ,  ， and VMware ACE 2.0. It is an experimental , optional feature ， that allows virtual machines to communicate with one another. ， With VMCI enabled a guest may execute arbitrary code in the context ， of the vmx process on the host. This is a compiler dependent ， vulnerability and only affects systems running on windows hosts. ， VMware would like to thank Andrew Honig of the Department of ， Defense for reporting this issue. ， The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project ( cve.mitre.org )  ， has assigned the name CVE-2008-2099 to this issues. ， VMware Product Running Replace with/ ， Product Version on Apply patch ， Workstation 6.x Windows 6.0.4 build 93057 ， Workstation 6.x Linux not affected ， Workstation 5.x Windows not affected ， Workstation 5.x Linux not affected ， Player 2.x Windows 2.0.4 build 93057 ， Player 2.x Linux not affected ， Player 1.x Windows not affected ， Player 1.x Linux not affected ， ACE 2.x Windows 2.0.2 build 93057 ， ACE 1.x Windows not affected ， Server 1.x Windows not affected ， Server 1.x Linux not affected ， Fusion 1.x Mac OS/X not affected",
