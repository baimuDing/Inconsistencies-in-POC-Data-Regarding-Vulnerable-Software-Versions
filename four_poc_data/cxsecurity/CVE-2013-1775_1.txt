    "text": "vul_name : sudo authentication bypass when clock is reset ， vul_cve : CVE-2013-1775 ， vul_poc : Sudo 1.8.6p7 and 1.7.10p7 are now available which include a fix for the following bug :  ， Sudo authentication bypass when clock is reset ， Summary :  ， When a user successfully authenticates with sudo , a time stamp ， file is updated to allow that user to continue running sudo ， without requiring a password for a preset time period ( five ， minutes by default ) . The user's time stamp file can be reset ， using \"sudo -k\" or removed altogether via \"sudo -K\". ， A user who has sudo access and is able to control the local ， clock ( common in desktop environments ) can run a command via ， sudo without authenticating as long as they have previously ， authenticated themselves at least once by running \"sudo -k\" and ， then setting the clock to the epoch ( 1970-01-01 01 : 00 : 00 ) . ， The vulnerability does not permit a user to run commands other ， than those allowed by the sudoers policy. ， Sudo versions affected :  ， Sudo 1.6.0 through 1.7.10p7 and sudo 1.8.0 through 1.8.6p7. ， Details :  ， By default , sudo displays a lecture when the user's time stamp ， file is not present. In sudo 1.6 , the -k option was changed ， to reset the time stamp file to the epoch rather than remove ， it to prevent the lecture from being displayed the next time ， sudo was run. No special case was added for handling a time ， stamp file set to the epoch since the clock should never ， legitimately be set to that value. ， However , there are two common ways for the clock to be reset ， to the epoch. The first way is when the clock is reset due to ， a fully drained battery on some systems. The other way is by ， a user logged in to a desktop environment that allows changes ， to the date and time. ， As long as the user has successfully run sudo before , they are ， able to run \"sudo -k\" to reset the time stamp file.
