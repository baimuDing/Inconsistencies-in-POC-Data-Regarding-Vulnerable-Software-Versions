A ， skin file is a bundle of graphics and a .ini file , stored together in ， ZIP format. DUNZIP32.DLL , which is included with RealPlayer , is used to ， extract the contents of the skin file. When RealPlayer processes a zip ， file , it will allocate the field of the file but when it is copied it ， will rely on real unzip content to copy. So an attacker can zip one file ， that has hostile data and create a rjs file. We can change the file ， length field of rjs file so when it process this zip file it will cause ， a heap overflow. ， Protection :  ， Retina Network Security Scanner has been updated to identify this ， vulnerability. ， Vendor Status :  ， RealNetworks has released a patch for this vulnerability.
