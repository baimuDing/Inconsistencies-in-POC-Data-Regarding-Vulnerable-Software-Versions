For further product information on the TippingPoint IPS :  ， - Vulnerability Details :  ， This vulnerability allows attackers to execute arbitrary code on ， vulnerable installations of Sun Microsystems Java Virtual Machine ，  ( JVM ) . User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in ， that the target must visit a malicious website. ， The specific flaw exists during the parsing of GIF image components. ， When the image width in an image block of a valid GIF file is set to 0 ,  ， the Java runtime will allocate the specified size but subsequently copy ， all data to the under allocated memory chunk. The overflow results in ， the corruption of multiple pointers , at least one of which is later ， dereferenced and can therefore result in execution of arbitrary code.",
