The cause ， is that the pam_lsass library uses SetPassword logic when ， detecting that the uid is 0 therefore not requiring ， that the intruder validate against the expired password ， before being allowed to specify a new password. ， All Likewise Open users are encouraged to upgrade to ， the latest released packages for their version or to ， to employ the stated workaround until such a time when ， an upgrade may be performed. ， This defect was first reported by Matt Weatherford from ， the University of Washington. Our thanks to Matt for ， helping improve Likewise Open. ， _ ， Workaround :  ， Explicitly disabling the MACHINE\\Administrator ( or any ， other lsassd local-provider accounts not in use ) will ， prevent unauthorized access. This may be done by running ， the following command as the local superuser. Replace ， <MACHINE> with the hostname of the local system ，  $ lw-mod-user -disable-user \"<MACHINE>\\Administrator\" ， You may verify that the account is disabled by running the ， lw-find-user-by-name command ，  $ lw-find-user-by-name -level 2 \"MACHINE\\Administrator\" ， . ， Account disabled ( or locked )  : TRUE ， _ ， Updated Packages :  ， New packages for both Likewise Open 5.4 and Likewise Open ， 6.0 have been made available from ， _ ， Likewise Security Team security ( at ) likewise ( dot ) com [ email concealed ]  ， _",
