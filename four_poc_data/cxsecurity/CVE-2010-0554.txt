NTRIP ， is a protocol within RTCM to provide GNSS information via Internet.\" ， (from the vendor's homepage) ， More Details ， The authentication method required for requesting the path \"/admin.htm\" ， is HTTP Digest. The following flaws were identified during a penetration ， test: ， a) Even though the server states that HTTP Digest is required for ， authentication, a client can use HTTP Basic Authentication successfully. ， b) The server software generates the nonce used for HTTP Digest ， authentication only once when the server is started. This same nonce is ， then used for all authentication until the server is restarted. This ， makes the authentication prone to replay attacks. The nonce is the ， base64-encoded concatenation of the date and time the server was started ， and a 16 byte hex string. ， c) The server's response to a failed authentication request contains 32 ， bytes of data from the service's memory. This data sometimes contains ， parts of other users' HTTP requests. Which portion of memory is ， disclosed depends on the length of the HTTP request sent. By changing ， the length of e.g. any request header, attackers might also retrieve the ， authentication headers sent by other users. ， Workaround ， None ， Fix ， Update GNCASTER to version 1.4.0.8. ， Security Risk ， Attackers that can record a user's login communication with the server ， can replay this authentication information to gain access to the admin ， interface. Attackers might also be able to gather other users' ， authentication headers from portions of memory disclosed by the server. ， However, the admin interface currently does not seem to offer much ， functionality. Therefore the risk of these vulnerabilities is regarded ， as low. ， History ， 2009-07-07 Vulnerability identified during a penetration test ， 2009-07-14 Meeting with customer ， 2009-12-01 Vendor releases fixed version ， 2010-01-27 Advisory released ， RedTeam Pentesting GmbH ， RedTeam Pentesting offers individual penetration tests, short pentests, ， performed by a team of specialised IT-security experts.
