    "text": "vul_name : suexec mod_ruid2 before 0.9.8 privilege escalation ， vul_cve : CVE-2013-1889 ， vul_poc : mod_ruid2 is a suexec style module for apache 2.0 , 2.2 and 2.4 , based on ， mod_ruid and mod_suid2 that allows the Apache webserver to run under the ， UID and GID of the user account that controls a virtualhost. It also ， includes functionality to chroot Apache into the virtualhost document ， root prior to processing HTTP requests. ， After processing each request , mod_ruid2 returns to its initial starting ， state. For uid/gid changes this is done using linux capabilities. For ， chroot , this is done by following a file descriptor that leads outside ， of the chroot. ， In versions of mod_ruid2 before 0.9.8 , the filedescriptor used to break ， out of the chroot is inherited by all Apache subprocesses. This allows ， CGI scripts to also to break out of the chroot by performing a fchdir (  )  ， across the inherited file descriptor.",
