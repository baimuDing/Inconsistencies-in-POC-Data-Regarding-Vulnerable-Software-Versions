Therefore , attacker or malware could load own FAS or DLL?file ， when AutoCAD user opened DWG file on a directory stored these DLL or FAS file. ， The vendor , Autodesk , Inc , fixed these vulnerabilities in AutoCAD 2014. ， These vulnerabilities were assigned CVE-2014-0818 and CVE-2014-0819. ， CVE-2014-0818/JVN # 33382534 ， CVE-2014-0819/JVN # 43254599 ， Background ， On June 2012 , ESET posted blog entry (  * 1 ) about ACAD/Medre.A , a worm written in ， AutoLISP. The blog entry explained the malware abused automatic loading of ， AutoLISP routines. I interested in search path of AutoCAD and consulted AutoCAD ， official document. And , I confirmed that AutoCAD search AutoLisp code firstly ， on current working directory (  * 2 ) if AutoLisp code was loaded by only filename. ， As a result , I wrote a Proof of Concept based the ESET blog entry and reported ， malware issue as untrusted search path vulnerability to IPA (  * 3 ) . ，  (  * 1 )  :  ，  (  * 2 )  :  ( Japanese )  ，  (  * 3 )  : INFORMATION-TECHNOLOGY PROMOTION AGENCY , JAPAN ， Procedure for reproducing issue ， I confirmed this procedure on AutoCAD 2013 , version G.55.0.0. ，  ( 1 ) Launch AutoCAD 2013 and saved empty dimensional design data as ， Drawing1.dwg. Then , store the Drawing1.dwg with PoC code ,  ， Acad.fas (  * 4 )  , on C : \\exploit. ，  ( 2 ) After Process Monitor (  * 5 ) is launched , open Drawing1.dwg by double-click. ，  ( 3 ) Launched AutoCAD 2013 , and launched calc.exe at same time. ， Then , look up Process Monitor and you can confirm that Acad.fas is loaded ， on current working directory stored Drawing1.dwg. ， And , look up [ Event Properties ] - [ Stack ] of Process Monitor and ， you can see that accore.dll load Acad.fas. ，  (  * 4 )  : PoC code is not explained this advisory. Please contact to me ，  (  * 5 )  :  ， Timeline ， Jul 3 , 2012 I reported the vulnerability to IPA by email , and ， IPA responded that we received the vulnerability report. ， Aug 6 , 2012 IPA informed me that we confirmed the report and submitted ， to vendor , Autodesk , Inc , by email. ， mid-Aug 2012 The vendor released AudoCAD 2013 Service Pack 1 ( SP1 )  ， that provided new security feature ; see ， Apr 4 , 2013 I inquired at IPA whether the vunlerability was fixed ， or not by email. ， Apr 18 , 2013 IPA answered to me that the vendor released SP1 and ， would fix the vulnerability in the future by email. ， May 11 , 2013 I inquired at IPA whether CVE-2014-0818 was fixed , and ， CVE-2014-0819 was not fixed by email. ， May 22 , 2013 IPA answered to me that CVE-2014-0818 and CVE-2014-0819 ， were not fixed , and would be fixed in the future by email. ， Aug 22 , 2013 I inquired at IPA whether the vulnerability and CVE-2013-3665 ， were different or not by email. ， Sep 4 , 2013 IPA responded to me that we were waiting for reply from ， vendor by email. ， mid-Sep 2013 IPA answered to me that the vulnerability and CVE-2013-3665 ， were different by email. ， Feb 21 , 2014 The vendor fixed CVE-2014-0818 and CVE-2014-0819 , and ， IPA puslished the advisories : JVN # 33382534 and JVN # 43254599. ，  * Hatena Diary ( my blog post in Japanse )  ，  * Autodesk , Inc ，  * Vulnerability related to CVE-2014-0818",
