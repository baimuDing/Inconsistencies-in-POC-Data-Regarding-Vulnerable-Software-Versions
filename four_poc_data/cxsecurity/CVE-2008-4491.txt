I comment on the flaw on my blog: ， An up to date version of the advisory can be found: ， The advisory was first published on EnableSecurity Newsletter. If ， you'd like to subscribe then send an email to ， newsletter (at) enablesecurity (dot) com [email concealed] ， . ， Apple's Mail.app stores your S/MIME encrypted emails in clear text ， Date published: 2008-10-03 ， Affected version: 3.5 (929.4/929.2) ， Unaffected version: Unknown ， Summary: ， Apple Mail.app does not store S/MIME encrypted emails securely in the ， Drafts directory on server. ， Impact: ， The assumption that the server does not have access to the email ， content is violated. ， Description: ， Apple's Mail.app is the default email application that comes with Mac ， OS X machines. It supports S/MIME as standard for encryption and ， authentication of emails. However by default Mail.app also has an ， option called \"Store draft messages on the server\" when you are making ， use of an IMAP or Exchange server. ， The assumption when making use of S/MIME is that no one except you and ， the recipient of the email can view your encrypted email - end to end ， encryption. Emails are stored in encrypted form on the server and ， therefore should not be read by anyone having access to the email ， server, thus preventing Man in the Mirity ， attacks. What the \"Store draft messages on the server\" option does is ， store a clear text version of the email, until the email is sent. ， The problem with this option is that it defies the assumption that the ， email is encrypted on the server. This can therefore lead to a false ， sense of security and information leakage, which is exactly what ， people making use of S/MIME want to prevent."
