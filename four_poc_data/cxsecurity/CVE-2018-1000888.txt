When extract (  ) is called without a specific prefix path , we can trigger phar induced unserialization by crafting a tar file with `phar : / [ path_to_malicious_phar_file ] ` as path name. Object injection can be used to trigger destructor/wakeup method in the loaded PHP classes , e.g. the Archive_Tar class itself. With Archive_Tar itself , we can trigger arbitrary file deletion because ` @ unlink (  $ this->_temp_tarname ) ` will be called in the destructor method. If another class with useful gadget is loaded , remote code execution may be possible.",
