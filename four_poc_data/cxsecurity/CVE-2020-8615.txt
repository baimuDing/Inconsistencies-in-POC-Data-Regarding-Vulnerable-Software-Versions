Description ，  # The Tutor LMS WordPress plugin is a feature-packed plugin that enables users to create and sell courses. ，  # An attacker can use CSRF to register themselves as an instructor or block other legit instructors. ，  # Consequently , if the option to create courses without admin approval is enabled on the plugins settings ，  # page , the attacker will be able to create courses directly as well. All WordPress websites ，  # using Tutor LMS version 1.5.2 and below are affected. ，  # 2. Proof of Concept ，  # As the requests for the approval and blocking of instructors are sent using the GET method , the CSRF ，  # attack to approve an attacker-controlled instructor account can be performed by having the admin ，  # visit directly ,  ，  # after retrieving the instructor ID during the registration process. An approved instructor can also be blocked ，  # by directing the admin to visit ，  # CSRF attack can also be performed on the form present at ，  # in order to have the admin add an instructor account for the attacker , thus bypassing the requirement for approval. ，  # This can be done by tricking the admin to submit the below-given web form as a POST request. For example , if the web form is ，  # hosted on an attacker-controlled domain an admin who is logged in at can ，  # be tricked into visiting the link and triggering the request to add an instructor.",
