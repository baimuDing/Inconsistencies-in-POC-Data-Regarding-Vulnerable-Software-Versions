This meant that files were created with ， KernelMode permissions , thereby bypassing any security checks that would otherwise ， prevent a normal user from being able to create files in directories ， they don't have permissions to create files in. ， This module abuses this vulnerability to perform a DLL hijacking attack against the ， Microsoft Storage Spaces SMP service , which grants the attacker code execution as the ， NETWORK SERVICE user. Users are strongly encouraged to set the PAYLOAD option to one ， of the Meterpreter payloads , as doing so will allow them to subsequently escalate their ， new session from NETWORK SERVICE to SYSTEM by using Meterpreter's \"getsystem\" command ， to perform RPCSS Named Pipe Impersonation and impersonate the SYSTEM user. ， }",
