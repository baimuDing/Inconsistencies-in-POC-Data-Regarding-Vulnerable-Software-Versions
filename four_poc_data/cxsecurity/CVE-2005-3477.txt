The core element of my Proof ， of Concept is the ， lately found Gif-bug in IE ( Originally found by Sven Vetsch ) . ， For some reason IE renders malformed embedded content files ( like ， gif , jpg , wav , and so on. )  ， as HTML when they are accessed directly e.g. ， through the <img> ， tag ) . ， If we create an HTML file and rename its extention to .GIF ( or other ， embedded content file ， extention )  , and upload it to an HTTP server ( it dosn't work locally for some ， reason )  , when we ， will navigate to the HTML code will be executed ， instead of showing ， that the image is invalid. ， So , if we could upload such a file to a server that allows image upload we ， could actually upload ， HTML code instead ( Inside the image file ) . If the victim will be lured to ， navigate to this ， specially crafted image in IE , arbitary HTML code could be executed in the ， servers security zone ,  ， e.g. we could steall the users cookie , for example. ， However it is not that simple with systems ( like phpBB ) that verify the ， image file before it ， is uploaded to the server. If we try to upload our previosly made ， gif file the system will complain about incorrect image size - that's ， because our image is invalid. ， The verification system chechs the files header. In a valid 1x1 gif file the ， header should be ，  ( in hex )  : 47 49 46 38 39 61 01 00 01 00 . After the header we will insert",
