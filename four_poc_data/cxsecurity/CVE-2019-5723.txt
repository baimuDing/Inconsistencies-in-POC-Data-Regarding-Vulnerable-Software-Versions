Moreover , the keyword is static and quite ， too short. Due to this , the passwords stored by the application can be easily ， decrypted. ， Vulnerability Details :  ， Both user passwords in the database and the password for the database itself ， in the 'portiervision.ini' configuration file are stored reversible encrypted. ， The enforced password policy requires at least 1 up to 15 character long ， passwords. ， The passwords are encrypted by a VigenA\"re cipher , which is a series of ， interwoven Caesar ciphers based on the characters of the keyword. In this ， particular application , the keyword is static and 15 bytes long. Static ， means , in this special case , hard coded. ， Once an attacker has access to the encrypted passwords , he or she can easily ， decrypt these and , thereby , escalate his or her privileges. As decrypting the ， user passwords the privilege escalation is obviously limited to the ， application. But because the same keyword is reused for encrypting the ， database password , attackers might go beyond this point and try out these ， credentials to take over control of other systems in the corporate network.",
