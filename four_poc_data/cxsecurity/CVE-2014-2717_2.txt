The vulnerability is assigned with reference ， CVE-2015-0984. ， Rather than the application level administrative access as discussed in ， the email regarding CVE-2014-2717 , this focuses on issues with the FTP ,  ， default accounts which could not be changed , and high privileges of the ， web server user resulting in a simple shell on the server. ， In this case we are looking at CVE-2015-0984 , or ICSA-15-076-02 , but we ， expect to be back with a second disclosure soon when the vendor have had ， a chance to look at the latest finding , still pending a CVE , if one will ， be assigned. ， For those interested in a more readable version of this disclosure and ， additional information , see ， Please note that the CVE at NVD uses a different CVSS vector than the ， one in this disclosure or from ICS-CERT , stating partial confidentiality ， and no availability or integrity impact. As this gives shell access to ， the system , I am relatively certain the C : C/A : C/I : C is the correct ， evaluation. ， _ ，  * BACKGROUND *  ， Honeywell is a US-based company that maintains offices worldwide. ， The affected products , XLWeb controllers , are web-based SCADA systems. ， According to Honeywell , XLWeb controllers are deployed across several ， sectors including Critical Manufacturing , Energy , Water and Waste water ， Systems , and others. Honeywell estimates that these products are used ， primarily in Europe and the Middle East. ， _ ，  * VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW *  ， The vulnerability is defined as a PATH TRAVERSAL. By using a directory ， traversal vulnerability in the FTP server , it is possible to gain access ， to the web root directory. ， A CVSS v2 base score of 10.0 has been assigned ; the CVSS vector string ， is ( AV : N/AC : L/Au : N/C : C/I : C/A : C )  ， That is ;  ， Access Vector Network ， Access Complexity Low ， Authentication None <- Built in account used to target the system ， Complete impact to availability , integrity and confidentiality. ， Note that NVD uses an incorrect scoring which lists integrity and ， availability as unaffected , and confidentiality as partial. ， _ ，  * MITIGATION *  ， The update for this vulnerability is Excel Web Linux version 2.04.01 ，  ( March , 2014 ) or later plus the programming tool CARE version 10.02 ，  ( March 2014 ) or later. Customers are encouraged to contact their local ， Honeywell HBS branch to have their sites updated to the latest version. ， In the Centraline partner channel , Excel Web controllers also have been ， sold under the brand name FALCON. Centraline partners can directly ， access and get these versions. ， Linux :  ， CARE :  ， _ ，  * EXTENDED DISCLOSURE *  ， The system has an account for localization and customization of parts of ， the interfaces. The account is available in numerous guides as found ， online , account name is XWADMIN. ， This account has access to the FTP server , and is also available for ， login via TELNET if present. The XWADMIN user is also the user executing ， the web-server on the platform. ， The platform uses a version of PHP with some vendor modifications , of ， importance to an attacker however is that the server support all the ， basic functionality one would need from a simple web-shell such as the ， exec and passthru functions. ， FTP ( Windows command line )  ， FTP honeydemo.internal ， Connected to honeydemo.internal. ， 220- ， 220- #  #  ， 220- # Welcome to the embedded ftp server #  ， 220- #  #  ， 220- ， 220 xlweb FTP server ( GNU inetutils 1.3b ) ready. ， User ( honeydemo.internal :  ( none )  : xwadmin ， 331 Password required for xwadmin. ， Password :  ， 230 User xwadmin logged in.",
