Nothing can be done with them ， though, so it's not possible to read or modify them. ， There are also some other less than wanted behaviors that can be done ， with \".\" and \".\" directories, such as \"DELETE .\" command can give ， errors. Also with maildir if you store indexes in different directory ， than mails this command can be used to delete the index files. Anyway I ， don't see any of these as security issues. ， Hopefully most people have their mail directory under user's home ， directory, so this would only list the home directory's contents. ， But if you do have users' mails stored in eg. under /var/mail/%u/ ， directory, giving that command would list everything under /var/mail, ， assuming that the process has permissions to do that (that's why you ， should be using different UIDs for users if possible). ， This affects 1.0 beta releases, but not 0.99.x. Also the older snapshots ， called \"1.0 stable\" are affected. 1.0 beta8 and later are not affected. ， Patch for the fix is in ， Thanks for Bill Boebel for noticing \"DELETE .\" doing weird things with ， maildir."
