    "text": "vul_name : TOR 0.2.5.5 connecting a Tor client to a Tor hidden server ， vul_cve : CVE-2014-5117 ， vul_poc : This is with regards to an email exchange that took place few days back on the or-talk mailing list. The anonymous client connects to the hidden service quite intermittently . However it does sometimes connects ( say in 1 in 20 chances ) . The client and server are properly configured using default configuration for the client and configuration for the server ， which indicates the appropriate directory where the server stores the appropriate files and the appropriate hidden service port number where service requests are to be directed. I am sure of it since I the client works fine otherwise ( when not connecting anonymously to a non-anonymous service ) and so does the server ( when being used as a client ) . Only in some instances is the client able to communicate with the hidden service ( as mentioned earlier ) . ， This is what Roger Dingledine has to say regarding the issue :  ， \"I think there's a real bug here. I've been playing with it on and off. I ， think that when Tor has a rendezvous circuit that it thinks it should ， like , and suddenly changes its mind , then it discards that circuit and ， starts working on a new one ( which is good )  , but at the same time it ， closes the socks stream ( which is bad ) . ， Fixing that bug , if it turns out to actually be a bug , would mean that ， hidden services are dirt slow when making the initial connection ( until ， we make Tor itself faster at least )  , but they're not as flaky as they ， currently appear. ， -Roger \" ， I can send the notices.log and debug.log files from both the client and the hidden service to you as and when needed . They ， are too big to fit in here . Let me know if it is needed , and I can send to you those files to appropriate email ids where ， you would like them . ， Thanks ， Sambuddho",
