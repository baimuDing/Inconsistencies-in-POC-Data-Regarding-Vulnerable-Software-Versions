This can allow an attacker to compromise the privacy of the applications users. This has been fixed in Adobe AIR SDK release v23.0.0.257. ， Details ， Adobe AIR is a developer product which allows the same application code to be compiled and run across multiple desktop and mobile platforms. While monitoring network traffic during testing of several Android applications we observed network traffic over HTTP without the use of SSL going to several Adobe servers including the following :  ， - airdownload2.adobe.com ， - mobiledl.adobe.com ， Because encryption is not used , this would allow a network-level attacker to observe the traffic and compromise the privacy of the applications users. ， This affects applications compiled with the Adobe AIR SDK versions 22.0.0.153 and earlier. ， Vendor Response ， Adobe has released a fix for this issue on September 13th , 2016 in Adobe AIR SDK v23.0.0.257.
