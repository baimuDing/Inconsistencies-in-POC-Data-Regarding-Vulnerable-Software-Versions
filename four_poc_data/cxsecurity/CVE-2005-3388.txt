This advisory describes one of these ， flaws concerning a weakness in the phpinfo() function, which allows ， Cross Site Scripting (XSS). ， Details: ， The phpinfo() function outputs a large amount of information about ， the current state of PHP. This includes information about PHP ， compilation options and extensions, the PHP version, server ， information and environment (if compiled as a module), the PHP ， environment, OS version information, paths, master and local ， values of configuration options and request variables, HTTP ， headers, and the PHP License. ， Because phpinfo() leaks a lot of information to the viewer it is ， not recommended to leave a script executing phpinfo() on a ， production server. However in reality phpinfo() scripts are left ， open on a lot of servers. While this is already bad enough, there ， is also a problem when request variables of a certain form are ， displayed. With a properly crafted URL, that contains a stacked ， array assignment it is f.e. possible to inject HTML code into the ， output of phpinfo(), which could result in the leakage of domain ， cookies (f.e. session identifiers)."
