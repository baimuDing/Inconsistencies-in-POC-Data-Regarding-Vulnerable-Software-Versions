There is a flaw in graphData.cgi allowing for unauthenticated users to proxy and relay HTTP/HTTPS traffic through the perfSONAR server. The vulnerability can potentially be leveraged to exfiltrate or enumerate data from internal web servers. ， This vulnerability was patched in perfSONAR v4.4.5. ， There is a whitelisting function that will mitigate , but is disabled by default. ， Proof of Concept ， Examples ， Here are three examples of this vulnerability in use. To pass a regex match , the URL must include /esmond/perfsonar/archive/./././ . ， Example 1 :  ， In this example , www.google.com is proxied through perfSONAR server. ， This is an image ， Example 2 :  ， In this example , sample data is exfiltrated from another adjacent internal web host , running an arbitrary port 4444. ， Example 3 :  ， In this example , we are able to download a malicious Powershell script through the perfSONAR server. ， Remediation ， Enable whitelisting in perfSONAR. ， Update perfSONAR to 4.4.5 or newer.",
