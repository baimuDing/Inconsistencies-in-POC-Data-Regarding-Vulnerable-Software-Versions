In particular , please note the ， \"Users affected\" , \"Versions affected\" , and \"Mitigation\" sections. ， The project team will be announcing a release vote shortly for Apache Hadoop ， 2.0.1-alpha , which will be comprised of the contents of Apache Hadoop ， 2.0.0-alpha , this security patch , and a few patches for YARN. ， Best ,  ， Aaron T. Myers ， Software Engineer , Cloudera ， CVE-2012-3376 : Apache Hadoop HDFS information disclosure vulnerability ， Severity : Critical ， Vendor : The Apache Software Foundation ， Versions Affected : Hadoop 2.0.0-alpha ， Users affected :  ， Users who have enabled Hadoop's Kerberos/HDFS security features. ， Impact :  ， Malicious clients may gain write access to data for which they have read-only ， permission , or gain read access to any data blocks whose IDs they can ， determine. ， Description :  ， When Hadoop's security features are enabled , clients authenticate to DataNodes ， using BlockTokens issued by the NameNode to the client. The DataNodes are able ， to verify the validity of a BlockToken , and will reject BlockTokens that were ， not issued by the NameNode. The DataNode determines whether or not it should ， check for BlockTokens when it registers with the NameNode. ， Due to a bug in the DataNode/NameNode registration process , a DataNode which ， registers more than once for the same block pool will conclude that it ， thereafter no longer needs to check for BlockTokens sent by clients. That is ,  ， the client will continue to send BlockTokens as part of its communication with ， DataNodes , but the DataNodes will not check the validity of the tokens. A ， DataNode will register more than once for the same block pool whenever the ， NameNode restarts , or when HA is enabled. ， Mitigation :  ， Users of 2.0.0-alpha should immediately apply the patch provided below to their ， systems. Users should upgrade to 2.0.1-alpha as soon as it becomes available. ， Credit : This issue was discovered by Aaron T. Myers of Cloudera. ， A signed patch against Apache Hadoop 2.0.0-alpha for this issue can be found ， here : ",
