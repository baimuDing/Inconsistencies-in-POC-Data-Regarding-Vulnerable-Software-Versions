This protection can be bypassed for ， registry key 'HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Symantec\\CCPD\\SuiteOwners' using API functions RegSaveKey and RegRestoreKey. This registry ， key is also used to store some important information such us names of libraries, for example 'NISProd.dll'. Using ， RegSaveKey and RegRestoreKey a malicious application can modify values in 'SuiteOwners' such that Norton loads fake ， library into its own processes. A malicious code in the fake library can manipulate any Norton component and thus bypass ， every security protection of Norton. ， Vulnerable software: ， * Norton Personal Firewall 2006 version 9.1.0.33 ， * probably all versions of Norton Personal Firewall 2006 and Norton Internet Security 2006 ， * possibly older versions of Norton Personal Firewall and Norton Internet Security ， More details and proof of concept is available ， here ， s-protection-bypass.php ， Regards, ， David Matousek ， Founder and Chief Representative of Matousec - Transparent security"
