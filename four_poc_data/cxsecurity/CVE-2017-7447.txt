Description :  ， Cross-Site Request Forgery ( CSRF ) is an attack that forces an end user to execute unwanted actions on a web application in which they're currently authenticated. CSRF attacks specifically target state-changing requests , not theft of data , since the attacker has no way to see the response to the forged request. With a little help of social engineering ( such as sending a link via email or chat )  , an attacker may trick the users of a web application into executing actions of the attacker's choosing. If the victim is a normal user , a successful CSRF attack can force the user to perform state changing requests like transferring funds , changing their email address , and so forth. If the victim is an administrative account , CSRF can compromise the entire web application. ， HelpDEZK have role for type person :  ， admin = 1 ， user = 2 ， operator = 3 ， costumer = 4 ， partner = 5 ， group = 6",
