Probably the most important of these is the IFormatter serializers , specifically BinaryFormatter which has existed in one form since the very first version of the framework. ， It is common to see this used as a mechanism for data storage , object marshalling and object cloning. This can lead to situations where an attacker can introduce malicious objects into an application either remotely over a network or through a sandboxed environment. ， Through the use of specific functionality an attacker can then leverage this situation to circumvent security mechanisms and gain remote code execution without user interaction or to disclosure important information. ， Technologies Affected ， Microsoft .Net Frameworks 1.0 through 4.0 ， Vendor Response ， Microsoft advises users to patch the .Net Framework to the latest version. See the following Microsoft security bulletin for more details :  ， There are a number of mitigations which reduce the severity of the issues which are also detailed in Microsofts bulletin.",
