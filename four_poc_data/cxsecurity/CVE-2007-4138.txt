This ， functionality is enabled by defining the \"winbind nss info\" ， smb.conf option to either \"sfu\" or \"rfc2307\". ， Both the Windows \"Identity Management for Unix\" and \"Services for ， Unix\" MMC plug-ins allow a user to be assigned a primary group ， When the rfc2307 or sfu nss_info plugin has been enabled , in ， the absence of either the RFC2307 or SFU primary group attribute ,  ， Winbind will assign a primary group ID of 0 to the domain user ， queried using the getpwnam (  ) C library call. ， Patch Availability ， A patch addressing this defect has been posted to ， Additionally , Samba 3.0.26 has been issued as a security ， release to correct the defect. ， Workaround ， Samba and Active Directory administrators may avoid this security ， issue by two methods :  ，  ( a ) Ensure that all user's stored in AD are properly assigned a ， Unix primary group , or ，  ( b ) Discontinue use of the sfu or rfc2307 \"winbind nss info\" plugin ， until a patched version of the idmap_ad.so library can be ， installed. ， Note that the problem is only evident on servers using the sfu ， or rfc2307 \"winbind nss info\" plugin and not those only making ， use of Winbind's idmap_ad IDMap backend interface. ， Credits ， This vulnerability was reported to Samba developers by Rick King ， as Samba Bug # 4927. ， The time line is as follows :  ，  * Aug 29 , 2007 : Initial report from Rick King. ，  * Aug 29 , 2007 : First response from Samba developers confirming ， the bug along with a proposed patch. ，  * Sep 4 , 2007 : Announcement to vendor-sec mailing list. ，  * Sep 11 , 2007 : Public security advisory made available. ， = Our Code , Our Bugs , Our Responsibility. ， = The Samba Team",
