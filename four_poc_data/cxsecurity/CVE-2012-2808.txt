    "text": "vul_name : Android <= 4.0.4 DNS poisoning ( youtube tutorial )  ， vul_cve : CVE-2012-2808 ， vul_poc : 1 Introduction ， Recently we discovered a very interesting vulnerability in Android's DNS resolver , a weakness in its pseudo-random number generator ( PRNG )  , which makes DNS poisoning attacks feasible. ， The full advisory can be found at ， A blog post can be found at ， Demo of our PoC can be found at ， 2 Vulnerability ， The PRNG that the DNS resolver uses is ， random_id = 0xffff & ( time_usec ^ time_sec ^ pid )  ， where time_sec is the current time in seconds , time_usec is the microseconds fraction and pid is the process identifier. ， Both the TXID and source port are generated by this PRNG. Since both calls occur subsequently , the values are very much correlated to each other. This yields a feasible attack expected time as we show that the number of random bits is brought down from 32 ( ideally ) to less than 21. ， Check our advisory for full details. ， 3 Vulnerable versions ， Android 4.0.4 and below. ， 4 Vendor Response ， Android 4.1.1 has been released , and patches are available on AOSP. The random sample is now pulled from /dev/urandom , which should have adequate entropy by the time network activity occurs. ， 5 Identifier ， CVE-2012-2808 ， 6 Discovered by ， Roee Hay & Roi Saltzman ， IBM Application Security Research Group ， 7 Disclosure timeline ， 07/24/2012 Public disclosure ， 06/05/2012 Issue confirmed by Android Security Team and patch provided to partners. ， 05/21/2012 Disclosed to Android Security Team.",
