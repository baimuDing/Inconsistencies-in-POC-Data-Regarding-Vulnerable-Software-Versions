    "text": "vul_name : BIND 9.10.1 Defects in GeoIP Crash ， vul_cve : CVE-2014-8680 ， vul_poc : CVE : CVE-2014-8680 ， Document Version : 2.0 ， Posting date : 08 December 2014 ， Program Impacted : BIND 9 ， Versions affected : 9.10.0 -> 9.10.1 ， Severity : High ， Exploitable : Remotely ， Description :  ， Multiple errors have been identified in the GeoIP features added in BIND 9.10. Two are capable of crashing BIND - triggering either can cause named to exit with an assertion failure , resulting in a denial of service condition. A third defect is also corrected , which could have caused GeoIP databases to not be loaded properly if their location was changed while BIND was running. ， Only servers built to include GeoIP functionality are affected. ， Impact :  ， The GeoIP features in BIND 9.10 are enabled by a compile-time option which is not selected by default. If you did not compile your BIND binary , or do not know whether you selected GeoIP features , you can test whether the functionality is compiled in by examining the output of the command \"named -V\" for \"-with-geoip\". Only servers which were compiled with GeoIP enabled can be affected by these defects. ， Servers which encounter either of the first two defects will terminate with an \"assertion failure\" error. ， CVSS Score : 5.4 ， CVSS Vector :  ( AV : N/AC : H/Au : N/C : N/I : N/A : C )  ， For more information on the Common Vulnerability Scoring System and to obtain your specific environmental score please visit :  ， Workarounds :  ， Of the two errors , the first can occur with server binaries which were configured with GeoIP enabled if an IPv4 GeoIP database is loaded but no corresponding IPv6 database is found or if an IPv6 GeoIP database is loaded but no corresponding IPv4 database is found. This error can be avoided by ensuring that both IPv6 and IPv4 GeoIP databases are loaded. ， A workaround for the second error is to disable IPv6 support by running named with the -4 option or configuring with \"listen-on-v6 { none ; } ; \". ， Upgrading to a patched version is recommended. ， Active exploits :  ， No known active exploits.",
