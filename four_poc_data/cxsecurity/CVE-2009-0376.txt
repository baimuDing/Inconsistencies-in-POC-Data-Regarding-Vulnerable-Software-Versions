A remote attacker could craft a malicious IVR file , that when sent to an unsuspecting user , may allow the execution of arbitrary code when viewed , using one of two vulnerabilities during RealPlayer's IVR processing routine :  ，  * A heap corruption vulnerability that occurs when altering a field that determines the length of a structure ，  * A vulnerability that allows an attacker to write one null byte to an arbitrary memory address by using an overly long file name length value ， It should be noted that the victim does not necessarily have to open the malicious file for exploitation to occur : the vulnerabilities lie in a DLL that is also used as a plugin for the Windows Explorer shell. A successful attack could take place by merely previewing the IVR file through Windows Explorer. ， Solutions :  ， The FortiGuard Global Security Research Team released the signature \"RealNetworks.RealPlayer.IVR.File.Processing.Code.Execution\" ， Fortinet customers who subscribe to Fortinet& # 161 ; & # 175 ; s intrusion prevention ( IPS ) service should be protected against these code execute vulnerabilities.
