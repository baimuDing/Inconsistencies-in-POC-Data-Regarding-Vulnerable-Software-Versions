A remote attacker might cause system with CSA installed to restart or BSOD. By sending carefully crafted data an attacker might cause remote code execution , thus gains complete control over the system. ， By default CSA allows access to TCP ports 139 and 445. After establishing a session to TCP ports 139 and 445 , an attacker can complete an exploitation without any authentication simply by sending a single packet. ， Cisco Security Agent for Windows version 5.2.0.225 and prior are affected. Other Cisco software that uses CSA component is also affected. ， Workaround :  ，  * Restrict access to TCP ports 139 and 445. ， Vendor Status :  ， 2007.09.27 Informed the vendor ， 2007.10.23 Vendor confirmed the vulnerability ， 2007.12.05 Vendor released a security advisory ( cisco-sa-20071205-csa ) and related patches. ， For more details about the Cisco security advisory , please refer to :  ， Additional Information :  ， The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures ( CVE ) project has assigned the name CVE-2007-5580 to this issue. This is a candidate for inclusion in the CVE list ( which standardizes names for security problems. Candidates may change significantly before they become official CVE entries. ， Credit :  ， NSFOCUS Security Team ， DISCLAIMS :  ， THE INFORMATION PROVIDED IS RELEASED BY NSFOCUS \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND.
