The company?s main product , Kaspersky Anti-Virus , regularly receives top awards in tests conducted by respected international research centers and IT publications. Kaspersky Lab was the first to develop many technological standards in the antivirus industry , including full-scale solutions for Linux , Unix and NetWare , a new-generation heuristic analyzer designed to detect newly emerging viruses , effective protection against polymorphic and macro viruses , continuously updated antivirus databases and a technique for detecting viruses in archived files. ， Source :  ， VULNERABLE PRODUCTS ， Kaspersky Anti-Virus 5.0 for Windows Workstations ( 5.0.712 )  ， Kaspersky Antivirus Personal 5.0.x ， Kaspersky Anti-Virus 6.0 for Windows Workstations ( 6.0.3.837 )  ， Kaspersky Anti-Virus 6.0 for Windows File Servers ( 6.0.3.837 )  ， Kaspersky Anti-Virus 7 ( 7.0.1.325 )  ， Kaspersky Anti-Virus 2009 ( 8.0.0.x )  ， Kaspersky Anti-Virus 2010 ( 9.0.0.463 )  ， Kaspersky Internet Security 7 ( 7.0.1.325 )  ， Kaspersky Internet Security 2009 ( 8.0.0.x )  ， Kaspersky Internet Security 2010 ( 9.0.0.463 )  ， Prior versions may also be affected. ， DETAILS ， Insecure permissions have been detected in the multiple Kaspersky Lab antivirus products. ?Everyone\" group has ?Full Control? rights to the BASES folder. The folder consists of antivirus bases , configuration files and executable modules. Local attacker ( unprivileged user ) can replace some files ( for example , executable modules ) by malicious file and execute arbitrary code with SYSTEM privileges. This is local privilege escalation vulnerability. ， For example , in Kaspersky Anti-Virus 2010 ( 9.0.0.463 ) the following attack scenario could be used :  ， 1. An attacker ( unprivileged user ) replaces one of the * .kdl files by malicious dynamic link library ( DLL ) . The replacing file could be - %ALLUSERSPROFILE%\\Application Data\\Kaspersky Lab\\AVP9\\Bases\\vulns.kdl. ， 2. Restart the system. ， After restart attackers malicious DLL will be loaded with SYSTEM privileges. ， Self-defense of the Kaspersky Anti-Virus will prevent all operations with own files. It can be bypassed using internal shell dialogs in Kaspersky Anti-Virus ( for example , \"Open\" dialoginQuarantine ) . ， For other vulnerable Kaspersky Lab products similar attack scenario could be used. ， EXPLOITATION ， An attacker must have valid logon credentials to a system where vulnerable software is installed. ， WORKAROUND ， Kaspersky Lab has addressed this vulnerability by releasing fixed versions of the vulnerable products :  ， Kaspersky Anti-Virus 2010 ( 9.0.0.736 )  ， Kaspersky Internet Security 2010 ( 9.0.0.736 )  ， Kaspersky Anti-Virus 6.0 for Windows Workstations ( 6.0.4.1212 )  ， Kaspersky Anti-Virus 6.0 for Windows File Servers ( 6.0.4.1212 ) ",
