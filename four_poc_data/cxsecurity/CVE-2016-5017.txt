If the command string ， exceeds 1024 characters a buffer overflow will occur. There is no ， known compromise which takes advantage of this vulnerability , and if ， security is enabled the attacker would be limited by client level ， security constraints. The C cli shell is intended as a sample/example ， of how to use the C client interface , not as a production tool - the ， documentation has also been clarified on this point. ， Mitigation :  ， It is important to use the fully featured/supported Java cli shell rather ， than the C cli shell independent of version. ， - ZooKeeper 3.4.x users should upgrade to 3.4.9 or apply this patch :  ， - ZooKeeper 3.5.x users should upgrade to 3.5.3 when released or apply ， this patch :  ， The patch solves the problem reported here , but it does not make the ， client ready for production use. The community has no plan to make ， this client production ready at this time , and strongly recommends that ， users move to the Java cli and use the C cli for illustration purposes only. ， Credit :  ， This issue was discovered by Lyon Yang , an Apple security researcher.",
