This advisory describes the results of the ， tests run against Community Server. ， Details :  ， Community Server is vulnerable to the attacks described in the ， pingback advisory. Because of the license restrictions on this software ,  ， our testing was limited. However , it was found that at a minimum one could ， specify an arbitrary sourceURI in the pingback service call. It was also ， found that there were no limitations on the Content-Type or size of the ， sourceURI. In all tests , the server attempted to fetch large binary data ， from all provided URIs. A malicious user could abuse this service by ， sending multiple requests where the sourceURI resolved to a large file on ， a variety of servers. This can create a DoS scenario by either utilizing ， all available bandwidth or by causing the server to allocate all available ， threads to service requests. In testing it was found that both scenarios ， could be produced. Also see 4tphi-sa-20070111-wordpress for tests run. ， Recommendations :  ， In order to prevent overly large files from being retrieved , a ， reasonable timeout for the request for the sourceURI should be set. Also ,  ， should not be read as it can not be parsed. There are some more ， significant design problems , particularly with respect to pingback ， authentication. These are described in the pingback advisory and are not ， addressed here , as there has been no formal specification modification ， yet.",
