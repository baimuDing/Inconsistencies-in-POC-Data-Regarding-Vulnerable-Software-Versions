Three distinct cases were ， identified as follows :  ， The AMQP 0-10 protocol defines a sequence set containing id ， ranges. The qpidd broker can be crashed by sending it a sequence-set ， containing an invalid range , where the start of the range is after the ， end. This condition causes an assertion , which causes the broker ， process to exit. ， The AMQP 0-10 protocol defines header- and body- segments that may ， follow certain commands. The only command for which such segments are ， expected by qpidd is the message-transfer command. If another command ， is sent that includes header and/or body segments , this will cause a ， segmentation fault in the broker process , causing it then to exit. ， The AMQP 0-10 protocol defines a session-gap control that can be sent ， on any established session. The qpidd broker does not support this ， control and responds with an appropriate error if requested on an ， established session. However , if the control is sent before the ， session is opened , the brokers handling causes an assertion which ， results in the broker process exiting.",
