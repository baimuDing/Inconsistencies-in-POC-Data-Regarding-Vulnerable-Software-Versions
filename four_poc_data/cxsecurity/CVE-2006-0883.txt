Background ， OpenSSH is an implementation of the SSH protocol suite , providing an ， encrypted , authenticated transport for a variety of services ,  ， including remote shell access. ， Privilege separation is a mechanism used by OpenSSH to protect itself ， against possible future vulnerabilities. It works by splitting the ， server process in two : the child process drops its privileges and ， carries on the conversation with the client , while the parent retains ， its privileges , monitors the child , and performs privileged operations ， on behalf of the child when it is satisified that everything is in ， order. Privilege separation is enabled by default in FreeBSD. ， OpenPAM is an implementation of the PAM framework , which allows the ， use of loadable modules to implement user authentication and session ， management in a manner defined by the administrator. It is used by ， OpenSSH and numerous other applications in FreeBSD to provide a ， consistent and configurable authentication system. ， II. Problem Description ， Because OpenSSH and OpenPAM have conflicting designs ( one is event- ， driven while the other is callback-driven )  , it is necessary for ， OpenSSH to fork a child process to handle calls to the PAM framework. ， However , if the unprivileged child terminates while PAM authentication ， is under way , the parent process incorrectly believes that the PAM ， child also terminated. The parent process then terminates , and the ， PAM child is left behind. ， Due to the way OpenSSH performs internal accounting , these orphaned ， PAM children are counted as pending connections by the master OpenSSH ， server process. Once a certain number of orphans has accumulated , the ， master decides that it is overloaded and stops accepting client ， connections. ， III. Impact ， By repeatedly connecting to a vulnerable server , waiting for a ， password prompt , and closing the connection , an attacker can cause ， OpenSSH to stop accepting client connections until the system restarts ， or an administrator manually kills the orphaned PAM processes. ， IV. Workaround ， The following command will show a list of orphaned PAM processes :  ，  # pgrep -lf ' [ pam ] ' ， The following command will kill orphaned PAM processes :  ，  # pkill -f ' [ pam ] ' ， To prevent OpenSSH from leaving orphaned PAM processes behind , perform ， one of the following :  ， 1 ) Disable PAM authentication in OpenSSH. Users will still be able to ， log in using their Unix password , OPIE or SSH keys. ， To do this , execute the following commands as root :  ，  # echo 'UsePAM no' /etc/ssh/sshd_config ，  # /etc/rc.d/sshd restart ， 2 ) If disabling PAM is not an option - if , for instance , you use ， RADIUS authentication , or store user passwords in an SQL database - ， you may instead disable privilege separation. However , this may ， leave OpenSSH vulnerable to hitherto unknown bugs , and should be ， considered a last resort. ， To do this , execute the following commands as root :  ，  # echo 'UsePrivilegeSeparation no' /etc/ssh/sshd_config ，  # /etc/rc.d/sshd restart ， V. Solution ， Perform one of the following :  ， 1 ) Upgrade your vulnerable system to 5-STABLE or to the RELENG_5_4 or ， RELENG_5_3 security branch dated after the correction date. ， 2 ) To patch your present system :  ， The following patches have been verified to apply to FreeBSD 5.3 and ， 5.4 systems. ， a ) Download the relevant patch from the location below , and verify the ， detached PGP signature using your PGP utility. ，  # fetch ftp : /ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/CERT/patches/SA-06 : 09/openssh.patch ，  # fetch ftp : /ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/CERT/patches/SA-06 : 09/openssh.patch.as ， c ， b ) Execute the following commands as root : ",
