So , telnetting to port 23 ( on is default IP 192.168.0.1 ) the users get automatically access to the filesystem , by providing no credentials at all. Now the file system of the device may be used for malicious communication and temporary data storage. Too , a user may download the upgrade firware's HTML code from the www directory and modify it locally so allow other files than IMGs to be uploaded and replace the existing firmware , making the device useless. ， Also , one can view the contents of /etc/htpasswd file , where everything is in plaintext , and retrieve the web-based administrator's ( admin ) password. Some of the possible implications , that can be triggered from the web-interface , but not limited to the following , are :  ， 1. Intruders are now capable to open the configuration page and go through the submenus where they can get the wireless key in use ( the wireless key is being displayed in plaintext , as well )  ， 2. They can perform a trivial DoS attack ( factory restart the modem and everything stops working ) similarly from the telnet session , by issuing the command \"reboot\" the device will obey and it will restart itself ， 3. They can change configurations and policies for clients causing confusion ， 4. Or they could download a backup copy of the configuration file for the device ( the same file can be obtained by viewing the contents of \"/tmp/nvram\" )  ; by viewing that file one can easily extract the ADSL account logins or any other information is curious about , as everything is stored in plaintext - once again )  ， IV Vulnerability Exploited Successfully :  ， 1. While we were connected through the Ethernet interface , and ， 2. While we were connected via the security-enabled ( WPA2-PSK ) wireless network we had setup ( and our wireless NIC's MAC address was in the list of the trusted MACs ) ",
