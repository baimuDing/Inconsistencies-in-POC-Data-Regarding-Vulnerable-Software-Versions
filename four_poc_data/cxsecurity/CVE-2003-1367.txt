At first we were not sure if it was a one ， time problem or a common issue, so we checked several other servers ， and installed Majordomo ourselves and found ALL Majordomo versions to ， be vulnerable, also the latest Majordomo 2 (alpha). ， The problem: ， All email addresses can be extracted from mailinglists for which ， 'which_access' is set to \"open\" in the configuration file, which_access ， is set to \"open\" by default ! ， Majordomo 1.94.5 documentation quote: ， \"8. By default, anyone (even non-subscribers) can use the commands ， \"who\", \"which\", \"index\", and \"get\" on a list. If you create an ， empty file named \"listname.private\" in the $listdir directory, only ， members of the list can use those commands.\" ， Typical case of RTFDOC of course, but still, why isn't the private ， configuration file the default one (?!), now people actually have to read ， the documentation to protect their lists against evil spammers. We all ， know that admins do not always read the docs (uhuh). ， So this bug can be exploited without being subscribed to any mailinglist ， on that server when \"which_access\" is set to open. This bug can be exploited ， by sending: ， which @ ， or ， which . ， To the Majordomo daemon. Majordomo will then match \"@\" (or \".\") on all the ， mailinglists that have 'which_access' set to \"open\". This then matches ， all email addresses that are subscribed to that list. ， There is a slight difference between the new Majordomo 2 (alpha) and the ， current Majordomo 1.94.x branch. ， Majordomo 1.94.x gives output such as this: ， which @ ， The string '@' appears in the following ， entries in lists served by majordomo (at) somedomain (dot) com [email concealed]: ， List Address ， test-list user (at) somedomain (dot) com [email concealed] ， test-list anotheruser (at) anotherdomain (dot) com [email concealed] ， another-list satan (at) evilmajordomodomain (dot) net [email concealed] ， another-list bush (at) sopranos (dot) org [email concealed] ， etc. ， Majordomo 2 also has the bug, not as much as the 1.94.x though: ， which @ ， The pattern \"/\\@/i\" ， matched the following subscriptions. ， Matches for the devils mailing list: ， satan (at) majordomo (dot) org [email concealed] ， - Match limit of 1 for devils exceeded. ， Matches for the britney mailing list: ， eminem (at) spears (dot) net [email concealed] ， - Match limit of 1 for britney exceeded. ， Impact: ， High. Not only privacy is the issue here, this bug could be used by evil ， spammers to fill their databases. And the users did much of their work for ， them already, as the victims are usually well targeted (subject-specific ， mailinglists come to mind)."
