Resolved in IronMail 6.1.1 HotFix-17 ， CVE Number : CVE-2006-5210 ， Overview :  ， IronMail is an Internet e-mail security appliance marketed by ， CipherTrust , Inc. a company specializing in messaging security. ， IronMail's features include anti-spam mechanisms , zero day anti-virus ， protection , intrusion prevention techniques , and a Secure WebMail ， component. Secure WebMail implements Single Sign-On and integrates ， RSA SecurID ; it operates in conjunction with the IronWebMail HTTPS ， server. ， Details :  ， The web server under IronWebMail employes a simple macro language ， as a result of faulty pathname evaluation , causing unauthenticated ， access violation. ， After a connection to TCP port 443 has been accepted and an SSL ， session has been negotiated , a specially crafted HTTP GET request is ， sent. An exploit request contains the IM_FILE identifier that can be ， gleaned from the HTML source of the main IronWebMail login page :  ， GET /IM_FILE ( . ) HTTP/1.0 [ CRLF ]  [ CRLF ]  ，  [ Current Working Directory Data Received From Web Server. ]  ， A request for the current working directory was made using custom ， IronWebMail server pathname syntax. The returned response payload ， is the byte-wise representation of the web root directory. This is ， the base case ; other directories can be viewed as well as file ， contents. For example :  ， GET /IM_FILE ( %252e%252e/%252e%252e/%252e%252e ) HTTP/1.0 [ CRLF ]  [ CRLF ]  ，  [ Directory Data for Great-Grandparent of CWD. ]  ， This request will display the contents of the ufs directory three-levels ， up from the current working directory of the web server process. ， Although literal pathnames can be provided , doubly encoding the file ， location with URI ASCII escaping allows for deeper directory traversals. ， This technique can be used to retrieve any file or directory accessible ， by the web server process. An attacker with novice programming skills ， is capable of writing a script to automate remote file system ， reconnaissance by taking advantage of this issue.",
