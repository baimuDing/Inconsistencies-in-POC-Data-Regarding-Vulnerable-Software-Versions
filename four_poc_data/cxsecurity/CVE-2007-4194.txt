    "text": "vul_name : Encase 5.0 Encase Pre-Advisory ， vul_cve : CVE-2007-4194 ， vul_poc : Breakpoint Security Advisory ， Affected Vendor :  ， Guidance Software ， Affected Products :  ， Encase 5.0 and possibly other version ， Background :  ， With Encase's recent response to the iSec's security report and their ability to both market their product while at the same time minimizing their products issues , Breakpoint Security decided to advise Encase to take their software's assurance a bit more serious. In the course of 6 hours researchers from Breakpoint Security conducted not so intensive tests of about 10 scenarios utilizing specialized proprietary software like dd , xd and ultraedit. ， As a result of this testing regimen , Breakpoint Security was able to identify multiple bugs in Encase. All the testing done OBVIOUSLY involved intentionally corrupted files. We contend that any issues found in software written for forensic purposes must not fall victim to possibly infected images. While this problem may simply postpone an investigation , other more critical issues could result in more intrusive actions. ， Vulnerability Details :  ， Vulnerability details will be disclosed at a later date. The vulnerability resides in Encase's file system parsing. The malicious user can force encase into an infinite recursion loop , exhausting the stack. ， Credit :  ， Breakpoint Security Research Team",
