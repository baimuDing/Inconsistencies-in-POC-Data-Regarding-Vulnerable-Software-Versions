BACKGROUND ， Macromedia JRun 4 is an application server used for developing and ， deploying Java based applications. More information can be found at ， the following URL :  ， II. DESCRIPTION ， Remote exploitation of a buffer overflow vulnerability in Adobe Inc.'s ， JRun 4 may allow attackers to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial ， of service condition. ， The vulnerability exists within the JRun web server , specifically in the ， handling of long request strings. In certain configurations , when a long ，  ( approximately 64k ) URL is supplied , a stack-based overflow occurs ， potentially allowing the execution of arbitrary code. In testing ， performed by iDefense Labs , it was possible to overwrite the saved ， into 'wide characters' by the server ) . ， III. ANALYSIS ， Successful exploitation may allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary ， code with Local System privileges. The supplied JRun web server must be ， active for the attack vector to exist. It is not recommended to use the ， JRun web server component in production systems , as the installer ， mentions that it should be used for development only. ， As the service restarts after each crash , it is possible to make ， multiple attempts to exploit this issue , and each time restart from a ， 'clean' state. ， Although this vulnerability allows a stack overwrite , it may be more ， difficult to exploit due the input string being converted into a 'wide ， character' version of the str input , by placing a null byte between ， each character. While this does not necessarily prevent exploitation , it ， does increase the complexity of developing an exploit. ， Exploitation of this vulnerability may allow a remote attacker to ， execute code on the affected system as Local System , allowing complete ， compromise , or cause a denial of service against the affected system ,  ， preventing legitimate use. ， IV. DETECTION ， This vulnerability was confirmed by the vendor to affect the JRun 4 ， webserver server prior to the JRun 4 Updater 5 release in March of 2005. ， V. WORKAROUND ， The JRun documentation suggests that the JRun Web Server should not be ， used in a production environment. In a development environment , the ， JRun server should not accept connections from outside of the ， development network. ， VI. VENDOR RESPONSE ， Adobe has reported that this issue was resolved in the JRun 4 Updater 5 ， release in March 2005. ， The following security advisory was released on December 15 , 2005 :  ， VII. CVE INFORMATION ， A Mitre Corp. Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures ( CVE ) number has not ， been assigned yet.",
