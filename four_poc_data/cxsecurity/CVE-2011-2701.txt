One of those protocols is EAP-TLS ， used within 802.1X. In EAP-TLS X.509 client certificates are ， used to authenticate remote users/clients. ， FreeRADIUS supports several methods for checking the revocation ， status of X.509 certificates. Recently support for revocation ， status checking with the Online Certificate Status Protocol ( OCSP )  ， was added to FreeRADIUS. ， During a test of the OCSP support in FreeRADIUS , a security ， vulnerability has been found in the way the FreeRADIUS code parses ， the replies from an OCSP responder. ， This allows a remote attacker to use a revoked certificate from an ， otherwise trusted certification authority ( CA ) to successfully ， authenticate against the FreeRADIUS server if it is configured ， to use EAP-TLS with OCSP certificate validation. ， OCSP is not enabled in the default configuration of FreeRADIUS. ， Solution ， Until now , there is no official patch for the vulnerability. ， Therefore , we strongly advise you to disable OCSP support in the ， FreeRADIUS configuration until an official patch by the packet ， maintainer is available. Instead , the use of certification revocation ， list ( CRL ) checking which is implemented by FreeRADIUS is recommended. ， Details ( CVE-2011-2701 )  ， In the file rlm_eap_tls.c , the ocsp_check (  ) function performs a basic ， verification of the value that is returned by the OCSP service ， OCSP_basic_verify (  )  , but it does not verify the status of the ， certificate itself. Thus , if an attacker has access to a revoked ， certificate and its matching private key , the attacker is able to get ， authenticated against the FreeRADIUS server. ， This allows the attacker to gain access to all network resources that ， are accessible due to the FreeRADIUS authentication , e.g. Internet access. ， To avoid the issue , the status of the certificate has to be checked with ， the OCSP_resp_find_status (  ) function by comparing the returned status ， value against 'V_OCSP_CERTSTATUS_GOOD' , and by checking the freshness of ， the OCSP response with OCSP_check_validity (  ) . ， This advisory and further updates of it will be published at :  ， < ， html> ， New releases , or patches , for the software can be downloaded from the ， official FreeRADIUS web site :  ， < ， Contact ， We created a basic patch for this issue which is not publicly available ， because of possible side effects and a missing test environment. However ,  ， we are willing to send our patch to all Linux/BSD vendors as a basis for ， their own patches. ， Any questions regarding this advisory , or the patch itself ,  ， can be sent to advisory ( at ) dfn-cert ( dot ) de. [ email concealed ]  ， Please note that we will not make our patch publicly available. ， History ， 2011-07-01 Notified the FreeRADIUS project ， 2011-07-22 New version with a full description of the issue ， and the CVE identifier",
