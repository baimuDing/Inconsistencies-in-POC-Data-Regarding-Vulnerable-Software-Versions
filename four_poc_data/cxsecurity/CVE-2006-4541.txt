    "text": "vul_name : ISS BlackICE PC Protection Insufficient validation of arguments of NtOpenSection Vulnerability ， vul_cve : CVE-2006-4541 ， vul_poc : Hello ,  ， I would like to inform you about a vulnerability in BlackICE PC Protection ， driver found by Matousec - Transparent security. ， Description :  ， Hooking SSDT functions requires extra caution. SSDT function handlers are executed in the kernel mode but their callers ， are executed in the user mode. Hence all function arguments come from the user mode. This is why it is necessary to ， validate these arguments properly. Otherwise a simple user call can easily crash the whole system. This bug usually ， results in a system crash. However , it may happen that this bug is even more dangerous and can lead to the execution of ， an arbitrary code in the privileged kernel mode. ， BlackICE fails to validate the third argument of NtOpenSection. A call with invalid values in this argument can cause a ， system crash because of an error in RapDrv.sys. ， Vulnerable software :  ，  * BlackICE PC Protection 3.6.cpn ，  * BlackICE PC Protection 3.6.cpj ，  * BlackICE PC Protection 3.6.cpiE ，  * probably all versions of BlackICE PC Protection 3.6 ，  * possibly older versions ， More details and a proof of concept including source code is available here :  ， -of-arguments-of-NtOpenSection.php ， Regards ,  ， David Matousek ， Founder and Chief Representative of Matousec - Transparent security",
