In this case , the single quote character is not ， escaped. ， I. Description ， The list of standard functions for threads includes a typical feature ， called \"quick reply\". For user convenience , each post has a button that ， jumps to the form field allowing to send a quick reply , whilst changing ， the topic text of the reply at the top of this form. This is accomplished ， using javascript and the topic that is replied to. The source code for ， this button looks like this :  ， <a href=\" # message\" onclick=\"QuickReply ( '24' , 'Re : Some thread topic' )  ; \"> ， <img src=\"/forum/mvnplugin/mvnforum/images/icon/button_quick_reply.gif\" ， border=\"0\" alt=\"Quick reply to this post\" title=\"Quick reply to this post\" /></a> ， Because single quotes are not escaped in the topic context , it is possible ， to break out of the second argument and execute arbitrary javascript code ， in the client's browser. ， II. Impact ， Any user that is allowed to post anywhere can use this flaw to steal ， sensitive information such as cookies from other users. Especially ， because the forum uses simple reusable MD5 hashes in their cookies ,  ， this attack makes it possible to gain unauthorized access to other ， user accounts. ， However , this attack relies on the user to click the quick reply ， button and should therefore be considered only a moderate risk. ， III. Proof of concept ， Creating a new thread or replying to a thread with the following subject ， will demonstrate the problem after hitting the \"quick reply\" button above ， the post text. ， Test' , alert ( 'XSS ALERT' )  , ' ， IV. Solution ， At the time of writing , a fix is available in CVS. ， vnforum/user/viewthread.jsp?r1=1.316&r2=1.317",
