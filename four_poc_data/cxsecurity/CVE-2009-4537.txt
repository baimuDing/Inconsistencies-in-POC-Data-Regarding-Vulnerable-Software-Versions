This was done in commit fdd7b4c3302c93f6833e338903ea77245eb510b4. A ， long time prior to that however , Francois posted ， 126fa4b9ca5d9d7cb7d46f779ad3bd3631ca387c , which expiclitly disabled the MaxSize ， setting due to the fact that the hardware behaved in odd ways when overlong ， frames were received on NIC's supported by this driver. This was mentioned in a ， security conference recently :  ， It seems that if we can't enable frame size filtering , then , as Eric correctly ， noticed , we can find ourselves DMA-ing too much data to a buffer , causing ， corruption. As a result is seems that we are forced to allocate a frame which ， is ready to handle a maximally sized receive. ， I've not tested the below patch at all , and clearly it stinks to have to do. ， But I thought it would be worth posting to solicit comments on it. ， Thanks & Regards ， Neil ， Signed-off-by : Neil Horman <nhorman @ tuxdriver.com> ， r8169.c | 11 +- ， 1 file changed , 6 insertions ( + )  , 5 deletions ( - )  ， diff -git a/drivers/net/r8169.c b/drivers/net/r8169.c ， index 60f96c4.42e3b22 100644 ， - a/drivers/net/r8169.c ， + b/drivers/net/r8169.c ， -63 , 6 +63 , 7 static const int multicast_filter_limit = 32 ; ",
