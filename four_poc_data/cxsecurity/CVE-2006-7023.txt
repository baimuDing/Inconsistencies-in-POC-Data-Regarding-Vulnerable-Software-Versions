    "text": "vul_name : fx-APP Version 0.0.8.1 ， vul_cve : CVE-2006-7022 , CVE-2006-7023 ， vul_poc : fx-APP Version 0.0.8.1 ， Homepage :  ， Effected files :  ， search input box ， index.cgi ， input boxes on your profile ， adding a menu item ， I noticed there was already several BID's on the a script WebAPP :  ， ebapp&x=22&y=2 ， However , none on these were on a recently new cgi script called fx-APP , which looks similar to webAPP and as their ， homepage says :  ， \"fx-APP is A Practical Perl content management system and portal written in Perl/CGI. fx-APP is up to par with Web standards so that it is more useable and multi-browser friendly. Includes mods , plugins/addons , etc. fx-APP utilises a flat file , so SQL database is not necessary. Easy to use and setup in a matter of minutes. fx-APP is Open source , licensed under GNU/GPL and free to download and use.\" ， so I decided to submit with what I could find. ， fx-APP has a module called Tools , now the url of this module in the browser bar is :  ， ools.htm ， Upon testing that I was able to find you can visit any page on any offsite domain , much like using a content wrapper. In a way this could be harmful , because if a malicious user wanted to load up ascript on another site , he could , and he would still be on the fx-APP site because the page loads in an iframe. Poc :  ， e.js ， XSS Vulnerabilities :  ， When inputting the [ iframe ] tag in the search box I noticed its converted to [ yframe ] and javascript is converted to javascrypt , so one way of bypassing this is to use thedecimal value of javascript. For PoC put this in the search box :  ， <IMG SRC=javascript : alert ( 'XSS' ) > ， Profile input box XSS vulnerabilities :  ， Data in the profile boxes such as url , website , comment , signature etc are not properally filtered. This could lead ， toauser creating an XSS attack. One way tobypass these filters , much like the way above , we convert the word ， javascript into its decimal equivlent and addafew closing and opening tags :  ， For PoC try putting the following in the url , website , comment or signature box :  ， '>'><IMG SRC=javascript : alert ( 'XSS' ) ><'<' ， Now if you'd like to see a XSS example on the same screen as editing your profile just put in :  ， <\"><\"><IMG SRC=javascript : alert ( 'XSS' ) ><\"><\" ， > ， and when you hit edit profile , you will notice the popup on that page again as well. ， Adding a menu item XSS vulnerability :  ， Userinput isn't correctly filtered here either , whena user logs in , he can go to \"Edit My Menu\" , and then \"Add Menu Item\" , in thes einput boxes auser can put :  ， <IMG SRC=javascript : alert ( 'XSS' ) >",
