It is NOT a newer version - it ， is a completely new library. Imlib 2 can be installed alongside ， Imlib 1.x without any problems since they are effectively different ， libraries which have very similar functionality.\" ， Product Link :  ， 4 ) Description of Vulnerability ， Secunia Research has discovered two vulnerabilities in imlib2 , which ， can be exploited by malicious people to cause a DoS ( Denial of ， Service ) or compromise an application using the library. ， 1 ) A boundary error exists within the \"load (  ) \" function in ， src/modules/loaders/loader_pnm.c when processing the header of a ， PNM image file. This can be exploited to cause a stack-based buffer ， overflow by e.g. tricking a user into opening a specially crafted ， PNM image in an application using the imlib2 library. ， Successful exploitation allows execution of arbitrary code. ， 2 ) A boundary error exists within the \"load (  ) \" function in ， src/modules/loader_xpm.c when processing an XPM image file. This can ， be exploited to cause a stack-based buffer overflow by e.g. tricking ， a user into opening a specially crafted XPM image with an application ， using the imlib2 library. ， Successful exploitation may allow execution of arbitrary code. ， 5 ) Solution ， Fixed in the CVS repository. ， 6 ) Time Table ， 27/05/2008 - Vendor notified. ， 27/05/2008 - Vendor response. ， 29/05/2008 - Public disclosure. ， 7 ) Credits ， Discovered by Stefan Cornelius , Secunia Research. ， 8 )  ， The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures ( CVE ) project has assigned ， CVE-2008-2426 for these vulnerabilities. ， 9 ) About Secunia ， Secunia offers vulnerability management solutions to corporate ， customers with verified and reliable vulnerability intelligence ， relevant to their specific system configuration :  ， Secunia also provides a publicly accessible and comprehensive advisory ， database as a service to the security community and private ， individuals , who are interested in or concerned about IT-security. ， Secunia believes that it is important to support the community and to ， do active vulnerability research in order to aid improving the ， security and reliability of software in general :  ， Secunia regularly hires new skilled team members.
