    "text": "vul_name : Ganeti Insecure Archive Permission ， vul_cve : CVE-2014-5247 ， vul_poc :  # 2014-006 Ganeti insecure archive permission ， Description :  ， Ganeti , an open source virtualisation manager , suffers from an insecure file ， permission vulnerability that leads to sensitive information disclosure. ， The Ganeti upgrade command 'gnt-cluster upgrade' creates an archive of the ， current configuration of the cluster ( e.g. the contents of ， '/var/lib/ganeti' ) . The archive is named following the pattern ganet * .tar ， and is written to '/var/lib/'. Such archives are written with too lax ， permissions that make it possible to access them as unprivileged user. ， The configuration archive contains sensitive information , including SSL keys ， remote API ( RAPI ) . Such information can be used to control various operations ， of the cluster , including shutting down and removing instances and nodes from ， the cluster , or assuming the identity of the cluster in a MITM attack. ， This vulnerability only affects Ganeti clusters meeting the following ， criterias :  ，  * The cluster is running Ganeti version 2.10.0 or higher. ，  * The upgrade command was run , for example when upgrading from 2.10 to ， 2.11. ，  * Unprivileged users have access to the host machines and in particular ， to the cluster master. ， In the fixed releases the upgrade command sets the permissions of the ， archives properly. However , in case previous versions have created an unsafe ， archive already , the following mitigations are advised :  ，  * Remove the access to the archive for unprivileged users ( for example ， by running 'chmod 400 /var/lib/ganeti * .tar' ) . ，  * Renew the SSL keys by running 'gnt-cluster renew-crypto'. You may need ， to pass the -new-cluster-certificate , -new-confd-hmac-key ,  ， -new-rapi-certificate , -new-spice-certificate and ， -new-cluster-domain-secret flags. ，  * Renew the RAPI credentials by editing the '/var/lib/ganeti/rapi_users' ， file. Note that this will need to be updated in any out-of-the-cluster ， RAPI client. ，  * Look for any other information regarded as secret in '/var/lib/ganeti' ， and change it. For example VNC and SPICE passwords are not by default ， kept there , but could , if Ganeti is so configured. ， Affected version :  ， Ganeti >= 2.10.0 , <= 2.10.6 ， Ganeti >= 2.11.0 , <= 2.11.4 ， Fixed version :  ， Ganeti >= 2.10.7 ， Ganeti >= 2.11.5 ， Credit : vulnerability report , PoC received from Ganeti authors Helga Velroyen ， <helgav AT google.com> and Guido Trotter <ultrotter AT google.com> ,  ， patch created by Apollon Oikonomopoulos. ， CVE : N/A",
