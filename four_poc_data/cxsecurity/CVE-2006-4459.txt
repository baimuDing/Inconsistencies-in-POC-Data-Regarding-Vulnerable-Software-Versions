BACKGROUND ， AnywhereUSB/5 provides five USB ports , which deliver the same Plug and Play ， user experience as onboard USB ports. ， Software drivers are loaded onto a host PC or server , enabling remote devices ， to communicate with the host , without changing existing application software. ， Peripheral devices can be centrally managed and monitored from a remote ， server or PC via an IP address. ， II. DESCRIPTION ， This low-risk vulnerability in AnywhereUSB/5 1.80.00 allows an attacker to ， forge an AnywhereUSB server , so that if a client connects to it , it can be ， hit with a denial of service attack. ， This integer overflow in version 1.80.00 of AnywhereUSB/5 drivers package ， distributed for Windows NT 4.0/2000/XP and 2003. could allow attackers to ， Bugcheck ( BSOD ) currently connected clients on demand , or any new client upon ， connection. ， The problem exists within the parsing of USB string descriptors. ， A malformed string descriptor that in its header specifies a size of 1 byte ,  ， will cause a memory copy loop to go behind allocated memory range. ， This will result in a Bugcheck ( BSOD ) within the client computer driver. ， III. ANALYSIS ， Successful exploitation allows an attacker to crash the client computer and ， cause a Bugcheck ( BSOD ) on demand. ， Exploitation is possible in two ways : by sending a specially crafted string ， descriptor to the client or by attaching a maliciously crafted USB device to ， the hub. ， IV. DETECTION ， Safend has confirmed that AnywhereUSB/5 drivers version 1.80.00 is vulnerable. ， It is suspected that earlier versions of AnywhereUSB/5 may also vulnerable. ， V. WORKAROUND ， Avoid plugging unknown USB devices into an AnywhereUSB/5 hub. ， Apply strict firewalls rules , to prevent clients from connecting to a ， malicious AnywhereUSB/5 server , which could in turn send the malformed string ， descriptor to the client via TCP/IP. ， VI. VENDOR RESPONSE ， SecuriTeam was asked to assist the researchers with contacting Digi ， International. ， Reported to vendor : 24th of July , 2006. ， Vendor response : 25th of July , 2006. ， Vendor's official response :  ， \"The AnywhereUSB product is used with commercial USB peripheral devices on ， dedicated point to point IP connections , almost always on non-public local ， area networks. The likelihood of any such USB device producing a USB ， descriptor corrupted in precisely this way is extremely unlikely. This error ， will be corrected in a future driver release.\" ， VII. CVE INFORMATION ， The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures ( CVE ) project has assigned the ， name CVE-2006-4459 to this issue. ， VIII.
