One component ， of the Rescue and Recovery system is a file system filter driver which ， monitors new file writes/reads. ， There is a heap overflow in the file system filter kernel driver which ， could allow an attacker to overwrite kernel memory leading to elevation ， of privilege. ， Details :  ， The tvtumon.sys driver serves as a file system filter driver which ， monitors for file creation or changes. Recent lookups are cached within ， a kernel lookaside list. If an overly long filename is passed through ， the filesystem , then a buffer within the lookaside list will overflow ,  ， leading to kernel memory corruption. ， A low privileged user can trigger this corruption from user mode and ， potentially escalate privileges to act as part of the kernel. In the ，  ( unlikely ) event that a web browser plugin allows opening of long ， filenames , there is a chance the corruption could be triggered through a ， web page. ， Fix Information :  ， Lenovo has issued a patch and advisory :  ， Thanks to :  ， Dave Challener , Derek Callaway , Troy Bollinger ， About iSEC Partners :  ， iSEC Partners is a full-service security consulting firm that provides ， penetration testing , secure systems development , security education and ， software design verification , with offices in San Francisco , Seattle ,  ， and Ewa Beach. ， info ( at ) isecpartners ( dot ) com [ email concealed ] ",
