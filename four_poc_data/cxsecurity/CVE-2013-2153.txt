Distributors of older versions should apply ， the ， patches from this subversion revision :  ， Applications that appropriately examine the content of the signatures ， they accept are immune to this issue. The only API provided for ， this purpose in the library is to examine the individual ， elements to enforce limitations over their content , and doing so will ， prevent this vulnerability. Developers with questions about this should ， inquire on the Santuario project's mailing list. ， Credit : This issue was reported by James Forshaw , Context Information ， Security",
