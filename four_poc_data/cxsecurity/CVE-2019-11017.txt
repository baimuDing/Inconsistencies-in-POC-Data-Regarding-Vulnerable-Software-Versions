To inject malicious JavaScript to victim's webpage , an attacker should authorize on the router , then put a payload to any of the vulnerable forms , and wait , until victim opens router's web interface and goes to vulnerable page. ， I haven't tested all the admin panel of the router , so I can guess that there are other XSS vulnerabilities in this router.",
