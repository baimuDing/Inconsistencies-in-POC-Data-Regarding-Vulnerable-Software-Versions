It is ， possible to replace the normal encrypted RDZ file with a specially ， crafted RDZ file. The first file in this archive will be executed with ， current user privledges by the R-Viewer application based strictly on file ， extension alone. ， To further compound this issue it may be possible for an attacker to gain ， other sensitive information from the R-Viewer application through easily ， predictable temporary directories that don't appear to expire content ， regularily. Included inside of these temorary directories are the unecnrypted ， copies of the documents the R-Viewer application has opened in the past. ， Example: ， C:\\Program Files\\RemoteDocs\\Viewer\\tmp\\31325193(1) <- First opening ， C:\\Program Files\\RemoteDocs\\Viewer\\tmp\\31325193(2) <- Second opening"
