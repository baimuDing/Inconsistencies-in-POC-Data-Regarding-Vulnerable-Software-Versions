    "text": "vul_name : MyProxy SSL Certificate Validation Security Bypass Vulnerability ， vul_cve : CVE-2011-0738 ， vul_poc : Globus Security Advisory 2011-01 : myproxy-logon identity checking of server ， Original issue date : January 18 2011 ， Last revised : None ， Software affected : MyProxy v5.0 4 Dec 2009 ， MyProxy v5.1 9 Mar 2010 ， MyProxy v5.2 22 Jun 2010 ， Globus Toolkit 5.0.0 , 5.0.1 , and 5.0.2 ， Overview :  ， The myproxy-logon program in MyProxy versions 5.0 through 5.2 does not ， enforce the check that the myproxy-server's certificate contains the ， expected hostname or identity. The impacted MyProxy versions are ， included in Globus Toolkit releases 5.0.0-5.0.2. This issue is ， addressed in MyProxy 5.3. ， I. Description ， The myproxy-logon program ( also called myproxy-get-delegation ) in ， MyProxy versions 5.0 through 5.2 does not abort connections when it ， finds that the myproxy-server's certificate is valid and signed by a ， trusted certification authority but the certificate does not contain ， the expected hostname ( or identity given in the MYPROXY_SERVER_DN ， environment variable )  , unless the myproxy-logon -T or myproxy-logon -b ， options are given. ， Other MyProxy programs and libraries , including jGlobus MyProxy , are ， not impacted. The issue is specific to the myproxy-logon and ， myproxy-get-delegation programs in MyProxy versions 5.0 through 5.2. ， II. Impact ， The myproxy-logon program may be tricked into connecting to a ， man-in-the-middle or malicious myproxy-server , through DNS hijacking ， or similar attacks , potentially resulting in disclosure of the MyProxy ， password and download of a malicious end entity or proxy certificate ， by myproxy-logon. ， III. Solution ， MyProxy 5.3 , which addresses this issue , is available for download from :  ， Upgrade instructions are available at :  ， Use 'myproxy-logon -V' to determine your installed MyProxy version :  ，  $ myproxy-logon -V ， myproxy-logon version MYPROXYv2 ( v5.2 22 Jun 2010 PAM OCSP )  ， IV.
