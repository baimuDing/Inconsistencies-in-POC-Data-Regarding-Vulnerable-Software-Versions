Due to popular demand , I decided to publish a ， short writeup of the talk. ， = What is MIME? = ， MIME is the standard format for email-messages. One could say , MIME is for ， email , what html is for the web. The first RFC for MIME was published in ， 1992 , RFC 1341. The current standard is specified in RFC 2045 from 1996. ， MIME is a recursive data format. MIME objects consist of a header and a ， body , where the content-type field of the header specifies the type of the ， body. The body can consist of several separated MIME-objects , a single ， MIME-object , a block of text , an encoded image or about anything specified ， in the header. It is possible to read some real-world examples by opening ， some emails and hitting \"show source\". ， = Two examples to illustrate MIME = ， The first example is the content-type : message/rfc822 , which is intended for ， forwarding emails. The following body is a complete email , which starts ， again with a header , followed by a body. The second example is the ， content-type : multipart/mixed. A pretty much self-explanatory example is ， provided below. The parts of the body are separated by strcat ( \"-\" ,  ， boundary ) and the body must be ended by strcat ( \"-\" , boundary , \"-\" ) . ， From : <bruhns @ hell> ， To : <foo @ bar> ， Subject : example ， MIME-Version : 1.0 ， Content-Type : multipart/mixed ; boundary=\"n\" ， -n ， content-type : text/plain ， this is some plain text. ， -n ， content-type : message/rfc822 ， From : <bruhns @ hell> ;  ， Subject : example 2 ， This is not a MIME-mail , since the mime-version field is missing ! However ,  ， most software does not care. ， -n- ， = The problem = ， Even though MIME is pretty old , many people have not yet learned how to ， parse MIME correctly. The problem is that the number of MIME-parts of an ， email and the depth of recursion is potentially unlimited. Some software ， like the popular rfc2045 library of the courier-mta solve this problem by ， discarding mails with too many MIME-parts as a Denial of Service attack. ， This is probably the best approach to handle this problem.",
