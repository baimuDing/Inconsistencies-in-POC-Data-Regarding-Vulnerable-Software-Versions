When this many IDs are supplied , the server ， takes around 60 seconds to respond and successfully generate the ， expected ZIP archive ( during this time period , no other pages load ) . A ， threat actor could issue a request to this endpoint with 100+ statement ， IDs every 30 seconds , potentially resulting in an overload of the ， server for all users. ，  [ VulnerabilityType Other ]  ， Denial of Service ，  [ Vendor of Product ]  ， ebankIT ，  [ Affected Product Code Base ]  ， ebankIT - Omnichannel Digital Banking Platform - Version 6 , patched in version 7 ，  [ Affected Component ]  ， The endpoint existing at /Controls/Generic/EBMK/Handlers/EStatements/DownloadEStatement.ashx?EStatementsIds= * id *  ,  * id *  ,  * id *  , etc ，  [ Attack Type ]  ， Remote ，  [ Impact Denial of Service ]  ， true ，  [ Attack Vectors ]  ， I discovered it was possible to perform a Denial-of-Service attack on ， the ebankIT platform , potentially resulting in a single user rendering ， the entire application inaccessible. The vulnerable endpoint exists on ， /Controls/Generic/EBMK/Handlers/EStatements/DownloadEStatement.ashx ， and the EStatementsIds GET parameter accepts over 100 ， comma-separated e-statement IDs without throwing an error. When this ， many IDs are supplied , the server takes around 60 seconds to respond ， and successfully generate the expected zip file ( during this 60 ， seconds , no other pages load ) . A threat actor could issue a request to ， this endpoint with 100+ statement ID s every 30 seconds , potentially ， resulting in overloading the server for all users of the ebankIT ， platform. I believe this is being caused by a thread commitment issue ， where there are no dedicated threads to individual processes. ，  [ Discoverer ]  ， Jake Murphy",
