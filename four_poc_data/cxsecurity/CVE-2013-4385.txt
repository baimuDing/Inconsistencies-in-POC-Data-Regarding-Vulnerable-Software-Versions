It affects a very particular, not very common use ， of the read-string! procedure. If given a buffer and #f (the Scheme ， value for \"false\") as the buffer's size (which should trigger automatic ， size detection but doesn't), it will read beyond the buffer, until the ， input port (file, socket, etc) is exhausted. This may result in the ， typical potential remote code execution or denial of service; in ， CHICKEN, these buffers are initially allocated on the stack and moved ， to the heap upon GC. ， In normal usage, users would usually pass in the buffer's size. This ， is also the workaround for this bug. ， For the official announcement, see ， The discussion thread's final accepted patch is at ， which got applied as ， All versions of CHICKEN prior to 4.8.0.5 and 4.8.3 (not yet released) ， are affected. ， Cheers, ， Peter Bex"
