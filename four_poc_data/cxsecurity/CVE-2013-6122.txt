The issues were found in the write handler of the ， procfs entry created by the driver, which by default is readable and ， writeable to users without any specific privileges. ， CVE-2013-4740 ， When processing data written to the procfs file, the Goodix gt915 ， touchscreen driver is using user space supplied content as length ， values in subsequent memory manipulation operations without ， bounds checking. This can lead to multiple memory corruption issues. ， An application with access to the respective file can use this flaw ， to, e.g., elevate privileges. ， Access Vector: local ， Security Risk: high ， Vulnerability: CWE-20 (Improper Input Validation) ， CVE-2013-6122 ， When processing arguments passed to the procfs write handler of ， the Goodix gt915 touchscreen driver, user space data is copied to ， a global variable and used without a mutual-exclusion mechanism. ， The global structure used by the procfs write handler can be accessed ， concurrently by more than one process. This would allow local attackers ， to bypass the input validation checks (such as introduced by the fix for ， CVE-2013-4740). An application with access to the respective file can use ， this flaw to, e.g., alter the internal state of the handler, bypass security ， checks, or create a denial-of-service condition. ， Access Vector: local ， Security Risk: medium ， Vulnerability: CWE-362 (Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource ， with Improper Synchronization) ， Affected versions ， All Android releases from CAF using a Linux kernel from the following heads: ， - jb_3* ， - msm-3.10 ， Patch ， We advise customers to apply the following patches: ， Acknowledgement ， Qualcomm Innovation Center, Inc. (QuIC) thanks Jonathan Salwan of the ， Sysdream Security Lab for reporting the related issues and working with ， QuIC to help improve Android device security."
