    "text": "vul_name : Apache Hadoop Man in the Middle Vulnerability ， vul_cve : CVE-2013-2192 ， vul_poc : CVE-2013-2192 : Apache Hadoop Man in the Middle Vulnerability ， Severity : Severe ， Vendor : The Apache Software Foundation ， Versions Affected :  ， All versions of Hadoop 2.x prior to Hadoop 2.0.6-alpha. ， All versions of Hadoop 0.23.x prior to Hadoop 0.23.9. ， All versions of Hadoop 1.x prior to Hadoop 1.2.1. ， Users affected : Users who have enabled Hadoop's Kerberos security features. ， Impact : RPC traffic from clients , potentially including authentication ， credentials , may be intercepted by a malicious user with access to run ， tasks or containers on a cluster. ， Description :  ， The Apache Hadoop RPC protocol is intended to provide bidirectional ， authentication between clients and servers. However , a malicious server or ， network attacker can unilaterally disable these authentication checks. This ， allows for potential reduction in the configured quality of protection of ， the RPC traffic , and privilege escalation if authentication credentials are ， passed over RPC. ， Mitigation :  ， Users of Hadoop 1.x versions should immediately upgrade to 1.2.1 or later. ， Users of Hadoop 0.23.x versions should immediately upgrade to 0.23.9 or ， later. ， Users of Hadoop 2.x versions prior to 2.0.6-alpha should immediately ， upgrade to 2.0.6-alpha or later. ， Credit : This issue was discovered by Kyle Leckie of Microsoft and Aaron T. ， Myers of Cloudera.",
