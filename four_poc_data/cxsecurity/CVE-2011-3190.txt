    "text": "vul_name : Apache Tomcat Authentication bypass and information disclosure ， vul_cve : CVE-2011-3190 ， vul_poc : CVE-2011-3190 Apache Tomcat Authentication bypass and information disclosure ， Severity : Important ， Vendor : The Apache Software Foundation ， Versions Affected :  ， - Tomcat 7.0.0 to 7.0.20 ， - Tomcat 6.0.0 to 6.0.33 ， - Tomcat 5.5.0 to 5.5.33 ， - Earlier , unsupported versions may also be affected ， Description :  ， Apache Tomcat supports the AJP protocol which is used with reverse ， proxies to pass requests and associated data about the request from the ， reverse proxy to Tomcat. The AJP protocol is designed so that when a ， request includes a request body , an unsolicited AJP message is sent to ， Tomcat that includes the first part ( or possibly all ) of the request ， body. In certain circumstances , Tomcat did not process this message as a ， request body but as a new request. This permitted an attacker to have ， full control over the AJP message which allowed an attacker to ( amongst ， other things )  :  ， - insert the name of an authenticated user ， - insert any client IP address ( potentially bypassing any client IP ， address filtering )  ， - trigger the mixing of responses between users ， The following AJP connector implementations are not affected :  ， org.apache.jk.server.JkCoyoteHandler ( 5.5.x - default , 6.0.x - default )  ， The following AJP connector implementations are affected :  ， org.apache.coyote.ajp.AjpProtocol ( 6.0.x , 7.0.x - default )  ， org.apache.coyote.ajp.AjpNioProtocol ( 7.0.x )  ， org.apache.coyote.ajp.AjpAprProtocol ( 5.5.x , 6.0.x , 7.0.x )  ， Further , this issue only applies if all of the following are are true ， - POST requests are accepted ， - The request body is not processed ， Example : See ， Mitigation :  ， Users of affected versions should apply one of the following mitigations :  ， - Upgrade to a version of Apache Tomcat that includes a fix for this ， issue when available ， - Apply the appropriate patch ， - 7.0.x ， - 6.0.x ， - 5.5.x ， - Configure the reverse proxy and Tomcat's AJP connector ( s ) to use the ， requiredSecret attribute ， - Use the org.apache.jk.server.JkCoyoteHandler AJP connector ( not ， available for Tomcat 7.0.x )  ， Credit :  ， The issue was reported via Apache Tomcat's public issue tracker. ， The Apache Tomcat security team strongly discourages reporting of ， undisclosed vulnerabilities via public channels. All Apache Tomcat ， security vulnerabilities should be reported to the private security team ， mailing list : security ( at ) tomcat.apache ( dot ) org [ email concealed ] ",
