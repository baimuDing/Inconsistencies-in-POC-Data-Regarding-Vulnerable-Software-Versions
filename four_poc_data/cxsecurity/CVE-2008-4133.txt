INTRODUCTION ， D-Link DIR-100 is a small and cost-effective router and firewall device ， official product web site ( German link )  :  ， gqltbNlwaaFp6DQoHDrpxC5H+40AAdvl ， II. DESCRIPTION ， Marc Ruef at scip AG found a possibility to evade url filters of the web ， proxy to prevent access to web sites. ， An attacker might add a very long string to the url to access web ， resources althought their access is forbidden. ， This problem could be verified in all firmware versions up to v1.12. ， A similar vulnerability was already detected years ago in a similar ， device Netgear RP114. [ 1 , 2 ]  ， III. EXPLOITATION ， It is possible to exploit the vulnerability with a common web browser by ， using a long url ( approx. 1'300 chars ) . You can expand the length of the ， url by adding a non-used http get request parameter. Example url :  ， A video illustrating this issue is available at the following url :  ， The Attack Tool Kit ( ATK )  [ 3 ] is able to exploit this vulnerability with ， the following generic ASL code ( expand the long URL request )  :  ， open | send GET ， HTTP/1.0\\n\\n | sleep | close | pattern_not_exists * This URL is <font ， color=red>blocked</font> by administrator !  *  ， IV. IMPACT ， With this vulnerability users are able to access forbidden web resources ， without being filtered by the integrated web proxy service. ， V. DETECTION ， Detection of web based attacks requires a specialized web proxy and/or ， intrusion detection system. Patterns for such a detection are available ， and easy to implement. ， VI. SOLUTION ， We have informed D-Link on an early stage. Our technical requests were ， not answered nor confirmed. Therefore , not official statement , patch or ， upgrade is available. ， We suggest the use of another device for filtering forbidden web ， resources successfully. ， VII. VENDOR RESPONSE ， D-Link has been informed first via the unhandy web form at ，  ( no public mail address for such cases could be ， found ) . The first responses claimed that the problem must be within a ， wrong configuration setting. Further discussions were initiated. ， The support was not able to understand the problem. Not even after ， several step-by-step guides and examples. They always suggest I have to ， upgrade to the latest firmware and they could not verify the problem. ， Therefore , no official solution , workaround or patch is available. ， VIII.
