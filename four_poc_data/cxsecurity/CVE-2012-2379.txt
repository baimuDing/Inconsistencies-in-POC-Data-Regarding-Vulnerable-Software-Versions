For example, the following policy requires that (the ， private ， key associated with) an X.509 Token sign the WS-Addressing \"To\" header. CXF ， currently checks to see whether the header was signed, but not by a X.509 ， Token in particular: ， <sp:SupportingToken> ， <sp:X509Token sp:IncludeToken=\".\">.</sp:X509Token> ， <sp:SignedParts> ， <sp:Header Name=\"To\" Namespace=\" ， /> ， </sp:SignedParts> ， </sp:SupportingToken> ， Note that this applies for both WS-SecurityPolicy 1.1 and 1.2 policies. ， This has been fixed in revision: ， All released versions of CXF are affected. ， Migration: ， Users of CXF prior to 2.4.x should upgrade to either 2.4.8, 2.5.4, or 2.6.1. ， CXF 2.4.5 to 2.4.7 users should upgrade to 2.4.8 as soon as possible. ， CXF 2.5.1 to 2.5.3 users should upgrade to 2.5.4 as soon as possible. ， CXF 2.6.0 users should upgrade to 2.6.1 as soon as possible."
