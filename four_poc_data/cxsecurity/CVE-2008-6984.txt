    "text": "vul_name : Plesk 8.6.0 authentication flaw allows to gain virtual user priviledges ， vul_cve : CVE-2008-6984 ， vul_poc : Hello ,  ， the reported vulnerability allows logins to mail and probably other services protected by plesk authentication modules on at least the current Plesk 8.6.0 Unix/Linux and could eg. be used for relaying spam through gained smtp auth priviledges. ， Only systems which allow short mail login names ( SHORTNAMES=1 ) are affected , which is not the default but is eg. effective after migrating from Confix control panel or by administrators manual choice. ， My curent advice is to disable short login names through control panel under Server -> E-Mail until the issue is resolved. ， NOTICE : I have tried to contact Parallels about this issue by E-Mail to ， bugreport ( at ) parallels ( dot ) com [ email concealed ]  , bugreports ( at ) parallels ( dot ) com [ email concealed ] and ， abuse ( at ) parallels ( dot ) com. [ email concealed ] With the E-Mail to bugreport and abuse being ， bounced and to bugreports being ignored. ， Tries to contact through web support form were unsuccessful because my plesk license is subcontracted from a serviced provide , so I see no other choice than gaining attention to this issue by releasing it to a security related mailing list. ， Below is the full Mail I sent to Parallels about this issue :  ， -snip- ， Hello ,  ， I have discovered severe security flaws in Plesk 8.6.0 regarding the SHORTNAMES=1 feature for E-Mail logins , that could easily lead to compromised accounts and spam relaying. ， The bugs could be reproduced on an existing Plesk 8.6.0 system with data migrated from older Plesk Versions and originall from Confix aswell as on a fresh test install of Plesk 8.6.0 both on OpenSUSE 10.3 x86_64 and using psa autoinstaller. ，  ( 1 ) If SHORTNAMES=1 is active for smtp_psa or smtps_psa in xinetd , QMAIL will accept ANY correctly base64 encoded username which begins with a valid shortname or equals a valid password during AUTH LOGIN authentication. This is only fixed by completely removing SHORTNAMES=1 from smtp ( s ) _psa , simply setting it to 0 has no effect.",
