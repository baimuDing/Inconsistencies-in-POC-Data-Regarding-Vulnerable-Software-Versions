The module uses an unusual method to register AJAX actions , adding an admin_init listener in its constructor that first checks whether or not a request was to the AJAX endpoint and contains a valid nonce before calling the maybe_handle_ajax function. ， Unfortunately no capability checks were used in the vulnerable versions. There are a number of ways for an authenticated user to obtain the Ajax : NONCE_KEY , but one of the simplest ways is to view the source of the admin dashboard as a logged-in user , as it is present for all authenticated users , even for subscriber-level users.",
