Under normal circumstances ,  ， SharePoint does not permit users to include javascript in any submitted ， content. ， Impact ， If javascript is enabled in a user's browser , when the user views the ， page , the javascript will be executed. As a result , an attacker could ， potentially steal credentials and takeover the browser or machine of any ， user who views the page. ， Affected Systems ， Microsoft Windows Share Point Services 2.0 ， Technical Explanation ， The string below is not properly sanitized when the web page is saved ， after adding a picture using the application's text editor :  ， \"></P></div></td><script>alert ( \"bingo\" )  ; </script> ， The text between the script tags will be injected into the page upon ， each successful edit and save operation , after the page is initially ， saved. On initial testing , there did not appear to be a size limit for ， javascript text that could be injected. The string must also use all ， double quotes when quotes are needed. ， Solution & Recommendations ， Unless editing web pages in SharePoint 2.0 is necessary , disable this ， feature. If the feature is necessary , ensure users must authenticate to ， a service before giving them the privilege to create or edit pages , and ， only afford users the privileges if they need to create or edit pages. ， This practice will help leave an audit trail to determine which account ， was used to create a malicious web page if an incident takes place. ， Exploitation",
