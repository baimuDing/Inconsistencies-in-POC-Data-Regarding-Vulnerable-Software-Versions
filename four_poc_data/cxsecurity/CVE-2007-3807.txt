INTRODUCTION ， SiteScape forum is a commercial web forum. It uses presence to connect ， teams through phone , IM , chat , SMS and email , as well as voice- and ， web-conferencing. The application also supports online threaded ， discussions and creation of content through blogs , wikis and ， workflow-driven document and task management. ， More information is available at the official web site at the following URL :  ， II. DESCRIPTION ， Marc Ruef at scip AG found an input validation error within SiteScape ， Forum prior release 7.3. ， Some scripts that are not protected by any authentication procedure can ， be used to run arbitrary script code within a cross site scripting attack. ， Other parts of the application might be affected too. ， III. EXPLOITATION ， Classic script injection techniques and unexpected input data within a ， browser session can be used to exploit this vulnerabilities. ， The simple approach to verify an insecure installation is within the ， login procedure. Use the following string as user name and a wrong ， passwort for the simple proof-of-concept [ 1 ]  :  ， <script>alert ( 'scip' )  ; </script> ， A plugin for our open-source exploiting framework \"Attack Tool Kit\" ，  ( ATK ) will be published in the near future. [ 2 ]  ， IV. IMPACT ， Because non-authenticated parts of the software are affected , these ， vulnerabilities are serious for every secure environment. ， Non-authenticated users might be able to exploit this flaw to gain ， elevated privileges ( e.g. extracting sensitive cookie information or ， launch a buffer overflow attack against another web browser ) . ， Because other parts of the application might be affected too - this ， could include some second order vulnerabilities - a severe attack ， scenario might be possible. ， V. DETECTION ， Detection of web based attacks requires a specialized web proxy and/or ， intrusion detection system. Patterns for such a detection are available ， and easy to implement. ， VI. SOLUTION ， We have informed SiteScape on a very early stage. They told us that the ， problem was not announced within a public advisory. But it is already ， solved within the latest release of the discussed software. Therefore ,  ， an upgrade to SiteScape Forum 7.3 or newer will solve the issues. ， VII. VENDOR RESPONSE ， SiteScape has been informed a first time at 06/29/2007 via email at ， info-at-sitescape.com. A very kind reply by Chris Pressley came back ， some minutes later. Further discussion of the flaw ( how to reproduce )  ， and the co-ordination of a public advisory was made. ， VIII.
