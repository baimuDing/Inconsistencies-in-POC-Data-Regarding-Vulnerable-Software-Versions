If a dynamic script with multiple extensions such ， as file.php.pps or file.sh.txt is uploaded and then accessed from a web ， browser under certain common Apache configurations , it will cause the ， script inside to be executed. We deemed this exploit critical and ， released Drupal 4.6.7 and 4.7.1 six hours after the report was filed. ， The fix was to create a .htaccess file to remove all dynamic script ， handlers , such as PHP , from the \"files\" directory. ， After continuous review , however , we've found that the fix will not work ， in certain Apache configurations , for example those for whom .htaccess ， FileInfo overrides are disabled. We are thus releasing 4.6.8 and 4.7.2 ， with a more robust .htaccess fix , as well as a Drupal core solution to ， the issue which will work under all configurations. The new behavior of ， Drupal's upload.module is to rename all uploaded files with multiple ,  ， non-numeric , and non-whitelisted extensions by any other user than the ， administrator. For example :  ， file.php.pps ， this is a long file.name.txt ， becomes :  ， file.php_.pps ， this is a long file.name_.txt ， Please note that the particular Apache configurations under which this ， exploit is possible will affect ANY web application on the server which ， allows uploads to web-accessible directories , not just Drupal. The ， Drupal security team has also contacted other projects , such as ， WordPress , about this issue and new versions of their software have ， either already been released , or are forthcoming. ， 4.7.2 also fixes a potential XSS bug with upload.module. ， Versions affected ， All Drupal versions before 4.6.8 and before Drupal 4.7.2. ， Solution ， If you are running Drupal 4.6.x then upgrade to Drupal 4.6.8. ， If you are running Drupal 4.7.x then upgrade to Drupal 4.7.2. ， To patch Drupal 4.6.7 use the ， To patch Drupal 4.7.1 use the ， Reported By ， DRUPAL-SA-2006-06 issue : Lourens Veen ， XSS vulnerability in upload.module : Karoly Negyesi ， Contact ， The security contact for Drupal can be reached at security ( at ) drupal ( dot ) org [ email concealed ]  ， or using the form at More information is ， available from or from our security RSS feed ， / Uwe Hermann , on behalf of the Drupal Security Team. ， Uwe Hermann",
