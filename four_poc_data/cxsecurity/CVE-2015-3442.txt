It manages ， all the private information about the employees. Compass Security [ 3 ] found a ， vulnerability that allows an attacker to impersonate other users by only ， knowing the username of the person. With this flaw a user can bypass the ， authentication mechanism and achieve highest privileges to access personal ， information like the salary of any employee or manipulate security settings ，  ( e.g. accounts ) of the application. ， Affected :  ， Xpert.Line Version 3.0 ( Xpert.Center ) . Other versions have not been tested. ， Vulnerability Description :  ， Xpert.Line has several authentication mechanisms to authenticate the user to the ， application. One of the authentication mechanisms relies only on client-side ， functionalities. When the Xpert.Line Windows client is started , it first ， retrieves the username of the current logged-in Windows user by using an API ， call to \"getUserNameA\" from the Windows built-in library \"advapi32.dll\". ， This information is then sent to the server to authenticate the user to Xpert.Line ， and it is also used for all subsequent requests to the server. ， Impact :  ， A malicious user can impersonate any user by intercepting the above mentioned ， API call to \"getUserNameA\" in \"advapi32.dll\" and change the value returned to ， an arbitrary name. This allows impersonating higher privileged users to access ， sensitive information like salary information or to create new administrator ， accounts. ， Workaround / Fix :  ， The affected authentication mechanism can be deactivated. The vendor currently ， is not willing to remove this authentication mechanism. Instead , vendor offers ， more secure authentication mechanisms and considers this a configuration issue. ， To deactivate the affected unsecure authentication method do the following :  ， 1. Go to Xpert.Security ， 2. Got to \"change environment\" settings ， 3. Change the authentication type to a secure setting ( e.g. LDAPs )  ， Source : Xpert.Security LDAP documentation , received from vendor on 06.03.2015",
