    "text": "vul_name : Apache Cordova 3.5.0 Data Leak ， vul_cve : CVE-2014-3502 ， vul_poc : The following text is amended from the original that was sent on August 4th. More background information on this amendment can be found at ， Android Platform Release : 04 Aug 2014 ， CVE-2014-3502 : Cordova apps can potentially leak data to other apps via URL ， loading ， Severity : Medium ， Vendor :  ， The Apache Software Foundation ， Versions Affected :  ， Cordova Android versions up to 3.5.0 ， Description :  ， Android applications built with the Cordova framework can launch other ， applications through the use of anchor tags , or by redirecting the webview to ， an Android intent URL. An attacker who can manipulate the HTML content of a ， Cordova application can create links which open other applications and send ， arbitrary data to those applications. An attacker who can run arbitrary ， JavaScript code within the context of the Cordova application can also set the ， document location to such a URL. By using this in concert with a second ,  ， vulnerable application , an attacker might be able to use this method to send ， data from the Cordova application to the network. ， The latest release of Cordova Android takes steps to block explicit Android ， intent urls , so that they can no longer be used to start arbitrary applications ， on the device. ， Implicit intents , including URLs with schemes such as \"tel\" , \"geo\" , and \"sms\" ， can still be used to open external applications by default , but this behaviour ， can be overridden by plugins. ， Upgrade path :  ， Developers who are concerned about this should rebuild their applications with ， Cordova Android 3.5.1. ， Credit :  ， This issue was discovered by David Kaplan and Roee Hay of IBM Security Systems.",
