A CVSS v3 base score of 7.5 has been ， assigned ; the CVSS vector string is ( AV : N/AC : L/PR : N/UI : N/S : U/C : N/I : N/A : H ， < ，  ) . ， Exploitation ， Note that this vulnerability targets the VTScada thick client installed on ， the system. Any application user ( including a non-admin , restricted user )  ， who has access to the thick client can potentially bring down the system. ， Payload can be up to ~ 80k characters. Repeated attempts result in spiked ， CPU usage & consumption of RAM / page resources. Where a full-blown ， application ( or multiple applications in production scenario ) is deployed ,  ， i.e. with an operational/functional configuration , memory/CPU usage is ， notably higher than that of a test , blank application. Repeatedly ， submitting such a large username input , rapidly consumes available server ， memory resources leading to resource exhaustion. This forces a system ， reboot eventually. ， Where an endpoint security solution ( such as AV/HIPS/Anti-Malware ) is ， deployed on the system , resource exhaustion may be achieved relatively much ， faster ( quickly ) . ， CROSS-SITE SCRIPTING CWE-79 < ， A cross-site scripting vulnerability may allow JavaScript code supplied by ， the attacker to execute within the useras browser. ， CVE-2017-6053 ， < has been ， assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 6.5 has been ， assigned ; the CVSS vector string is ( AV : N/AC : L/PR : N/UI : R/S : U/C : H/I : N/A : N ， < ，  ) . ， Exploitation ， Multiple URLs and parameters were found to vulnerable to Reflected ， Cross-Site Scripting. ， INFORMATION EXPOSURE CWE-548 ， < ， Some files are exposed within the web server application to unauthenticated ， users. These files may contain sensitive configuration information. ， CVE-2017-6045 ， < has been ， assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.5 has been ， assigned ; the CVSS vector string is ( AV : N/AC : L/PR : N/UI : N/S : U/C : H/I : N/A : N ， < ，  ) . ， +",
