There is a free version , Sugar Community Edition , and two ， commercial versions , Sugar Professional and Sugar Enterprise. ， More Details ， SugarCRM supports defining so-called roles , that have a given set of ， privileges for each object type , such as customers ( called \"accounts\" )  ,  ， calls and opportunities. A role can then be assigned to users , to which ， the defined privileges apply. ， These privileges , among others , include View , Edit , Delete and List. The ， List privilege controls to what extent a list of existing objects can be ， accessed. It may be set to All , Owner or None. When set to Owner , users ， to which this applies can only see the objects they own , such as ， customers assigned to them. ， When trying to create , for example , a new customer , SugarCRM performs a ， duplicate check and warns the user , if a customer using the same name ， already exists. The warning page includes a listing of the conflicting ， entries , regardless of their owner. Furthermore , when reloading the page ， at this point , it shows a complete list of all customers , even if the ， user's List privilege is limited to Owner. Directly accessing the URL of ， this page works in the same way. This likewise applies to contact ， entries , too. ， Proof of Concept ， The following URL displays a list of all customers ( \"accounts\" )  :  ， licates ， The following URL displays a list of all contacts :  ， licates ， Fix ， Upgrade to SugarCRM 6.1.3. ， Security Risk ， This vulnerability enables logged-in users to see the names of ， customers and contact persons , they are not allowed to see. They however ， are not able to otherwise access customer or contact person entries ,  ， such as viewing their details. Thus the risk of this vulnerability is ， estimated as medium. ， The risk in a particular case varies depending on the actual ， confidentiality of customer relationships. ， History ， 2010-09-14 Vulnerability identified ， 2011-01-28 CVE number requested ， 2011-02-02 CVE number assigned ， 2011-02-09 Vendor notified ， 2011-02-09 Vendor confirmed the vulnerability ， 2011-03-10 Vendor releases fix ， 2011-03-15 Advisory released ， RedTeam Pentesting GmbH ， RedTeam Pentesting offers individual penetration tests , short pentests ,  ， performed by a team of specialised IT-security experts.
