    "text": "vul_name : Oracle Demantra 12.2.1 Stored XSS Vulnerability ， vul_cve : CVE-2014-0379 ， vul_poc : Details :  ， The TaskSender area is vulnerable to a stored cross-site scripting vulnerability. ， Impact :  ， An attacker could exploit this flaw to get active HTML or script code executed in an authenticated user& # 8217 ; s browser. Cross-site Scripting may be used to perform attacks such as session hijacking by invoking the user& # 8217 ; s browser to send information stored in their cookies ( such as a session identification token ) to an arbitrary location controlled by the attacker. Furnished with this information the attacker could immediately access the site , masquerading as the authenticated user who viewed the page containing the malicious code. The attacker would then be able to perform actions as the authorised user , subject to their role , which could include viewing sensitive data , modifying profile information and making transactions. ， This vulnerability could also be leveraged in a & # 8220 ; phishing& # 8221 ; attack , whereby the attacker adds additional HTML code to create a false login page within the vulnerable page , which posts the data to a server controlled by the attacker. The attacker could then redirect the user back to the original server , thus giving the illusion that the login was secure and genuine. This could also be achieved by redirecting the user to a false login page on the attacker& # 8217 ; s server rather than adding the code to a page that already exists. This is critical , because if the attacker could host a & # 8220 ; phishing& # 8221 ; website in a domain with a valid SSL certificate , there would be no way for a user to spot the attack. ， A variation of the & # 8220 ; phishing& # 8221 ; attack described above would be to inject code to completely rewrite the genuine page , defacing the site and possibly having a detrimental impact on the reputation of the company. ， Finally , an attacker could use Cross-site Scripting to exploit vulnerabilities within web browsers. The outcome of such an attack would depend on the exploits used , but in a worst case scenario the attacker could gain full control of a user& # 8217 ; s computer. Once that had been achieved it would be trivial for the attacker to install a keystroke logger and gain access to applications via the usernames and passwords they had acquired. ， In the case of the current web application , the Cross-site Scripting was & # 8220 ; reflective& # 8221 ;  , meaning that a user would need to follow a specially crafted link for the attack to be successful. ， Exploit :  ， Request :  ， POST /demantra/TaskSender HTTP/1.1 ， Host : www.target.com : 8080 ， User-Agent : Mozilla/5.0 ( Macintosh ; Intel Mac OS X 10.8 ; rv : 22.0 ) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/22.0",
