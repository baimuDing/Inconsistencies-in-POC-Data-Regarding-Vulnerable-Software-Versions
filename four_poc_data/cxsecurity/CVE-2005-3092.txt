    "text": "vul_name : FL Studio 5 ( .flp file processing ) Heap Overflow ， vul_cve : CVE-2005-3092 ， vul_poc : Release Date : - ， 26th September 2005 ， Severity : - ， High ( Arbitrary Code Execution )  ， Vendor : - ， Image-Line Software ， Vendor Status : - ， Vendor Contacted - No Response ， Systems Affected : - ， Fl Studio v5.0.1 ( Confirmed )  ， Vulnerability may also exist in previous and current versions ， Background : - ， FL Studio is a full-featured sequencer perfectly suited for creation of complex songs and realistic drum loops , with 32 bit internal mixing and advanced MIDI support. ， Vulnerability Details : - ， The FL Studio component in FLEngine.dll , that processes .flp files , is susceptible to a Heap overflow Vulnerability. ?.flp? files are equivalent to project files and are used to store information related to song composition. ， This is a text book Heap overflow scenario and is trivially exploitable. The adversary can manipulate two registers by using overflowed data and thereby control the pointer exchange taking place when heap management routine kicks in. To exploit this he would have to create a ?.flp? file containing the trigger and malicious payload. ， Since this is a closed File format , the vulnerable structure cannot be pin pointed precisely. However the vulnerability definitely exists in code that processes file paths. FL Studio allows inclusion of various .mid or .wav files for use a samples. When a session is saved , the path to these samples is also saved in the .flp file. Manipulating these path names to contain 128 bytes or more triggers the Heap Overflow. ， The vulnerability gets triggered once the user closes the malicious .flp file. This makes it even more deceiving since the application does not crash or exhibit suspicious behavior when the file is opened. ， This issue has been tested and confirmed in FL Studio v5.0.1 on Windows XP SP1. The latest version is FL Studio v5.0.2b. It is highly possible that previous and current versions are also vulnerable. ， Attack Vectors and Impact : - ， In order to exploit this vulnerability an attacker can craft a malicious .flp file containing executable payload and transmit it to a FL studio user over mail or chat. User interaction would be required for opening the file. ， Apart from this FL studio has massive online communities and lists. A malicious .flp file can also be posted in one of these forums to execute a large scale compromise. ， Exploitation of this vulnerability will allow arbitrary code execution with privileges of the user who opened the file.",
