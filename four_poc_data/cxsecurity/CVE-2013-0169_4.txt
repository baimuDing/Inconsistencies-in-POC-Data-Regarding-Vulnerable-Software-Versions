For symmetric key algorithms in CBC mode , the IV for the first record is generated using keys and secrets set during the SSL or TLS handshake. All subsequent records are encrypted using the ciphertext block from the previous record as the IV. With symmetric key encryption in CBC mode , plain text encrypted with the same IV and key generates the same cipher text , which is why having a variable IV is important. ， The BEAST exploit uses this SSLv3 and TLS v1.0 vulnerability by allowing an attacker to observe the last ciphertext block , which is the IV , then replace this with an IV of their choice , inject some of their own plain text data , and when this new IV is used to encrypt the data , the attacker can guess the plain text data one byte at a time. ， Lucky Thirteen ， Researchers have discovered a weakness in the handling of CBC cipher suites in SSL , TLS and DTLS. The Lucky Thirteen attack exploits timing differences arising during MAC processing. Vulnerable implementations do not properly consider timing side-channel attacks on a MAC check requirement during the processing of malformed CBC padding , which allows remote attackers to conduct distinguishing attacks and plaintext-recovery attacks via statistical analysis of timing data for crafted packets , aka the \"Lucky Thirteen\" issue. ， Details of this attack can be found at :  ， Recommendation :  ， RSA recommends that customers on RSA BSAFE SSL-J 5.1.x or lower upgrade to RSA BSAFE SSL-J 5.1.2. RSA recommends that customers on RSA BSAFE SSL-J 6.0 upgrade to RSA BSAFE SSL-J 6.0.1. ， To address BEAST , RSA introduce a new feature called first block splitting to RSA BSAFE SSL-J 6.0.1 and 5.1.2. First block splitting is designed to prevent the BEAST exploit by introducing unknown data into the encryption scheme prior to the attackers inserted plain text data. This is done as follows :  ， 1. The first plain text block to be encrypted is split into two blocks. The first block contains the first byte of the data , the second block contains the rest. ， 2. A MAC is generated from the one byte of data , the MAC key , and an increasing counter. This MAC is included in the first block. ， 3. The one byte of data , along with the MAC , is encrypted and becomes the IV for the next block. Because the IV is now essentially random data , it is impossible for an attacker to predict it and replace it with one of their own. ， For RSA BSAFE SSL-J 6.0.1 and 5.1.2 , first block splitting is engineered to be enabled by default for vulnerable cipher suites , making the application secure by default. If required , the application can disable first block splitting by setting the system property jsse.enableCBCProtection : ",
