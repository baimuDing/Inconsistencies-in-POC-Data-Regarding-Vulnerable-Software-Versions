For more information , see :  ， These products feature iPhone and Android applications that :  ， - Monitor onboard sensors , such as motion sensors and streaming audio ， - Actuate controls , such as relays and LEDs ， While researchers have reported some security issues relating to these products , their cloud features are secure when used on ， the local network. For more information , see :  ， IOActive examined the WeMo & # 8220 ; Light Switch& # 8221 ; firmware and uncovered a series of issues. When combined , these issues produce ， a variety of vulnerabilities :  ， - Remote control of attached devices over the internet ， - Malicious firmware updates ， - In some cases , remote monitoring ， - Internal LAN access ， The WeMo devices connect to the Internet using the STUN/TURN protocol. This gives users remote control of the devices and ， allows them to perform firmware updates from anywhere in the world. A generated GUID is the primary source of access control. ， WeMo also uses a GPG-based , encrypted firmware distribution scheme to maintain device integrity during updates. ， Unfortunately , attackers can easily bypass most of these features due to the way they are currently implemented in the WeMo ， product line. The command for performing firmware updates is initiated over the Internet from a paired device. Also , firmware ， update notices are delivered through an RSS-like mechanism to the paired device , rather than the WeMo device itself , which is ， distributed over a non-encrypted channel. As a result , attackers can easily push firmware updates to WeMo users by spoofing ， the RSS feed with a correctly signed firmware. ， The firmware updates are encrypted using GPG , which is intended to prevent this issue. Unfortunately , Belkin misuses the GPG ， asymmetric encryption functionality , forcing it to distribute the firmware-signing key within the WeMo firmware image. Most likely ,  ， Belkin intended to use the symmetric encryption with a signature and a shared public key ring. Attackers could leverage the ， current implementation to easily sign firmware images. ， Belkin uses STUN/TURN and an exposed firmware signing key. IOActive discovered an unfortunate configuration relating to this. ， A lack of entropy on the device results on less-than-random GUIDs. IOActive also discovered that the WeMo restful service ， endpoint is vulnerable to attack. We reported to Belkin an arbitrary file download flaw relating to this.",
