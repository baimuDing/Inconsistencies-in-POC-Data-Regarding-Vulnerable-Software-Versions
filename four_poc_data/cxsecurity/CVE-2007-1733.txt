Successful ， exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to execute ， arbitrary code in the context of the NaviCopa HTTP server. . ， The overflow can be triggered by sending a GET request in the following ways :  ， GET /cgi-bin/AAAAAAAAAAAAA. ， or ， GET /cgi/AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA. ， The amount of submitted characters depends on the location of the ， NaviCopa installation folder. By default ( Windows English version )  , it ， resides in the Program Files/NaviCOPA directory. In that case , eip is ， overwritten with characters 271 to 274. An exploit for this ， vulnerability has been developed and successfully tested against ， Windows 2000 Advanced Server , Windows XP SP2 and Windows Vista. Not ， surprisingly , ASLR ( Address Space Layout Randomization ) does not ， prevent reliable code execution due to its obvious limitations. ， An exploit for the Meatsploit Framework is available on our web site :  ， d=3&Itemid=37 ， Countermeasures :  ， The vendor was informed on March 23 , 2007 and published a patched ， version 2 hours later. Great response time !  ， Partner program :  ， If you are interested in learning more about vulnerability research ， and exploitation techniques , check out our advanced security training ， modules on www.skillTube.com.
