Summary ， QNX Software Systems Ltd.'s Neutrino RTOS ( QNX ) is a real-time ， operating system designed for use in embedded systems. From QNX's ， website :  ， \"Companies worldwide like Cisco , Delphi , Siemens , Alcatel and Texaco ， depend on ， the QNX technology for network routers , medical devices , intelligent ， transportation systems , safety and security systems , next-generation ， robotics , and other mission-critical applications. In addition , QNX ， forms the core for Ford Motor Co.'s Lincoln Aviator IAV , an ， engineering concept vehicle. The new system supports the development ， of next-generation in-car communications , infotainment , and ， telematics applications.\" More information is available at ， Local exploration of a buffer overflow vulnerability inside ， /usr/photon/bin/phgrafx included by default in QNX RTOS latest ， version ( 6.3.2 ) could allow an attacker to gain root privileges. ， II. Affected Products ， Scanit has confirmed the existence of this vulnerability in QNX RTOS ， 6.3.2 and ， QNX RTOS 6.3.0. Probably previous versions are vulnerable too. ， III.
