    "text": "vul_name : PHP 7.0.0 - Format String Vulnerability ， vul_cve : CVE-2015-8617 ， vul_poc : Overview ， A fun little format string vulnerability exists in PHP 7.0.0 due to how ， non-existent class names are handled. From my limited research I ， believe this issue is likely exploitable for full code execution ( see ， test script below ) . This issue does not appear to be present in ， previous PHP versions and has been patched in version 7.0.1. If you ， build a working exploit , drop me a line , I'd love to see ( andrew at ， jmpesp dot org ) . Shout out to the PHP team for fixing this so quickly",
