This means that there is a window of ， opportunity for an attacker to log into the database server during the ， install process. Depending upon \"which\" install options you choose ， determines the size of the window. Full details for those that are ， interested can be found here :  ， - since I reported ， this to Oracle on the 3rd of November they've updated their security ， checklist document :  ， ist_ ， db_database_20071108.pdf ， Cheers ,  ， David Litchfield ， E-MAIL DISCLAIMER ， The information contained in this email and any subsequent ， correspondence is private , is solely for the intended recipient ( s ) and ， may contain confidential or privileged information.
