Known symptoms of the problem include :  ， 1 ) 'svnadmin verify' is known to fail with errors beginning with :  ， \"svnadmin : E160013 : File not found : \" ， 2 ) 'svnsync' fails to replicate the revision. ， Apache Subversion clients have always rejected such filenames , so this ， issue cannot be triggered with stock Subversion clients. It could ,  ， however , be triggered by custom malicious Subversion clients or by ， third-party client implementations. ， Severity :  ， CVSSv2 Base Score : 4.9 ， CVSSv2 Base Vector : AV : N/AC : M/Au : S/C : N/I : P/A : P ， We consider this to be a medium risk vulnerability. Configurations which ， allow anonymous write access to the repository will be vulnerable to this ， without authentication. ， A remote authenticated attacker with commit access may be able to corrupt ， repositories on a Subversion server and cause disruption for other users. ， Recommendations :  ， We recommend all users to upgrade to Subversion 1.7.10 or 1.6.23. ， Users who are unable to upgrade may apply the included patches. ， New Subversion packages can be found at :  ， A workaround is to install the control-chars.py hook script as the ， pre-commit hook , which will prevent bad filenames from entering the ， repository. The script is available at this URL :  ， CVE-2013-1968 ( Subversion )  ， Reported by :  ， Stefan Sperling , elego Software Solutions GmbH ， Patches :  ， Patch for Subversion 1.7 :  ，  [  ， Index : subversion/libsvn_fs_fs/tree.c ， - subversion/libsvn_fs_fs/tree.c ( revision 1485181 )  ， + subversion/libsvn_fs_fs/tree.c ( revision 1485182 )  ， -44 , 6 +44 , 7",
