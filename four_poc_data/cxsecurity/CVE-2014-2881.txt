The random number generator ， used to produce secret values is the java.util.Random class , which is ， not of cryptographic quality. Publicly known predictors exist for the ， underlying RNG , and the seed is either 32-bit or 48-bit depending on the ， host system. ， Furthermore , the selection of the secret 'a' value within the key ， generation process is potentially vulnerable to timing attacks that leak ， the RNG state , as the implementation loops until the RNG outputs a value ， within a publicly known range. ， Further details at :  ， Copyright :  ， Copyright ( c ) Portcullis Computer Security Limited 2014 , All rights ， reserved worldwide.
