    "text": "vul_name : vBulletin 4.X and 5.X uploader.swf XSS ， vul_cve : CVE-2013-6780 ， vul_poc : The vBulletin team recently disclosed a XSS ( cross site scripting ) vulnerability in the uploader.swf file that is included by default on vBulletin 4 and 5. This file comes from the YUI library that is not supported anymore , so the vBulletin team is recommending everyone to remove that file asap from their installs. ， This is their full note :  ， It has come to our attention that there is a security issue in the uploader.swf file included as part of the Yahoo User Interface ( YUI ) library included in vBulletin 4. As the version of YUI included in vBulletin is end-of-lifed , Yahoo will not be fixing this issue. ， We recommend that you replace this with an empty file of the same name ( attached ) . What this will do is force vBulletin to use a fallback javascript based uploader which is already provided in your system. ， The vulnerable file is also present in the vBulletin 5 download package though not used by the vBulletin 5 front-end. We recommend that you delete the file and replace it with the attached file. ， To resolve this issue take the following steps :  ， -Delete uploader.swf located in clientscript/yui/uploader/assets or /core/clientscript/yui/uploader/assets ， -Replace it with the attached file. ， If you run vBulletin , please remove that file as soon as you can. Note that users of our CloudProxy website firewall are already protected against this threat. ， PoC : ",
