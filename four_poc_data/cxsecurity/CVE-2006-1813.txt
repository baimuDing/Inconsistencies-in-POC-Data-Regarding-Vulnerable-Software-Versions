The user login script is a javascript file called script.js. This file validates the user input in the logon box. But to my surprise this file is directly accessed by web browser . The disclosure of the source code can help an attacker to trigger code injections . ， Exploit :  ， Further a directory traversal is possible via malicious arguments passed on the web browser using POST Method relative to the path of phpWebftp ie. . ， 'server=1&port=21&goPassive=on&user=1&password=1&language=././././. ， /./././etc/passwd%00'",
