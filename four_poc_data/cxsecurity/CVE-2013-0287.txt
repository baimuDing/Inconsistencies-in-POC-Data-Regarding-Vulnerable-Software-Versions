    "text": "vul_name : sssd 1.9.0 privilege escalation ， vul_cve : CVE-2013-0287 ， vul_poc : This was posted to the linux-distros last week and as per the policy I'm ， posting it here now. ， Kaushik Banerjee discovered that SSSD's \"simple\" access provider did not ， work as expected when SSSD is configured as an Active Directory client ， when using the new ( as of version 1.9.0 ) Active Directory provider. ， During the PAM account phase , SSSD may not not know the group name of a ， group that the user is a member of , but only the Windows Security ， Identifier. Because the group name is not known , the simple_deny_groups ， option does not work at all , and will always permit access ; if any ， groups are noted in simple_deny_groups , all groups are permitted access. ， In addition , if any groups are noted in simple_allow_groups , access is ， always denied to everyone. ， By default , the configuration will allow all users to login ( both ， simple_deny_groups and simple_allow_groups are empty ) . ， The Active Directory provider was introduced in version 1.9.0 ; earlier ， versions of SSSD are not vulnerable to this flaw. ， Acknowledgements :  ， This issue was discovered by Kaushik Banerjee of Red Hat. ， Vincent Danen / Red Hat Security Response Team",
