    "text": "vul_name : SonicWall Pro DoS ， vul_cve : CVE-2003-1490 ， vul_poc :  ， Came across an apparent problem on a SonicWall Pro running firmware ， version 6.4.0.1 ROM version 5.0.1.0 during a vulnerability assessment and ， couldn't find any other postings on this problem so fwiw. the problem ， occurs when sending a large HTTP POST to the inside interface - may affect ， others just didn't test as the outside interface was blocked. I was able ， to confirm this problem using two separate Nessus plugins ( 10012 and ， 10687 ) . The behavior of the firewall suggests a buffer overflow but since ， I'm not familiar with the internals of this system it's just a guess. 15- ， 20 seconds after sending the POST to the firewall the firewall goes ， through a reset cycle. This delay suggests to me a section of code that is ， being overwritten. At the very least , this is a Denial of Service problem. ， Vendor was notified of the problem.",
