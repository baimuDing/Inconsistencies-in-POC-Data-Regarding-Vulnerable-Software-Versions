    "text": "vul_name : Linux Kernel 3.2 VFAT slab-based buffer overflow ， vul_cve : CVE-2013-1773 ， vul_poc : I'd like to request a CVE for an issue leading to a buffer overflow of ， a slab allocated buffer in the VFAT file system code. The issue ， manifests when converting UTF8 characters to UTF16 inside the ， \"utf8s_to_utf16s\" function. Reaching this code requires writing to a ， VFAT partition that has been mounted with the \"utf8\" option. Ubuntu ， 10.04 mounts USB sticks with this option by default. Most Android ， devices mount eMMC/SD cards/etc with this option. ， The issue affects kernels prior to 3.2. Many Android devices remain ， affected today. ， I'm not entirely sure when the issue was introduced at this moment. It ， appears to have been introduced here :  ， The issue was fixed here :  ， The issue was partially disclosed here ( this spurred my investigation )  :  ， Props to G13 for finding it. It's pretty disappointing that ， Google/Android security teams ( and of course Linux maintainers ) didn't ， responsibly disclose the issue so other Linux kernel packagers could ， package a fix. ， If anyone wishes to contact me off-list with questions or concerns ,  ， feel free. ， Thanks ,  ， Joshua J. Drake ， jduck",
