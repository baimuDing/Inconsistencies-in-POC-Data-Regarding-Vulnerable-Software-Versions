    "text": "vul_name : Linux Kernel 3.11-rc ARM/perf priviledge escalation ， vul_cve : CVE-2013-4254 ， vul_poc : I'm not really a security researcher , so hopefully I'm reporting this in ， the proper way. ， I have a fuzzer tool for the perf_event_open (  ) syscall that found ， a few oopses on the ARM platform , which I reported to lkml a week ago. ， One of the oopses can lead to a local privilege escalation on ARM-perf. ， This fix can be found here :  ， The discussion thread is :  ， The hope is this appears in 3.11-rc6 but my attempts to get the people at ， security (  ) vger kernel org to take this seriously didn't really go very ， well. ， I do have code that will exploit the kernel and give me a root shell ， on an ARM Pandaboard machine running 3.11-rc4. The exploit is a bit ， fragile though :  ， + Only works on ARM ， + Elevates from normal user to root , no special config required. ， perf_event syscalls run as regular users , not sure why some ， think you need root. ， + It does need a user-mappable address at an exact byte offset ， from a pmu_struct in memory. This limits things somewhat ; in ， my testing 3.11-rc kernels have INT_MIN at exactly the right place ， but the exploit doesn't work on a 3.7.6 kernel ,  ， it just oopses or crashes the machine. ， diff -git a/arch/arm/kernel/perf_event.c b/arch/arm/kernel/perf_event.c ， index d9f5cd4.0500f10b 100644 ， - a/arch/arm/kernel/perf_event.c ， + b/arch/arm/kernel/perf_event.c ， -253 , 6 +253 , 9 validate_event ( struct pmu_hw_events * hw_events ,  ， struct arm_pmu * armpmu = to_arm_pmu ( event->pmu )  ;  ， struct pmu * leader_pmu = event->group_leader->pmu ;  ， + if ( is_software_event ( event )  ， + return 1 ;  ， +",
