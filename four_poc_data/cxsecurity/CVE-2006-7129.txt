Its critical files like its ， database of trusted applications or firewall configuration are protected. The list of protected files is stored in ， filelock.txt in the BlackICE installation directory. If this file is deleted files mentioned in filelock.txt are not ， protected any more and can be changed by malicious applications. The implemented protection allows malicious ， applications to delete this file using native API function ZwDeleteFile. This can result in a bypass of all BlackICE ， protection mechanisms because its internal componenets can be replaced with fake copies. The situation is even easier ， Vulnerable software :  ，  * BlackICE PC Protection 3.6.cpu ，  * BlackICE PC Protection 3.6.cpj ，  * probably all versions of BlackICE PC Protection 3.6 ，  * possibly older versions of BlackICE PC Protection ， More details and a proof of concept including source code is available here :  ， ass.php ， Regards ,  ， Matousec - Transparent security Research",
