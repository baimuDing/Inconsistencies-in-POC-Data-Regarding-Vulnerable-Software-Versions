    "text": "vul_name : OpenX 2.8.1 remote code execution ， vul_cve : CVE-2009-4098 ， vul_poc : -BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE- ， Hash : SHA512 ， Hi ,  ， OpenX adserver version 2.8.1 and lower is vulnerable to remote code ， execution. To be exploited , this vulnerability requires banner / file ， upload permissions , such as granted to the 'advertiser' and ， 'administrator' roles. ， This vulnerability is caused by the ( insecure ) file upload mechanism of ， affected OpenX versions. These would check magic bytes of an uploaded ， file to determine its MIME type , and erroneously assume this ， information to be reliable. Additionally , while the file name of ， uploaded files is changed , the file extension is not. ， As such , it is possible to upload image files with embedded PHP code and ， .php file extension. Unless PHP script execution is explicitly prevented ， manual so far and it is not the result of a default installation )  , the ， PHP code will execute as soon as HTTP access to the file location will ， cause it to be executed by the web server. ， To clarify , an attacker exploiting this security issue does require ， prior access to OpenX , i.e. exploitation is only possible after ， successful authentication. On the other hand , advertiser access is a ， rather low permission level and should not allow for system access. ， If these bugs were not hidden from OpenX' bug tracker , you could read up ， more about issue X-5747 here :  ， OpenX 2.8.2 has already been released in October to fix this issue and ， can be downloaded from ， Moritz Naumann ， Naumann IT Security Consulting ， Berlin , Germany",
