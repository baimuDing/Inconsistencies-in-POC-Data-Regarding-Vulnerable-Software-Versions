BACKGROUND ， Trend Micro Inc.'s ServerProtect provides antivirus scanning with ， centralized management of virus outbreaks , scanning , patter file ， updates , notifications and remote installations. More information about ， the product set is available at :  ， www.trendmicro.com/en/products/file-server/sp/evaluate/overview.htm ， II. DESCRIPTION ， Remote exploitation of a denial of service vulnerability in Trend Micro ， Inc.'s ServerProtect EarthAgent daemon allow attackers to cause the ， target process to consume 100% of available CPU resources. ， The problem specifically exists within ServerProtect EarthAgent in the ， handling of maliciously crafted packets transmitted with the magic value ， \"x21x43x65x87\" targeting TCP port 5005. A memory leak also occurs ， with each received exploit packet allowing an attacker to exhaust all ， available memory resources with repeated attack. ， III. ANALYSIS ， Successful exploitation of the described vulnerability allows ， unauthenticated remote attackers to consume 100% CPU resources ,  ， increasingly consume memory resources and potentially crash the ， underlying operating system. Full CPU utilization can be achieved with a ， single packet , memory consumption occurs incrementally on subsequent ， attacks. ， IV. DETECTION ， iDefense has confirmed the existence of this vulnerability in Trend ， Micro ServerProtect for Windows Management Console 5.58 running with ， Trend Micro Control Manager 2.5/3.0 and Trend Micro Damage Cleanup ， Server 1.1. It is suspected that earlier versions and versions for other ， platforms are vulnerable as well. ， V. WORKAROUND ， Employ firewalls , access control lists or other TCP/UDP restriction ， mechanisms to limit access to vulnerable systems on TCP port 5005. ， VI. VENDOR RESPONSE ， The vendor has released the following security advisory for this issue :  ， solutionDetail.asp?solutionID=25254 ， \"Contact Trend Micro Technical Support to request for the ， SPNT5.58_HotfixB1137.zip file , which should only be installed on servers ， running SPNT 5.58.\" ， VII. CVE INFORMATION ， The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures ( CVE ) project has assigned the ， name CVE-2005-1928 to this issue. This is a candidate for inclusion in ， the CVE list ( which standardizes names for ， security problems.",
