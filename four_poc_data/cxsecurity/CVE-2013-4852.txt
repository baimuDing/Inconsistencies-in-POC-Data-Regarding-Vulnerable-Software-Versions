    "text": "vul_name : PuTTY 0.62 Heap Overflow ， vul_cve : CVE-2013-4852 ， vul_poc : PuTTY SSH handshake heap overflow ( CVE-2013-4852 )  ， Description :  ， PuTTY versions 0.62 and earlier - as well as all software that ， integrates these versions of PuTTY - are vulnerable to an integer overflow ， leading to heap overflow during the SSH handshake before authentication ,  ， caused ， by improper bounds checking of the length parameter received from the ， SSH server. ， This allows remote attackers to cause denial of service , and may have more ， severe impact on the operation of software that uses PuTTY code. ， Affected software products :  ， - PuTTY up to and including 0.62 ， - WinSCP before 5.1.6 ， - all other software that uses vulnerable ( revision 9895 or earlier )  ， PuTTY code ， Details :  ， A malformed size value in the SSH handshake could cause an integer ， overflow , as ， the getstring (  ) function in sshrsa.c and sshdss.c read the handshake ， message ， length without checking that it was not a negative number. ， Specifically , the bignum_from_bytes (  ) function invoked by getstring (  )  ， received a ， data buffer along with its length represented by a signed integer ，  ( nbytes ) and ， performed the following arithmetical operation before allocating memory ， to store ， the buffer :  ， w = ( nbytes + BIGNUM_INT_BYTES - 1 ) / BIGNUM_INT_BYTES ; / *  ， bytes->words * / ， result = newbn ( w )  ;  ， If the value of nbytes was -1 ( 0xffffffff )  , the value of w would ， overflow to a ， very small positive number ( depending on the value of BIGNUM_INT_BYTES )  ,  ， causing ， newbn (  ) to reserve a very small memory area. Then a large number of ， bytes would ， be copied into the data buffer afterwards , resulting in a heap overflow. ， Similarly , if nbytes was chosen so that w would be -1 , the newbn (  ) function ， would allocate zero bytes in memory via snewn (  ) and attempt to write the ， size of ， the Bignum ( in four bytes ) into the allocated zero-byte area , also ， resulting in ， a heap overflow. ， Consequences :  ， In the standalone PuTTY client the attacker does not have precise ， control over ， the memory corruption , so this bug can only cause a local denial-of-service ，  ( crash ) . However , in other software that uses PuTTY code , such heap ， corruption ， could have more severe effects. Specifically in case of WinSCP , this ， vulnerability could potentially lead to code execution due to the exception ， handling employed by the program.",
