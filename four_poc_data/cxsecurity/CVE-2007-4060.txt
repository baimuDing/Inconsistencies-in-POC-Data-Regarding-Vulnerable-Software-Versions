The vulnerability can lead to denial of service ， attacks against the web server and potentially to the remote execution ， of arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the server. ， Details ， CoreHTTP ( is a minimalist web server ， focusing on speed and size. More information about its features can be found ， at ， CoreHTTP (up to and including version 0.5.3.1) employs an insufficient ， input validation method for handling HTTP requests with invalid method ， names and URIs. Specifically, the vulnerability is an off-by-one buffer ， overflow in the sscanf() call at file src/http.c line numbers 45 and 46: ， 45: sscanf(parentsprock->buffer, ， 46: \"%\" PATHSIZE_S \"[A-Za-z] %\" PATHSIZE_S \"s%*[ \\t\\n]\", req, url); ， The buffers req and url are declared to be of size 256 bytes (PATHSIZE) ， and the sscanf() call writes 256 bytes (PATHSIZE_S) to these buffers ， without NULL terminating them. ， Note that this is not vulnerability CVE-2007-4060 in which the same ， sscanf() call contained no bounds check at all. ， This vulnerability can lead to denial of service attacks against the ， CoreHTTP web server and potentially to the remote execution of ， arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the server. We ， have developed a proof-of-concept exploit to demonstrate the ， vulnerability: ， For the time being, one may use the following workaround to address this ， issue, until an official fix is released by the author: ， Patroklos Argyroudis"
