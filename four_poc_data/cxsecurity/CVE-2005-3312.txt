INTRODUCTION ， Microsoft Internet Explorer is since many years the most popular web ， browser. The main reason for this popularity is the default use in the ， latest releases of the Microsoft Windows operating system series. ， More Information are available at the official Microsoft Internet ， Explorer web site :  ， II. DESCRIPTION ， Sven Vetsch found a cross site scripting vulnerability in the current ， releases of Microsoft Internet Explorer. Thus , it is possible to use a ， manipulated embedded content to run arbitrary script code in the ， security context of the website. ， The problem lies in the handling of the content of such files ( e.g. a ， picture ) . In the first place the usual file header ( e.g. for GIF files )  ， is provided - The remaining content of the file could be usual html ， data. Therefore embedding script code in the latter may be possible. ， This injected code is executed by the HTML rendering engine of the web ， browser. In the proof-of-concept by Sven Vetsch and the examples of scip ， AG a GIF file is used ( see chapter III ) . But it seems other files that ， could be embedded in an html file could be used too ( e.g. JPG , WAV , AVI ,  ， RM/RAM ) . ， It seems that the Internet Explorer is putting all the data ( HTML frame ， and embedded content ) into one stream. Afterwards this one is put thru ， the rendering engine. This is not able to determine the real beginning ， and end of an embedded file. Content of those - not expected in any way ， - is handled as HTML code too. ， More details are available at the scip vulnerability Database at ，  ( german only ) . ， III. EXPLOITATION ， The following proof-of-concept has been published in the articles \"Wie ， mit GIF-Bildern Cross Site Scripting-Angriffe im Internet Explorer ， umgesetzt werden knnen\" in scip monthly Security Summary Issue 19. ， September 2005 ( pp. 12-14 )  [ 1 ] and \"GIF-Bug im Internet Explorer 6 - ， Proof of Concept\" at computec.ch [ 2 ]  :  ， 01 <GIF89a? 8 ?f?>",
