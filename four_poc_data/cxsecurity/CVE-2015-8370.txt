    "text": "vul_name : Grub2 Authentication Bypass 0-Day ， vul_cve : CVE-2015-8370 ， vul_poc : A vulnerability in Grub2 has been found. Versions from 1.98 ( December , 2009 ) to 2.02 ( December , 2015 ) are affected. The vulnerability can be exploited under certain circumstances , allowing local attackers to bypass any kind of authentication ( plain or hashed passwords ) . And so , the attacker may take control of the computer. ， Grub2 is the bootloader used by most Linux systems including some embedded systems. This results in an incalculable number of affected devices. ， Am I vulnerable ? ， To quickly check if your system is vulnerable , when the Grub ask you the username , press the keyspace 28 times. If your machine reboots or you get a rescue shell then your Grub is affected. ， Impact ， An attacker which successfully exploits this vulnerability will obtain a Grub rescue shell. Grub rescue is a very powerful shell allowing to :  ， Elevation of privilege : The attacker is authenticated without knowing a valid username nor the password. The attacker has full access to the grub's console ( grub rescue ) . ， Information disclosure : The attacker can load a customized kernel and initramfs ( for example from a USB ) and then from a more comfortable environment , copy the full disk or install a rootkit. ， Denial of service : The attacker is able to destroy any data including the grub itself. Even in the case that the disk is ciphered the attacker can overwrite it , causing a DoS. ， The Vulnerability ， The fault ( bug ) is in the code of Grub since version 1.98 ( December , 2009 ) . The commit which introduced the fault was b391bdb2f2c5ccf29da66cecdbfb7566656a704d , affecting the grub_password_get (  ) function. ， There are two functions which suffer the same integer underflow fault. The grub_username_get (  ) and grub_password_get (  ) located in grub-core/normal/auth.c and lib/crypto.c respectively. Both functions are equal except for a call to printf (  ) in the get_username_get (  ) . The PoC described here is based only on exploiting the grub_username_get (  ) to obtain a Grub rescue shell.",
