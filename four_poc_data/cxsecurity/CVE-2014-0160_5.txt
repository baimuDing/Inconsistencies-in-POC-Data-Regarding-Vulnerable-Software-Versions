A vulnerability has been discovered in ， OpenSSL library which may allow an unauthenticated , remote attacker to ， retrieve memory in chunks of 64 kilobytes from a connected client or ， server. An exploit could disclose portions of memory containing ， sensitive security material such as passwords and private keys. ， AFFECTED SOFTWARE VERSIONS AND DEVICES ， Device Affected software ， Smart Cell Gateway 1.1.x ， SmartCell Access Points NOT AFFECTED ， ZoneDirector Controllers NOT AFFECTED ， ZoneFlex Access Points NOT AFFECTED ， Any products or services not mentioned in the table above are not affected ， DETAILS ， A vulnerability has been discovered in the popular OpenSSL ， cryptographic software library. This weakness exists in OpenSSL's ， implementation of the TLS/DTLS ( transport layer security protocols )  ， heartbeat extension ( RFC6520 ) . This vulnerability is due to a missing ， bounds check in implementation of the handling of the heartbeat ， extension. When exploited , this issue may lead to leak of memory ， contents from the server to the client and from the client to the ， server. These memory contents could contain sensitive security ， material such as passwords and private keys. ， IMPACT ， Ruckus devices incorporate OpenSSL library to implement various ， security related features. Below is list of the affected components :  ， - - Administrative HTTPS Interface ( Port 8443 )  ， CVSS v2 Base Score : 5.0 ( MEDIUM )  ( AV : N/AC : L/Au : N/C : P/I : N/A : N )  ， WORKAROUNDS ， Ruckus recommends that all customers apply the appropriate patch ( es )  ， as soon as practical.
