Cross Site Scripting # 1 ， Horde is subject to a client side script injection vulnerability in ， the URL redirection ( dereferrer ) function. ， By accessing the following ( partial ) URI on a web site running an ， affected version with a web browser which is prone to this issue ,  ， client side script code will be injected into the output generated ， by the application :  ，  [ Base_URI ] /services/go.php?url= ， This problem is caused by insufficient validation of user supplied ， input. It is only known to be exploitable on Internet Explorer 6 ，  ( tested on v6.2900.2180 including all patches on Windows XP SP2 ) . ， Internet Explorer 7 beta 3 is not affected. ， + 2. Cross Site Scripting # 2 ， Horde is subject to a client side script injection vulnerability in ， the help function. ， By accessing the following ( partial ) URI on a web site running a ， vulnerable version with a web browser which is prone to this issue ,  ， client side script code will be injected into the output generated ， by the application :  ，  [ Base_URI ] /services/help/?show=about&module=%3Cmeta%20http-equiv=%22refr ， esh%22%20content=%220 ; URL=javascript : alert ( 0 ) %3B%22%3E ， This problem is caused by insufficient validation of user supplied ， input. All common modern browsers providing Javascript support are ， assumed to be prone to this issue. ， + 3. Cross Site Scripting # 3 ， Horde is subject to a client side script injection ， vulnerability in the problem reporting function. ， By accessing the following ( partial ) URI on a web site running a ， vulnerable version with a web browser which is prone to this issue ,  ， client side script code will be injected into the output generated ， by the application :  ，  [ Base_URI ] /services/problem.php?name=%22%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert ( 0 ) %3B%3C/sc ， ript%20x=%22 ， This problem is caused by insufficient validation of user supplied ， input. All common modern browsers providing Javascript support are ， assumed to be prone to this issue. ， + 4. Cross Site Scripting # 4 , Web tunneling behaviour ， Horde is subject to a server side issue which allows to tunnel HTTP ， GET requests through the application and to inject remotely hosted ， web script into the output generated by the application. ， This behaviour allows for accessing arbitrary locations which are ， addressable using URIs starting with ' or ， 'ftp : /' protocol handlers. These locations will be accessible from ， within the security context of the web server running an affected ， version of the application. As a result , an attacker may be able to ， access remote locations s/he would not have otherwise access to ,  ， without disclosing the real source of the request [ 1 ] . Additionally ,  ， insufficiently access restricted local ( server-side ) or remote ( 3rd ， party ) locations may become available [ 2 ] . ， By tricking a victim into starting a tunnelling call to a previously ， prepared malicious HTML file , stored in a remote location , which ， contains web script which may be executed on the client side , it is ， possible to extend this into a script injection issue. The injected ， script would be executed by the client within the context of the ， domain the vulnerable web application is hosted in. [ 3 ] All common ， modern browsers providing Javascript support are assumed to be prone ， to this issue. ， By accessing the following ( partial ) URIs on a web site running a ， vulnerable version with a web browser , the behaviours described ， above may be triggered :  ，  [ 1 ]  ，  [ Base_URI ] /horde/services/go.php?untrusted=1&url= ， om/ ，  [ 2 ]  ，  [ Base_URI ] /horde/services/go.php?untrusted=1&url= ， -status ，  [ 3 ]  ，  [ Base_URI ] /horde/services/go.php?untrusted=1&url= ， om/logger/xss.html ， BACKGROUND ， Cross Site Scripting ( XSS )  :  ， Cross Site Scripting , also known as XSS or CSS , describes ， the injection of malicious content into output produced ， by a web application. A common attack vector is the ， inclusion of arbitrary client side script code into the ， applications' output. Failure to completely sanitize user ， input from malicious content can cause a web application ， to be vulnerable to Cross Site Scripting. ， WORKAROUNDS ， Issues 1-3 :  ， Client : Disable Javascript. ， Server : Prevent access to vulnerable file ( s ) . ， Issues 1-3 :  ， Client : Use application as intended only. ， Server : Prevent access to vulnerable file ( s ) . ， SOLUTIONS ， The Horde project has released versions 3.1.2 and 3.1.11 today. ， These are supposed to fix all of the above issues.
