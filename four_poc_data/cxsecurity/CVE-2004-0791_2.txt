Problem Description ， The Internet Control Message Protocol is used to alert ， hosts on a network about certain situations , and the hosts ， then take automatic action to prevent network failures or ， to improve transport efficiency. The RFC recommends no ， security checking for in-bound ICMP messages , so long as ， a related connection exists , and may potentially allow ， several different Denials of Service. The following ， individual attacks are reported : A blind connection-reset ， attack is reported , which takes advantage of the specification ， that describes that on receiving a 'hard' ICMP error , the ， corresponding connection should be aborted. A remote ， attacker may terminate target TCP connections and deny ， service for legitimate users. ， The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project ( cve.mitre.org )  ， has assigned the name CAN-2004-0790 to this issue. ， An ICMP Source Quench ， attack is reported , which exploits the specification that ， a host must react to ICMP Source Quench messages by slowing ， transmission on the associated connection. A remote attacker ， may effectively degrade performance for a legitimate ， connection. ， The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project ( cve.mitre.org )  ， has assigned the name CAN-2004-0791 to this issue. ， A suitable forged ICMP PMTUD message may be used to reduce the ， MTU for a given connection in a similar manner. ， The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project ( cve.mitre.org )  ， has assigned the name CAN-2004-1060 to this issue. ， 2. Vulnerable Supported Versions ， System Binaries ， OpenServer 6.0.0 inet driver ， 3. Solution ， The proper solution is to install the latest packages. ， 4. OpenServer 6.0.0 ， 4.1 Location of Fixed Binaries ， ftp : /ftp.sco.com/pub/updates/OpenServer/SCOSA-2005.38 ， 4.2 Verification ， MD5 ( VOL.000.000 ) = 8b97daeeba0c5653d1e01d589109c250 ， md5 is available for download from ， ftp : /ftp.sco.com/pub/security/tools ， 4.3 Installing Fixed Binaries ， Upgrade the affected binaries with the following sequence :  ， 1 ) Download the VOL * files to a directory ， 2 ) Run the custom command , specify an install from media ， images , and specify the directory as the location of the ， images. ， 5. ， Specific references for this advisory :  ， SCO security resources :  ， SCO security advisories via email ， This security fix closes SCO incidents sr894918 fz530661 ， erg712928. ， 6.
