    "text": "vul_name : MapServer 5.6.4 and 4.10.6 released with important security fixes ， vul_cve : CVE-2010-2539 , CVE-2010-2540 ， vul_poc : The MapServer team announces the release of MapServer version 5.6.4 and ， 4.10.6. ， No new functionality has been added. 5.6.4 is a maintenance release that ， fixes a few issues ( including a potential security vulnerability ) that ， were found since the release of 5.6.3. The list of fixes since 5.6.3 is ， included at the end of this message. ， With respect to the 4.10.6 release , it only includes the security fixes ， described below. ， SECURITY FIXES :  ， As part of a security audit of MapServer 5.6 it was reported that some ， of the mapserv CGI command-line arguments used by developers for ， debugging and testing the software constitute a security risk that could ， potentially be exploited remotely. We are not aware of any exploit for ， this issue at the moment , but it is strongly advised that users of past ， releases upgrade to the latest releases that disable the potentially ， insecure command-line args. ， We will not disclose any of the details here , but potential ， vulnerabilities were demonstrated to our team and it was recommended ， that we take actions to avoid command-line arguments in CGI programs. As ， a result and to create the smallest possible amount of disruption in ， point releases , for this release we simply disabled all mapserv ， command-line debug args by default , except for \"-v\" which is useful to ， get mapserv version on an installed system , as well as \"-nh\" and ， \"QUERY_STRING=.\" which add no risk and/or are used by msautotests and ， in some docs. ， This change does not affect functionality for regular mapserv CGI users ， working through HTTP , it only impacts developers that use those ， command-line arguments to debug and test the software. It should be ， noted that the use of command-line args for testing and debugging the ， software may be deprecated and replaced by a different mechanism in ， future releases. ， This release also fixes at least one important buffer overflow. ， Even if we release only 5.6.4 and 4.10.6 today , these security fixes ， have also been backported to all stable branches ( going back to 4.10 ) in ， MapServer's Subversion ( SVN ) source code repository , so if you work from ， source and would like to patch your local MapServer source tree , the ， changeset ( i.e. patch file ) for each stable release can be obtained ， through the Trac ticket for each issue :  ， Source and binary downloads :  ， The source code is available at :  ， The binary distributions listed in the download page should be updated ， with binaries for the new 5.6.4 release in the next few hours. ， We are also in the process of submitting security patches to the Ubuntu ， and Debian supported distributions. ， Version 5.6.4 ( 2010-07-08 )  :  ， IMPORTANT SECURITY FIXES :  ， - Disabled some insecure ( and potentially exploitable ) mapserv command-line ， debug arguments (  # 3485 ) . The -enable-cgi-cl-debug-args configure switch ， can be used to re-enable them for devs who really cannot get away without ， them and who understand the potential security risk ( not recommended for ， production servers or those who don't understand the security ， implications ) . ， - Fixed possible buffer overflow in msTmpFile (  )  (  # 3484 )  ， Other fixes :  ， - Fixed possible race condition with connectiontype WFS layers (  # 3137 )  ， - Modified mapserver units enum order to fix some problems with external ， packages (  # 3173 )  ， - fix blending of transparent layers with AGG on MSB archs (  # 3471 )  ， - Fixed imageObj->saveImage (  ) sends unnecessary headers (  # 3418 )  ， - Correct PropertyName parsing for wfs post requests (  # 3235 )  ， - Ensure mapwmslayer.c does not unlink file before closing connection on ， it (  # 3451 )  ， - Fix security exception issue in C # with MSVC2010 (  # 3438 )  ， - Write out join CONNECTIONTYPE when saving a mapfile. (  # 3435 )  ， - Fixed attribute queries to use an extent stored ( and cached ) as part of ， the queryObj rather than the map->extent. (  # 3424 )  ， - Reverted msLayerWhichItems (  ) to 5.4-like behavior although still ， supporting ， retrieving all items (  # 3356 ,  # 3342 )  ， - Grid layer : remove drawing of unnecessary gird lines (  # 3433 )  ， - OGC Filters for spatial dbs should be enclosed in parentheses (  # 3430 )  ， - Improve the handling of simple string comparisons for raster classified ， values (  # 3425 )  ， - Add the ogc namspace to filters generated by Mapserver (  # 3414 )  ， - Fix MS_NONSQUARE to work in mode=map (  # 3413 )  ， - Improve error message when loadQuery (  ) filename extension check fails ，  (  # 3302 )  ， - Fix GetLegendGraphic using keyimages (  # 3398 )  ， - Fix getFeatureInfo queries on WFS layers (  # 3403 )  ， - Fixed mapstring.c build problem related to errno (  # 3401 ) . ， - Correct ungeoreferenced defaults via GetExtent (  ) on raster layer (  # 3368 )  ， - More adjustments to how TLOCK_GDAL held around msGetGDALGeoTransform ，  (  # 3368 ) ",
