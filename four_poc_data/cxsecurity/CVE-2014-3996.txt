It automates your ， regular desktop management routines like installing patches ,  ， distributing software , managing your IT Assets , managing software ， licenses , monitoring software usage statistics , managing USB device ， usage , taking control of remote desktops , and more.\" ， \"Password Manager Pro is a secure vault for storing and managing ， shared sensitive information such as passwords , documents and digital ， identities of enterprises.\" ， \"Managing mission critical business applications is now made easy ， through ManageEngine IT360. With agentless monitoring methodology ,  ， monitor your applications , servers and databases with ease. Agentless ， monitoring of your business applications enables you high ROI and low ， TOC. With integrated network monitoring and bandwidth utilization ,  ， quickly troubleshoot any performance related issue with your network ， and assign issues automatically with ITIL based ServiceDesk ， integration.\" ， These products have managed service providers ( MSP ) versions which are ， used to control the desktops and smartphones of several clients. ， Quoting the author of the Internet Census 2012 : \"As a rule of thumb ,  ， nobody\" , there are at least 1000 people who did.\" ， These vulnerabilities can be abused to achieve remote code execution ， as SYSTEM in Windows or as the user in Linux. Needless to say , owning ， a Desktop Central / IT360 box will give you control of all the ， computers and smartphones it manages , while owning Password Manager ， Pro will give you a treasure trove of passwords. ， Technical details :  ， The two blind SQL injections described below have been present in ， Desktop Central , Password Manager Pro and IT360 in all releases since ， 2006. They can only be triggered via a GET request , which means you ， can only inject around 8000 characters at a time. ，  # 1 ， Vulnerability :  ， Blind SQL injection in LinkViewFetchServlet ( unauthenticated on DC/PMP ， / authenticated on IT360 )  ， CVE-2014-3996 ， Affected products / versions :  ， - ManageEngine Desktop Central ( DC )  [ MSP ]  : all versions from v4 up to ， v9 build 90033 ， - ManageEngine Password Manager Pro ( PMP )  [ MSP ]  : all versions from v5 ， to version 7 build 7002 ， - ManageEngine IT360 [ MSP ]  : all versions from v8 to v10.1.1 build 10110 ， This affects all versions of the products released since 19-Apr-2006. ， Other ManageEngine products might be affected. ， Constraints :  ， - DC : no authentication or any other information needed ， - PMP : no authentication or any other information needed ， - IT360 : valid user account needed ，  ， 'Description' => %q{ ， This module exploits an unauthenticated blind SQL injection in LinkViewFetchServlet ,  ， which is exposed in ManageEngine Desktop Central v7 build 70200 to v9 build 90033 and ， Password Manager Pro v6 build 6500 to v7 build 7002 ( including the MSP versions ) . The ， SQL injection can be used to achieve remote code execution as SYSTEM in Windows or as ， the user in Linux. This module exploits both PostgreSQL ( newer builds ) and MySQL ( older ， or upgraded builds ) . MySQL targets are more reliable due to the use of relative paths ;  ， with PostgreSQL you should find the web root path via other means and specify it with ， WEB_ROOT. ， The injection is only exploitable via a GET request , which means that the payload ， has to be sent in chunks smaller than 8000 characters ( URL size limitation ) . Small ， payloads and the use of exe-small is recommended , as you can only do between 10 and ， 20 injections before using up all the available ManagedConnections until the next ， server restart. ， This vulnerability exists in all versions released since 2006 , however builds below ， DC v7 70200 and PMP v6 6500 do not ship with a JSP compiler. You can still try your ， luck using the MySQL targets as a JDK might be installed in the $ PATH. ， }",
