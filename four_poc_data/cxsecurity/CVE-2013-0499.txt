Falkenberg ， SEC Consult Vulnerability Lab ， Vendor/product description :  ， WebSphere DataPower appliances simplify , govern , and optimize the delivery ， of services and applications and enhance the security of XML and IT services. ， They extend the capabilities of an infrastructure by providing a multitude of ， functions. ， URL :  ， Vulnerability overview/description :  ， For the purposes of debugging , DataPower provides configuration options to ， echo requests received from the client. For example , XML Firewall service can ， be configured to echo requests by choosing the backend as 'loopback'. Other ， services like Multi Protocol Gateway and Web Service Proxy can be configured ， to echo requests by setting the variable & # 8220 ; var : /service/mpgw/skip-backside& # 8221 ; in ， its processing policy. ， In such configurations , the requests are not sent to a backend server. Without ， adequate validation and processing , the requests may be echoed back to the ， client. Loopback services that blindly echo requests should only be used for ， debugging purposes and not intended to be run in production environments as ， they can result in potential security threats. For example , if an arbitrary ， JavaScript embedded request is sent to such services , they will simply echo it ， back resulting in a potential JavaScript execution vulnerability in the ， client's browser. ， URL : ",
