If tmail is used for mail delivery from a ， process whose UID is not the destination user , it must be installed setuid ， root ; dmail can be used when the process is run as the destination user. ， Problem ， A vulnerability exists in both applications due to missing boundary checks on ， the folder extension argument from the command line. The bug can be exploited ， by overflowing a stack buffer via an overly long folder name. ， For tmail , this could allow for arbitrary code execution as the root user. As ， mentioned the vulnerability also exists for dmail , but the impact is a bit ， less critical since it usually runs as the recipient user and not root. ， Depending on the mailer daemon and configuration in use , this bug may also ， be remotely exploitable.",
