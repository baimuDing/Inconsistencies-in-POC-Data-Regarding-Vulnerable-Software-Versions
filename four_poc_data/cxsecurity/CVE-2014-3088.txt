The first step in many attacks is to get some code to the system to be attacked. Then the attack only needs to find a way to get the code executed. Using a file upload helps the attacker accomplish the first step. The consequences of unrestricted file upload can vary , including complete system takeover , an overloaded file system or database , forwarding attacks to back-end systems , and simple defacement. It depends on what the application does with the uploaded file and especially where it is stored. ， There are really two classes of problems here. The first is with the file metadata , like the path and file name. These are generally provided by the transport , such as HTTP multi-part encoding. This data may trick the application into overwriting a critical file or storing the file in a bad location. You must validate the metadata extremely carefully before using it. ， The other class of problem is with the file size or content. The range of problems here depends entirely on what the file is used for. See the examples below for some ideas about how files might be misused. To protect against this type of attack , you should analyze everything your application does with files and think carefully about what processing and interpreters are involved. ，  [ 0x01 ] Exploit Description ， IBM Sametime Meeting Server allow anonymous users to send arbitrary files by modifying the Content-Type header and file extension , as demonstrated by replacing a text/plain .txt upload with an application/octet-stream .exe upload. in the post request. The file upload restrictions occurs only client side. ，  [ 0x02 ] PoC - Proof of Concept ， For exploit this vulnerability , you can use Burp Suite or another proxy of your choice. ， Original content ， POST /stconf.nsf/wAttach?OpenForm&Seq=1&5F1BF7DE56F68DA583257D040071276C0 HTTP/1.1 ， Host : sametime02.myserver.com.br ， User-Agent : Mozilla/5.0 ( Windows NT 6.1 ; rv : 29.0 ) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/29.0",
