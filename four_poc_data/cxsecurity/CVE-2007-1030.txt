    "text": "vul_name : Remote DoS in libevent DNS parsing <= 1.2a ， vul_cve : CVE-2007-1030 ， vul_poc : Author : Jon Oberheide <jon ( at ) oberheide ( dot ) org [ email concealed ] > ， Date : Sun , February 18th , 2007 ， Summary ， Application : libevent ， Affected Versions : 1.2 - 1.2a ， Vendor Website :  ， Type of Vulnerability : Denial of Service - Remote ， Background ， The libevent API provides a mechanism to execute a callback function ， when a specific event occurs on a file descriptor or after a timeout ， has been reached. Furthermore , libevent also support callbacks due ， to signals or regular timeouts. ， libevent is meant to replace the event loop found in event driven ， network servers. An application just needs to call event_dispatch (  )  ， and then add or remove events dynamically without having to change ， the event loop. Currently , libevent supports /dev/poll , kqueue ( 2 )  ,  ， select ( 2 )  , poll ( 2 ) and epoll ( 4 ) . ， Recently , support for non-blocking DNS resolution was added to ， libevent. ， Description ， A bug exists in the parsing of DNS responses in libevent , specifically ， in the handling of label pointers. Label pointers in DNS are meant to ， cut down on redundant information and overall response size by ， allowing a label to reference an arbitrary byte offset in the packet. ， If a pointer references its own offset , a pointer loop is formed. ， libevent's parsing code does not properly handle such pointer loops. ， Impact ， A malicious resolver , authoritative server , or inline attacker can ， send a DNS reply containing a pointer loop , causing libevent's DNS ， parsing to enter an endless loop , effectively DoS'ing the service. ， Resolution ， Applications utilizing the DNS resolution functionality of libevent ， should upgrade to version >= 1.3. ， Jon Oberheide <jon ( at ) oberheide ( dot ) org [ email concealed ] > ， GnuPG Key : 1024D/F47C17FE ， Fingerprint : B716 DA66 8173 6EDD 28F6 F184 5842 1C89 F47C 17FE",
