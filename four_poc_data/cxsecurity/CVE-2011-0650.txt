It has been identified that this vulnerability allows privilege ， escalation within the OpenVAS Manager but more complex injection may allow ， arbitrary code to be executed with the privileges of the OpenVAS Manager on ， vulnerable systems. CVE-2011-0018 has been assigned to this vulnerability. ， The vulnerable code path is only accessible to authenticated users of OpenVAS ， Manager however it may also be triggered either directly or by using a cross- ， site request forgery based attack via the Greenbone Security Assistant web ， application. ， Current Status ， As of the 20th January 2011, the state of the vulnerabilities is believed to ， be as follows. A patch has been supplied by Greenbone Networks which it ， successfully resolves this vulnerability. New releases of both 1.0.x and 2.0.x ， have also been created which incorporate this patch. Note that the cross-site ， address forgery elements of this vulnerability have not yet been addressed in ， the Greenbone Security Assistant web application. ， Thanks ， OpenVAS would like to thank Ronald Kingma and Alexander van Eee of ISSX for ， their help in reporting the vulnerability. ， Tim Brown ， <mailto:timb (at) openvas (dot) org [email concealed]> ， < ， OpenVAS Security Advisory (OVSA20110118) ， Date: 18th January 2011 ， Product: OpenVAS Manager <= 1.0.3 and 2.0rc2 ， Vendor: OpenVAS < ， Risk: Medium ， Summary ， It has been identified that OpenVAS Manager is vulnerable to command ， injection due to insufficient validation of user supplied data when ， processing OMP requests. It has been identified that this vulnerability ， allows privilege escalation within the OpenVAS Manager but more complex ， injection may allow arbitrary code to be executed with the privileges of ， the OpenVAS Manager on vulnerable systems. CVE-2011-0018 has been assigned ， to this vulnerability. ， The vulnerable code path is only accessible to authenticated users of ， OpenVAS Manager however it may also be triggered either directly or ， by using a cross-site request forgery based attack via the Greenbone ， Security Assistant web application. ， Current Status ， As of the 20th January 2011, the state of the vulnerabilities is believed ， to be as follows. A patch has been supplied by Greenbone Networks which ， it successfully resolves this vulnerability. New releases of both 1.0.x ， and 2.0.x have also been created which incorporate this patch. Note that ， the cross-site address forgery elements of this vulnerability have not ， yet been addressed in the Greenbone Security Assistant web application. ， Technical Details ， It has been identified that OpenVAS Manager is vulnerable to command ， injection due to insufficient validation of user supplied data when ， processing OMP requests. It has been identified that this vulnerability ， allows an authenticated user of the Greenbone Security Assistant web ， application (which communicates with OpenVAS Manager using OMP) to ， escalate their privileges with just a few clicks although more complex ， attacks may also be possible. ， Escalation of privileges can be achieved accessing the Greenbone Security ， Assistant, creating an escalator with a modified POST request as follows: ， Content-Disposition: form-data; name=\"method_data:to_address\" ， none@none>/var/lib/openvas/users/alexander/isadmin ， The processing of this request causes GSA to make a request to OpenVAS Manager ， which causes the command below to be executed with the privileges of the ， OpenVAS Manager (typically root) using the email() function from manage_sql.c: ， command = g_strdup_printf (\"echo \\\" ， \"To: %s\\n\" ， \"From: %s\\n\" ， \"Subject: %s\\n\" ， \"\\n\" ， \"%s\\\" ， \" | /usr/sbin/sendmail %s\" ， \" > /dev/null 2>&1\", ， to_address, ， from_address ? from_address : \"automated (at) openvas (dot) org [email concealed]\", ， subject, ， body, ， to_address); ， . ， As you can see, an attacker can influence both the to and from addresses ， within the concatenated string. The OpenVAS Manager uses the presence ， of the file isadmin to determine the privileges associated with the ， account. ， The vulnerable code path is only accessible to authenticated users of ， OpenVAS Manager however it may also be triggered either directly or ， by using a cross-site request forgery based attack via the Greenbone ， Security Assistant web application. ， Fix ， OpenVAS recommends that the publicly available patches are applied. If ， building from source, then either patch r9974 (trunk) or r9976 (1.0.x) ， should be obtained from the OpenVAS SVN repository. A fresh tarball ， containing the latest stable release can be obtained from: ， r.gz ， In the event that OpenVAS has been supplied as part of a distribution ， then the vendor or organisation concerned should be contacted for a ， patch. ， History ， On 14th January 2011, Ronald Kingma contacted Greenbone Networks to ， report the described vulnerability affecting OpenVAS Manager. ， Greenbone Networks began working on patches to resolve the vulnerability. ， Over the weekend of the 15th and 16th of January, Greenbone Networks ， applied patches to resolve the vulnerability in trunk and the 1.0 ， branch respectively. ， On the 17th, Greenbone Networks contacted the OpenVAS security team ， to notify them of the vulnerability and request assistance in ， coordinating the disclosure. ， The OpenVAS security team, Greenbone Networks and Ronald opened a ， dialogue in order to draft this advisory and on the 18th, CVE-2011-0018 ， was assigned for this vulnerability. ， The OpenVAS security team continued evaluating the vulnerability, ， identifying that it may also be triggered using a cross-site request ， forgery based attack. ， OpenVAS Manager 1.0.4 was released on the 19th. ， Thanks ， OpenVAS would like to thank Ronald Kingma and Alexander van Eee ， of ISSX for their help in reporting the vulnerability."
