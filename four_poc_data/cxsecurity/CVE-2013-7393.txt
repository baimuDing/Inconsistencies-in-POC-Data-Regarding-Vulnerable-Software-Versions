Both of them ， do not take steps to ensure that the file they have been directed at ， is not a symlink. If the pid file is in a directory writeable by ， unprivileged users , the destination could be replaced by a symlink ， allowing for privilege escalation. Both are optional extra tools ， that are not installed by default and do not create a pid file by ， default. ， Known vulnerable :  ， svnwcsub.py and irkerbridge.py included with Subversion 1.8.0 - 1.8.1 , when ， -pidfile is passed , due to an underlying problem in daemonize.py. ， svnwcsub.py included with Subversion 1.8.0 - 1.8.2 when run in ， foreground mode ( as opposed to daemon mode ) when -pidfile is ， passed. ， Known fixed :  ， daemonize.py included with Subversion 1.8.2 or newer. ， svnwcsub.py included with Subversion 1.8.3. ， Subversion 1.7.x and earlier do not include these files and are not ， vulnerable. ， Details :  ， The pid file is often used by scripts to be able to determine if a specific ， service is running and to determine which process to kill to stop a service. ， If the pid file is created in a directory writable by unprivileged ， directories , they could replace it with a symlink. ， If that is done while the service is stopped , the service may overwrite the ， target of the symlink with a one line containing its pid when it starts. ， This may lead to privilege escalation , depending on the target of the ， symlink. ， If that is done while the service is running , the stop script may ， kill the wrong process. In effect the unprivileged user would be able to ， kill a process they do not have permissions to kill when a privileged script ， depends on the pid file. ， Both svnwcsub.py and irkerbridge.py use the daemonize.py module to help ， implement the pidfile feature. This module does not properly ensure that ， the pid file is being created new every time and as such are vulnerable. ， The daemonize.py script has been fixed to resolve this issue and the fixed ， version is included in Subversion 1.8.2. ， svnwcsub.py also supports the -pidfile option when running in the ， foreground and does not depend upon the daemonize.py module to support that ， functionality. The foreground implementation of -pidfile is also ， vulnerable. ， Severity :  ， CVSSv2 Base Score : 2.4 ， CVSSv2 Base Vector : AV : L/AC : H/Au : S/C : N/I : P/A : P ， We consider this to be a low risk vulnerability. ， The tools are not installed by default so most installations are not likely ， to be vulnerable. ， Unless the pid file is created in a directory with permissions for ， unprivileged users the vulnerability cannot be exploited. The init scripts ， provided with Subversion places the pid file in /var/run or a subdirectory ， under /var/run , which is not typically writable by unprivileged users. ， The svnwcsub and irkerbridge services do not run as root by default and so ， the potential privilege escalation is limited. In svnwcsub , a file in one ， of the managed working copies or in their metadata ( .svn ) areas may be ， truncated and replaced with single line containing a pid number. ， The attacker would need to have local access to the machine that the tools ， were running on in order to exploit the vulnerability. ， Recommendations :  ， We recommend that users using svnwcsub.py and irkerbridge.py upgrade their ， installations with the files ( including daemonize.py ) as included in ， Subversion 1.8.3 or newer. ， Administrators can mitigate the vulnerability without upgrading by refraining ， from pointing the pid file at a directory where unprivileged users have write ， access ( e.g. /tmp ) . Instead the pidfile should be placed in a directory ， where only the daemon has access to create , modify , and delete files. ， Alternatively , the pid file may be disabled altogether by removing the ， -pidfile option from the invocation. ， CVE-2013-4262 ( Subversion )  ， Reported by :  ， Daniel Shahaf , Apache Infrastructure ， Patches :  ， Patch for Subversion 1.8 :  ，  [  ， Index : tools/server-side/svnpubsub/daemonize.py ， - tools/server-side/svnpubsub/daemonize.py ( revision 1516272 )  ， + tools/server-side/svnpubsub/daemonize.py ( working copy )  ， -143 , 7 +143 , 14 class Daemon ( object )  :  ，  # the daemon is up and running , so save the pid and return success. ， - open ( self.pidfile , 'w' ) .write ( '%d\\n' % pid )  ， + # Be wary of symlink attacks",
