Ltd. ，  * Title : DiskCryptor Security Model bypass exploiting wrong BIOS API ， usage ，  * Date : 25/08/2008 ，  * Software : DiskCryptor ， - [ Synopsis :  ， The password checking routine of DiskCryptor fails to sanitize the ， BIOS keyboard buffer before AND after reading passwords. ， - [ Affected Software :  ，  * DiskCryptor 0.2.6 for Windows ( possibly other versions also )  ， - [ Technical description :  ， DiskCryptor's pre-boot authentication routines use the BIOS API to ， read user input via the keyboard. The BIOS internally copies the ， keystrokes in a RAM structure called the BIOS Keyboard buffer ， inside the BIOS Data Area. This buffer is not flushed after use ,  ， resulting in potential plain text password leakage once the OS ， is fully booted , assuming the attacker can read the password at ， physical memory location 0x40 : 0x1e. It is also possible for a root ， user to reboot the computer by instrumenting the BIOS keyboard ， buffer in spite of the full disk encryption. ， - [ Impact :  ， 1 ) Plain text password disclosure. ， Required privileges to perform this operation are OS dependant ,  ， from unprivileged users under Windows ( any )  , to root under most ， Unix. ， 2 ) A privileged attacker able to write to the MBR and knowing the ， password ( for instance thanks to 1 )  , is able to reboot the computer ， in spite of the password prompted at boot time ( and in spite of ， disk encryption ) by initializing the BIOS keybaord buffer with the ， correct password ( using an intermediary bootloader that will in turn ， run DiskCryptor ) . ， - [ Full Technical Whitepaper ， - [ Vendor response :  ，  * No Response from vendor in spite of multiple solicitations.",
