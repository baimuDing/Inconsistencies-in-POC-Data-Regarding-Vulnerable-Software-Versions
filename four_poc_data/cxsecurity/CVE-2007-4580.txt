    "text": "vul_name : Security vulnerability in BufferZone 2.5 ， vul_cve : CVE-2007-4580 ， vul_poc : vulnerable software : BufferZone ( all product version ) till version 2.5 ( latest )  ， type of vulnerability : DoS , potential privilege escalation ， I found a vulnerability in BufferZone which allows an unprivileged user and even a malicious software running inside the BufferZone sandbox to crash the system and potentially run arbitrary code with kernel privileges. ， The issue is within the kernel driver redlight.sys which does not properly validate file buffer. Sending the IOCTL code FsSetVolumeInformation with subcode FsSetDirectoryInformation with a large buffer but underreporting its size with at most 1024 bytes results in a buffer underrun which might also lead to executing arbitrary code. ， Since the RedLight device is also visible to sandboxed application , it might allow a sandboxed malware to escape the sandbox.",
