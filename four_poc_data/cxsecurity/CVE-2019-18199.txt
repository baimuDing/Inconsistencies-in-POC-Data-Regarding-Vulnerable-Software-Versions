This durable keyboard set is equipped with secure ， 2.4 GHz technology and plug and play technology. The elegant mouse ， works on most surfaces due to its precise 1000 dpi sensor. It offers ， fabulous features and ultra slim , portable design.\" ， Due to an insecure implementation of the data communication , the ， wireless keyboard LX390 is vulnerable to replay attacks. ， Vulnerability Details :  ， SySS GmbH found out that the wireless keyboard Fujitsu LX390 is prone to ， replay attacks. ， An attacker can simply sniff the data packets of the 2.4 GHz radio ， communication sent by the keyboard to the receiver ( USB dongle ) and ， replay the recorded communication data at will causing the same effect ， as the original data communication. ， A replay attack against the keyboard can , for example , be used to gain ， unauthorized access to a computer system that is operated with a ， vulnerable Fujitsu LX390 keyboard. In this attack scenario , an attacker ， records the radio communication during a password-based user ， authentication of his or her victim , for instance during a login to the ， operating system or during unlocking a screen lock. At an opportune ， moment when the victim's computer system is unattended , the attacker ， approaches the victim's computer and replays the previously recorded ， data communication for the password-based user authentication and ， thereby gets unauthorized access to the victim's system. ， Proof of Concept ( PoC )  :  ， SySS GmbH could successfully perform a replay attack as described in the ， previous section using a software-defined radio in combination with the ， software tool GNU Radio Companion. ， It was also possible to perform successful replay attacks using an ， in-house developed software tool in combination with the USB radio ， dongle Crazyradio PA and the nrf-research-firmware by Bastille Networks ， Internet Security written by Marc Newlin ( see [ 3 ] and [ 4 ]  ) .",
