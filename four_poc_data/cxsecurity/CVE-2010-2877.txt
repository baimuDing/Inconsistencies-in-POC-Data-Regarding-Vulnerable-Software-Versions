User interaction is ， required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a ， malicious page or open a malicious file. ， The specific flaw exists within IML32X.dll and DIRAPIX.dll which are ， responsible for parsing the Director movies , a RIFF-based file format. ， The code trusts a value from the file as a count and performs an ， endian-flipping loop on data in heap memory. If the value is large ， enough the process can be made to seek outside the bounds of the ， allocation and thus corrupt memory in a controlled fashion. This can be ， leveraged by an attacker to execute arbitrary code under the context of ， the user running the web browser.",
