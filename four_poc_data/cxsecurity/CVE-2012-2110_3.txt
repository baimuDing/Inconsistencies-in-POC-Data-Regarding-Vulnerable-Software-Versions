For symmetric key algorithms in CBC mode , the IV for the first record is generated using keys and secrets set during the SSL or TLS handshake. All subsequent records are encrypted using the ciphertext block from the previous record as the IV. With symmetric key encryption in CBC mode , plain text encrypted with the same IV and key generates the same cipher text , which is why having a variable IV is important. ， The BEAST exploit uses this SSLv3 and TLS v1.0 vulnerability by allowing an attacker to observe the last ciphertext block , which is the IV , then replace this with an IV of their choice , inject some of their own plain text data , and when this new IV is used to encrypt the data , the attacker can guess the plain text data one byte at a time. ， CVSSv2 Base Score : 4.3 ( AV : N/AC : M/Au : N/C : P/I : N/A : N )  ， 2.Buffer overflow vulnerability ( CVE-2012-2110/CVE-2012-2131 )  ， SSL-C contains code that does not properly interpret integer data , which could allow buffer overflow attacks using crafted DER ( Distinguished Encoding Rules ) data , such as in X.509 certificate or an RSA asymmetric key. ， CVSSv2 Base Score : 7.5 ( AV : N/AC : L/Au : N/C : P/I : P/A : P )  ， Recommendation :  ， For BEAST ( Browser Exploit Against SSL/TLS ) attack :  ， The best way to help prevent this attack is to use TLS v1.1. The vulnerability to do with IV generation was fixed in TLS v1.1 ( released in 2006 ) so implementations using only TLS v1.1 are engineered to be secure against the BEAST exploit. However , support for this higher level protocol is limited to a smaller number of applications , so supporting only TLS v1.1 might cause interoperability issues.",
