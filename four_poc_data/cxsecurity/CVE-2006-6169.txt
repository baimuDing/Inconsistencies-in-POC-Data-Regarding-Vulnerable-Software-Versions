    "text": "vul_name : GnuPG 1.4 and 2.0 buffer overflow ， vul_cve : CVE-2006-6169 ， vul_poc : GnuPG 1.4 and 2.0 buffer overflow ， Summary ， While fixing a bug reported by Hugh Warrington , a buffer overflow has ， been identified in all released GnuPG versions. The current versions ， 1.4.5 and 2.0.0 are affected. A small patch is provided. ， Please do not send private mail in response to this message. The ， mailing list gnupg-devel is the best place to discuss this problem ，  ( please subscribe first so you don't need moderator approval [ 1 ]  ) . ， Impact ， When running GnuPG interactively , special crafted messages may be used ， to crash gpg or gpg2. Running gpg in batch mode , as done by all ， software using gpg as a backend ( e.g. mailers )  , is not affected by ， this bug. ， Exploiting this overflow seems to be possible. ， gpg-agent , gpgsm , gpgv or other tools from the GnuPG suite are not ， affected. ， Solution ， Apply the following patch to GnuPG. It should apply cleanly to ， current versions ( 1.4.5 as well as 2.0.0 ) but might also work for ， older versions. ， 2006-11-27 Werner Koch <wk ( at ) g10code ( dot ) com [ email concealed ] > ，  * openfile.c ( ask_outfile_name )  : Fixed buffer overflow occurring ， - g10/openfile.c ( revision 4348 )  ， + g10/openfile.c ( working copy )  ， -144 , 8 +144 , 8 ， s = _ ( \"Enter new filename\" )  ;  ， - n = strlen ( s ) + namelen + 10 ;  ， defname = name namelen? make_printable_string ( name , namelen , 0 )  : NULL ;  ， + n = strlen ( s ) + ( defname?strlen ( defname )  : 0 ) + 10 ;  ， prompt = xmalloc ( n )  ;  ， sprintf ( prompt , \"%s [ %s ]  : \" , s , defname )  ;  ， Background :  ， The code in question has been introduced on July 1 , 1999 and is a ， pretty obvious bug. make_printable_string is supposed to replace ， possible dangerous characters from a prompt and returns a malloced ， string. Thus this string may be longer than the orginal one ; the ， buffer for the prompt has only be allocated at the size of the original ， string - oops. Note , that using snprintf would not have helped in ， this case. How I wish C-90 had introduced asprintf or at least it ， would be available on more platforms. ， The original bug report is at . ，  [ 1 ] See . ， Werner Koch <wk ( at ) gnupg ( dot ) org [ email concealed ] > ， The GnuPG Experts ， Join the Fellowship and protect your Freedom !
