    "text": "vul_name : OpenSAML Java ParserPool and Decrypter Vulnerable To XML Attacks ， vul_cve : CVE-2013-6440 ， vul_poc : OpenSAML-J Security Advisory [ 13 December 2013 ]  ， OpenSAML Java ParserPool and Decrypter Vulnerable To XML Attacks ， OpenSAML Java ships with a couple of implementations of the ParserPool ， interface ( org.opensaml.xml.parse.BasicParserPool and ， org.opensaml.xml.parse.StaticBasicParserPool ) . Due to pool ， configuration parameters set by the default constructor , both ， implementations are vulnerable to a variety of XML attacks , both ， denial-of-service and information disclosure. The latter are often ， referred to as XML External Entity ( XE ) attacks. ， Both categories of attacks leverage the use of the XML DOCTYPE ， declaration. Note that use of DOCTYPE is neither typical nor needed ， in SAML processing cases. ， Additionally , the XML and SAML Decrypter implementations ，  ( org.opensaml.xml.encryption.Decrypter and ， org.opensaml.saml2.encryption.Decrypter respectively ) use an ， internally constructed ParserPool instance which is vulnerable to the ， same types of attacks. ， Note that the Shibboleth IdP , which makes use of OpenSAML Java , is not ， vulnerable to these attacks in any supported version , because : 1 ) the ， ParserPool instance used is configured per the recommendations below ， 2 ) the IdP does not support decryption and does not use the OpenSAML ， Decrypter. ， Affected Versions ， Versions of OpenSAML Java < 2.6.1 ， Recommendations ， If you are using either OpenSAML Decrypter implementation , in version ， 2.6.0 and earlier : There is no mechanism for injecting or configuring ， the ParserPool used. In this case , it is recommended that you upgrade ， to OpenSAML version 2.6.1 or higher as soon as possible. ， If you are not using the OpenSAML Decrypter :  ， It is always recommended that ParserPool instances be configured ， appropriately , being mindful of application and security requirements. ， When using a ParserPool for SAML or other XML processing use cases ， where DOCTYPE and external entities are not used , the following ， miminum ParserPool configuration is recommended :  ， 1 ) set pool property 'expandEntity ， 2 ) set feature 'javax.xml.XMLConstants.FEATURE_SECURE_PROCESSING' to ， true ， 3 ) set feature ' ， to true ，  # 1 and # 2 should be supported by all JAXP implementations. ，  # 3 is a Xerces-specific feature , including derivatives such as the ， internal JAXP implementations supplied with the Oracle and OpenJDK ， JREs. For other JAXP implementations , consult the documentation for ， the implementation for guidance on how to achieve a similar ， configuration. ， Configuring the ParserPool instance per the above is sufficient to ， mitigate these kinds of XML attacks in OpenSAML Java 2.6.0 and ， earlier. ， Also , take special note that MessageDecoder implementations which are ， subclasses of org.opensaml.ws.message.decoder.BaseMessageDecoder will ， by default use an insecure internal ParserPool. It is recommended ， that an appropriately configured ParserPool instance always be ， supplied at construction time for such MessageDecoder instances. ， In order to make the OpenSAML ParserPool implementations immune to ， these types of attack by default , the default parameters at ， construction time have been updated per the above for OpenSAML ， versions 2.6.1 and higher. Note that if you are supplying your own ， feature map to the ParserPool , this map overrides the default feature ， map and you will need to explicitly include the above features in your ， supplied feature map. ， Credits ， David Illsley ( affiliation unknown )  ， Ron Gutierrez , Gotham Digital Science ， David Jorm , Red Hat Security Response Team ， URL for this Security Advisory ， This advisory has been assigned CVE-2013-6440 by the National ， Vulnerability Database.",
