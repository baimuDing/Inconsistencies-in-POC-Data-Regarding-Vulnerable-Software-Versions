A remote authenticated administrator can execute arbitrary SQL commands in application's database. These vulnerabilities could also be exploited by a remote non-authenticated attacker via CSRF vector , since the application is prone to cross-site request forgery attacks. In order to do so an attacker should trick the logged-in administrator to visit a web page with CSRF exploit. ， 1.1 Vulnerability exists due to insufficient sanitation of input passed via the \"search_string\" HTTP GET parameter to the index.php script. A remote authenticated administrator can execute arbitrary SQL commands in application's database. ， Depending on database and system configuration , this PoC code will create a /tmp/file.txt file , containing MySQL server version :  ， The second PoC demonstrates exploitation of the same vulnerability via CSRF vector : ",
