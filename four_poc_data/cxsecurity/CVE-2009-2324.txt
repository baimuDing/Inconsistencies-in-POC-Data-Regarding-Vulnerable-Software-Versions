The ， affected code is remotely exposed before authentication. An attacker can ， exploit this vulnerability to install remote shells on the victim server ， among other things , it should be noted that this vulnerability is being ， actively exploited in the wild. ， Additionally several XSS vulnerabilities are present in the packaged samples ， directory. ， A patch and a new FCKeditor version will be made available on Monday July 6th ， 16 : 00 CET , this advisory will be updated with detailed information about the ， issue and a security patch. ， In the meantime we strongly recommend to implement the following ， mitigation instructions :  ，  * removed unused connectors from 'editor\\filemanager\\connectors' ，  * disable the file browser in config.ext ，  * inspect all fckeditor folders on the server for suspicious files that ， may have been previously uploaded , as an example image directories ，  ( eg. 'fckeditor/editor/images/.' ) are well known target locations ，  * completely remove the '_samples' directory ， Affected version :  ， FCKeditor <= 2.6.4 ，  ( version 3.0 is unaffected as it does not have any built-in file browser )  ， Fixed version :  ， FCKeditor >= 2.6.4.1 ( to be released on 2009-07-06 16 : 00 CET )  ， Credit : vulnerability report received from Vinny Guido <bigvin [ at ]  ， hushmail [ dot ] com>. ， CVE : CVE-2009-2265",
