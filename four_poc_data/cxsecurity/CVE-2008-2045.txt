The flaw is caused due to a lack of ， input filtering in the SugarCRM RSS module , which can be exploited ， to disclose the content of local files. ， The RSS module allows SugarCRM users to add RSS feeds to their personal ， RSS list. The application expects an URL value pointing to a valid RSS ， feed. ， However , the URL variable value is not properly sanitised and any URI ， value can be entered instead. In this particular case , it was discovered ， that it is possible to enter a file path to any files on the local ， system hosting the SugarCRM application. ， As a result SugarCRM does not display the new RSS feed in the list as it ， is not a valid RSS URL Feed. However , the application creates a local ， file with the filename of the md5 hash of the URL entered. The file is ， created in the directory cache/feeds . If the Apache web server is used ,  ， the file is created with the user www-data containing read permission. ， = Exploitation = ， An exploitation example in a LAMP ( Linux , Apache , Mysql , PHP )  ， environment :  ， If an authenticated attacker enters a value of ?/etc/passwd? ，  ( without quotes ) in the RSS URL field , the application will generate a ， MD5 hash of the string containing the file path. In this case ,  ， the value ?/etc/passwd? is hashed to ?c5068b7c2b1707f8939b283a2758a691 ， ? ( without quotes ) . The MD5 hash is then used as a filename with the ， file contents of /etc/passwd. The file /etc/passwd can then be viewable ， publicly at ， 83a2758a691 .",
