An important thing here is that we can't rely on the shared hosts MySQLds local-infile=0 option. This because of it being a server option , so it will not have any effect on the client. To disable this option for MySQL we need to compile libmysqlclient with -disable-local-infile , or remove the CLIENT_LOCAL_FILES flag while connecting. PHP does this when open_basedir are in effect but lacks a check for safe_mode. ， For MySQLi compiling with -disable-local-infile won't help because we could just reenable it with mysqli->options ( MYSQLI_OPT_LOCAL_INFILE , 1 )  ;  ， Proof Of Concepts :  ， MySQL : ",
