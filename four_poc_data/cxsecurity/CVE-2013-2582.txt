The vendor has chosen a responsible full disclosure method to publish security issue details. Users of the software have already been provided with patched versions. German law prohibits to provide code that may be used by attackers , therefor no PoC or working code is available within this advisory. ， Proof regarding the authenticity of these issues can be obtained from the published release notes :  ， Product : Open-Xchange Server 6 , OX AppSuite ， Vendor : Open-Xchange GmbH ， Internal reference : 25140 ， Vulnerability type : HTTP Header Injection ， Vulnerable versions : 6.22.0-rev1 to 7.0.2-rev6 ， Vulnerable component : backend ， Fixed version : 6.22.0-rev15 , 6.22.1-rev17 , 7.0.1-rev6 , 7.0.2-rev7 ， Solution status : Fixed by Vendor ， Vendor notification : 2013-03-04 ， Solution date : 2013-04-04 ， Public disclosure : 2013-04-17 ， CVE reference : CVE-2013-2582 ， CVSSv2 : 6.2 ( AV : N/AC : L/Au : N/C : N/I : P/A : N/E : P/RL : U/RC : C/CDP : LM/TD : H/CR : ND/IR : ND/AR : ND )  ， Vulnerability Details :  ， The redirect servlet of the application uses the location variable , that specifies which URL a user gets redirected to. The application performs various replacements to protect a user against HTTP Header Injection. However , these replacements can be used by an attacker to create a situation where the replace-procedure creates a redirection string. When passing an encoded URL to the location parameter of the \"redirect\" servlet , null-characters ( like ?%0d? ) are replace by a empty string ( ? ) and effectively creates the sequence ( ?/? ) which is interpreted by the browser as ? ， Risk :  ， Users may be tricked to visit a malicious website embedded to a trustworthy URL.",
