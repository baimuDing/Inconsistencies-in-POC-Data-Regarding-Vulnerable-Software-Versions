    "text": "vul_name : Aruba Mobility Controller Shared Default Certificate ， vul_cve : CVE-2008-7023 ， vul_poc : Aruba Mobility Controller Shared Default Certificate ， Product :  ， Aruba Mobility Controller ， Aruba mobility controllers use X.509 certificates to protect access to the web management interface and to provide secure wireless authentication , such as TLS , TTLS , PEAP , and Aruba-specific Captive Portal. By default the controller uses a built-in certificate that is shared by all deployed units across all customers. Administrators are not forced to generate new , implementation-specific key pairs to replace this shared one. ， Since the corresponding private key is not protected in any particular way it is possible for a party with access to one of the controllers to retrieve the private key and abuse it to compromise other implementations. ， The latest such certificate is serial number 386929 issued by Equifax Secure Certificate Authority , expiring Jun 30 , 2011. ， The vulnerability has been identified in ArubaOS version 3.3.1.16 but all previous versions are also likely affected.",
