The ， same day ,  ， we reported this vulnerability to mitre.org and the CVE was assigned. ， We were ， able to get in touch with the vendor with a confirmed response relatively ， quickly ( May 29 ) . ， We attempted to contact them again on June 4 and June 17. They have not ， since ， responded. ， Since then there have been multiple pushes and merges to the project's ， master ， branch on github ; the security issue still has not been addressed ， despite the ， fix being a single , simple line of code. This copy-paste fix could have ， been ， implemented extremely quickly and easily and the vendor has pushed many ， updates since their notification. When initially disclosing this , we gave ， them a time period of 14 days before we would publish it. Because they ， responded to us positively , we gave them extra time to fix it. At this ， point ,  ， seeing that they continue to update the software past the 14 day window ， without implementing a ten second fix leaves us little alternative to our ， present course of action. ， As per our Actionable Intelligence Must Beget Overzealous Timing ( AIMBOT )  ， policy , this report is being released in the hopes that vendor ， negligence and ， potential incompetence may be appropriately addressed. Responsible ， disclosure ， includes the responsibility to be transparent with consumers and the ， responsibility to consumers to prevent them from being harmed. ， Before we get into any specific vulnerability , we would like to ， compliment this ， vendor on their UI development. The responsive HTML5 layout is ， certainly an ， excellent piece of code. ， While the vendor has amazing interface developers , their database ， architects ， are as poor at databasing as their UI developers are good at interfacing. ， Our initial analysis of the software in question , including ， CVE-2014-3868 and ， several other vulnerabilities follows below. Weaponized exploit samples ， this software will NOT be made available by ourselves , as weaponizing ， exploits ， affecting this type of application is contrary to the spirit of consumer ， protection. We will attempt to provide diffs for each thing we were ， able to ， easily patch at the end of this document ; however this is not a ， guarantee of ， the future safety of this third-party-patched product. ， - CVE-2014-3868 - ， Assigned :  ， 27 May 2014 ( Submitted to Vendor May 29 )  ， Status :  ， Vendor Ignored , see suggested fix below. ， Classification :  ， Blind SQL Injection ， Exploit Complexity :  ， Low ， Severity :  ， High ， Description :  ， Blind SQL injection vector exists in the current addtocart ， functionality ， Required information for attack to be successful :  ，  * valid product id ，  * valid session ID ， PoC :  ，  * Requires a valid sessionid and numeric product id. ，  * The following bash commands causes the target page to sleep for 13 ， seconds , while the expected inputs have a near-instant response time :  ，  # export SESSID=\"YOURSESSIONID , CHANGE THIS\" ;  ，  # export PROD_ID=\"Numeric Product ID\" ;  ，  # time curl -d \"addtocart= $ {PROD_ID}\" -b \"PHPSESSID= $ {SESSID}\" \\ ， \" and ， sleep ( 1 ) \" ， Suggested Action :  ， At the top of CAddCart.php , line 32 ( just after the comments and ， before the",
