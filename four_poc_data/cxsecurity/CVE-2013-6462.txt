Testing in X servers built with Stack Protector resulted ， in an immediate crash when reading a user-provided specially crafted font. ， As libXfont is used to read user-specified font files in all X servers ， distributed by X.Org , including the Xorg server which is often run with ， root privileges or as setuid-root in order to access hardware , this bug ， may lead to an unprivileged user acquiring root privileges in some systems. ， Affected Versions ， This bug appears to have been introduced in the initial RCS version 1.1 ， checked in on 1991/05/10 , and is thus believed to be present in every X11 ， release starting with X11R5 up to the current libXfont 1.4.6. ，  ( Manual inspection shows it is present in the sources from the X11R5 ， tarballs , but not in those from the X11R4 tarballs. )  ， Fixes ， A fix is available via the attached patch , which is also included in ， libXfont 1.4.7 , released today , and available in the libXfont git repo :  ， Thanks ， X.Org thanks the authors of the cppcheck tool for making their static ， analyzer available as an open source project we can all benefit from. ， -Alan Coopersmith- alan.coopersmith at oracle.com ， X.Org Security Response Team - xorg-security at lists.x.org ， - next part - ， From 4d024ac10f964f6bd372ae0dd14f02772a6e5f63 Mon Sep 17 00 : 00 : 00 2001 ， From : Alan Coopersmith <alan.coopersmith at oracle.com> ， Date : Mon , 23 Dec 2013 18 : 34 : 02 -0800 ， Subject :  [ PATCH : libXfont ] CVE-2013-6462 : unlimited sscanf overflows stack ， buffer in bdfReadCharacters (  )  ， Fixes cppcheck warning :  ，  [ lib/libXfont/src/bitmap/bdfread.c : 341 ]  :  ( warning )  ， scanf without field width limits can crash with huge input data. ， Signed-off-by : Alan Coopersmith <alan.coopersmith at oracle.com> ， Reviewed-by : Matthieu Herrb <matthieu at herrb.eu> ， Reviewed-by : Jeremy Huddleston Sequoia <jeremyhu at apple.com> ， src/bitmap/bdfread.c | 2 +- ， 1 file changed , 1 insertion ( + )  , 1 deletion ( - )  ， diff -git a/src/bitmap/bdfread.c b/src/bitmap/bdfread.c ， index e2770dc.e11c5d2 100644 ， - a/src/bitmap/bdfread.c ， + b/src/bitmap/bdfread.c ， -338 , 7 +338 , 7 bdfReadCharacters ( FontFilePtr file , FontPtr pFont , bdfFileState * pState ,  ， char charName [ 100 ]  ;  ， int ignore ;  ， - if ( sscanf ( char *  ) line , \"STARTCHAR %s\" , charName )  ! = 1 ) { ， + if ( sscanf ( char *  ) line , \"STARTCHAR %99s\" , charName )  ! = 1 ) { ， bdfError ( \"bad character name in BDF file\\n\" )  ;  ， goto BAILOUT ; / * bottom of function , free and return error * / ， } ， 1.7.9.2",
