    "text": "vul_name : MySQL - 5.0.88 Multiple Vulnerabalities ， vul_cve : CVE-2009-4019 , CVE-2009-4028 ， vul_poc : MySQL upstream has released latest 5.0.88 version of their Community Server ,  ， fixing one security issue :  ， Security Fix : MySQL clients linked against OpenSSL did not ， check server certificates presented by a server linked against ， yaSSL. ( Bug # 47320 :  ， While the other two ( three issues ) looks too to be security relevant :  ，  * Error handling was missing for SELECT statements containing ， subqueries in the WHERE clause and that assigned a SELECT ， result to a user variable. The server could crash as a result. ，  ( Bug # 48291 :  ， This looks to be from adjacent network exploitable mysqld DoS. ，  * If the first argument to GeomFromWKB (  ) function was a geometry ， value , the function just returned its value. However , it ， failed to preserve the argument's null_value flag , which ， caused an unexpected NULL value to be returned to the caller ,  ， resulting in a server crash. ，  ( Bug # 47780 :  ， Same case as the above , though I can't look into upstream MySQL bugs ， to confirm or disprove it. Thus Cc-ed Sergei Golubchik on this mail. ，  * Failure to treat BIT values as unsigned could lead to ， unpredictable results. ，  ( Bug # 42803 :  ， Also this one seems to be security related - upstream bug speaks about ， invalid memory access and didn't check the code if this could ， lead to heap overflow once the comparison fails. ， Sergei , our opinion here is appreciated. ， Thanks Regards , Jan. ， Jan iankko Lieskovsky / Red Hat Security Response Team",
