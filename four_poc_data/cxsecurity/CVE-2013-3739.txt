VULNERABILITY - ， Local File Inclusion in Weathermap <= 0.97C ， II. BACKGROUND - ， Network Weathermap is a network visualisation tool , to take data you already have and show you an overview of your network in map form. Support is built in for RRD , MRTG ( RRD and old log-format )  , and tab-delimited text files. Other sources are via plugins or external scripts. ， III. DESCRIPTION - ， Network Weathermap 0.97C and lower versions contain a flaw that allows a local file inclusion attack.

This allows an attacker to create a specially crafted URL to include any \".config\" file on the web server , you can bypass the \".config\" restriction filter with a php bug. ， the editor.php must be enabled to successfully exploit. ， IV. PROOF OF CONCEPT - ， LFI :  ， V. BUSINESS IMPACT - ， LFI : With a php bug we can include any file that the webserver has right to read , including sensitive config files ( php file too , because it's not executed but read with fopen ) . ， VI. SYSTEMS AFFECTED - ， Network Weathermap 0.97C and lower versions ， VII. SOLUTION - ， sanitize correctly the mapname parameter. ， TEMP SOLUTION : disable editor.php ， VIII. REFERENCES - ， IX.
