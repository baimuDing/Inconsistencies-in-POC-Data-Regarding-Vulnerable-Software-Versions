This issue has ， been fixed [ 2 ] in >= GNUTLS-3.0.14. I hacked on it for hours and figure out ， a few prerequisites could make it vulnerable :  ， REQUIRED :  ， - prior to GNUTLS 3.0.14 ， - crafted certificate ， Attacking SCENES ， - a client import a crafted cert file for sending req to server ( CA? )  ， - a \"server\" import a crafted cert file for sending req to other ， server ( CA? )  ， -> With high frequency uses above manipulations ， Stand on the client side , the attacker should try to construct a ， crafted certificate for triggering the below function fails :  ， ret = gnutls_pubkey_import_x509 ( pcert->pubkey , crt , 0 )  ;  ， { ， gnutls_pubkey_deinit ( pcert->pubkey )  ;  ， / * pcert->pubkey should be NULL now * / ， ret = gnutls_assert_val ( ret )  ;  ， goto cleanup ;  ， } ， I made up two crafted cert files ( client.pem , client2.pem ) seems would ， trigger the double free issue in client's side. ， Warning : Don't try it on your host machine because it would cost too ， much memory then makes your machine very slow. ， shawn @ sl13 :  ~ /gnutls_compile_uses/CVE-2012-1663 $ ./ex-serv-x509 ， processing server set to null? ， Server ready.
