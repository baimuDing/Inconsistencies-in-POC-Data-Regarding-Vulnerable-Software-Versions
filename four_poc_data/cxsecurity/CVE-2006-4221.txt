This is the second vulnerability found in ， this control by eEye Research , the first being from Drew Copley ，  ( This ， control is typically installed by default on IBM workstations and ， laptops , and is used by default for auto-finding drivers/updates on ， IBM's/Lenovo's support site. ， IBM / Lenovo describes this ActiveX control as follows :  ， \"The auto-detect feature automatically finds your system's machine-type ,  ， model , and serial number to help you get the files and information you ， need quickly and easily. * It does not collect any personal information ， or compromise the security of your system in any way. * \" ， Despite their promise for not \"comprimising the security of the system ， in any way\" , a buffer overflow exists within the handling of a parameter ， of the ActiveX control that would allow a remote attacker to reliably ， overwrite the stack with arbitrary data and execute arbitrary code ， through the web browser with the privileges of the logged in user. ， Technical Details :  ， The vulnerability exists within the RunEgatherer functionwithin the ， ActiveX. This method accepts one function , the specified file name for ， the eGatherer log output. It should be noted that even when setting the ， parameter with legitimate paths for output , the ActiveX remains to only ， write the log file to the SystemDrive. By filling the single paramater ， with a large string , a straight stack overflow occurs. The following",
