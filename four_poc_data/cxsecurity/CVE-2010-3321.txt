This potential vulnerability is corrected in RSA Authentication Client 3.5.3. ， Description: ， CVE Identifier: CVE-2010-3321 ， RSA Authentication Client can be used to store secret key objects on an RSA SecurID 800 hybrid authenticator using the PKCS#11 API. According to PKCS#11 specifications, secret key objects tagged as SENSITIVE and NON-EXTRACTABLE cannot be exported from the device. This option safeguards against the possibility of a key being used in a manner for which it was not originally intended by the developer of the application (e.g., a user copying the key to another device). Affected versions of RSA Authentication Client ignore the SENSITIVE and NON-EXTRACTABLE tags for secret key objects and allow these objects to be extracted by a properly authenticated user. ， Affected Products: ， Any version of RSA Authentication Client used only with RSA SecurID 800 authenticators to store secret key objects tagged as SENSITIVE and NON-EXTRACTABLE. ， Platforms: ， Includes all OS versions of RSA Authentication Client ， Unaffected Products: ， The following RSA Authentication Client and RSA SecurID 800 use cases are NOT impacted by this vulnerability: ， * Use of the SecurID 800 authenticator as an RSA SecurID one-time passcode (OTP) generator ， * Secure storage of digital certificates or other asymmetric keys ， * Secure storage of secret key objects that are intended to be extractable (e.g., password storage) ， Recommendation: ， Customers using RSA Authentication Client and PKCS#11 to store SENSITIVE and NON-EXTRACTABLE secret key objects on RSA SecurID 800 authenticators should upgrade to RSA Authentication Client 3.5.3 as soon as possible. Customers using RSA Authentication Client and the RSA SecurID 800 authenticator for any other purposes are not impacted by this announcement and do not need to upgrade at this time. ， Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) Base Score: ， The Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) score for the item identified in this advisory is 1.5 (AV:L/AC:M/Au:S/C:P/I:N/A:N).
