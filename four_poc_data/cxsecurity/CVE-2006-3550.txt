INTRODUCTION ， F5 FirePass is an appliance which allows a remote communication between ， SSL-VPN endpoints. This secure connectivity to corporate applications ， and data is provided using a standard web browser. ， More Information are available on the official FirePass product web site ， at the following URL :  ， II. DESCRIPTION ， Marc Ruef found several cross site scripting vulnerabilities in the F5 ， FirePass 4100 prior 6.x - Other versions might be affected too. ， Some writable form fields and hidden fields can be tricked by using ， hyphens to include and execute mobile script code. This flaw can be used ， to pass the code into another users browser session. [ 1 ]  ， III. EXPLOITATION ， Classic script injection techniques within a browser session can be used ， to exploit this vulnerability. ， A plugin for our open-source exploiting framework \"Attack Tool Kit\" ，  ( ATK ) will be published in the near future. [ 2 ]  ， IV. IMPACT ， Because authentication frontends are affected too , this vulnerability is ， serious for every secure environment. Non-authenticated users might be ， able to exploit this flaw to gain elevated privileges ( e.g. extracting ， sensitive cookie information or launch a buffer overflow attack against ， another web browser ) . ， V. DETECTION ， Detection of web based attacks requires a specialized web proxy and/or ， intrusion detection system. Patterns for such a detection are available ， and easy to implement. ， VI. SOLUTION ， The vulnerabilities have been identified in version 5.x. The remaining ， existence of them could not be verified in version 6.x. ， VII. VENDOR RESPONSE ， F5 has not been informed because it looks like they have already fixed ， the problem in version 6.x. ， VIII.
