CVE-2011-2577 ( CSCtq46500 )  ， Details. ， Cisco TelePresence is an umbrella term for Video Conferencing Hardware ， and Software , Infrastructure and Endpoints. The C & MXP Series are the ， Endpoints used on desks or in boardrooms to provide users with a ， termination point for Video Conferencing. ， 1. Post-authentication HTML Injection - CVE-2011-2544 ( CSCtq46488 )  :  ， Cisco TelePresence Endpoints have a web interface ( HTTP or HTTPS ) for ， managing , configuring and reporting. It is possible to set the Call ID ，  ( with H.323 or SIP ) to a HTML value. If a call is made to another ， endpoint and an authenticated user browses to the web interface on the ， endpoint receiving the call ( e.g. to view call statistics )  , the ， HTML will render locally within the context of the logged in user. From ， this point it is possible to make changes to the system as the ， authenticated user. The flaw is due to the flexibility of the H.323 ID ， or SIP Display Name fields and failure to correctly validate user input. ， Examples ( MXP )  :  ， Rebooting the system : <IMG SRC=\"/reboot&Yes=please\"> ， The attacker may also choose to change passwords in the system , disable ， encryption or enable telnet :  ， <IMG SRC=/html_select_status?reload=other.ssi&telnet=On> ， <IMG SRC=/html_select_status?reload=security.ssi&/Configuration/ ， Conference/Encryption/Mode=Off&/Configuration/SystemUnit/Password=test> ， 2. Post-authentication Memory Corruption - CVE-2011-2543 ( CSCtq46496 )  :  ， Cisco TelePresence systems ( Endpoints and Infrastructure ) use XPath for ， setting and getting configuration. ， Example syntax is :  ， The request is sent to a locally listening shell ( tshell ) . This is the ， case for all requests relating to performing an action on the system ( e.g. ， config get or set ) . The shell then sends the input to the \"main\" ， application ( /app/main , id=0 )  , and the data is passed as a parameter. ， It was discovered that the getXML handle does not properly perform ， length checking on the user supplied input before passing it to the ， tshell. Furthermore , there is no length checking performed in the tshell ， and no bounds checking performed in the main application where the ， parameter is consumed. As such , it is possible to send input that ， exceeds the size of the receiving buffer , subsequently causing an ， invalid address to be read. This causes a reboot on the Endpoints. The ， VCS will not reboot , the process will crash by SIGSEGV ( or sigabrt ) but ， it will restart the process itself which drops all calls.",
