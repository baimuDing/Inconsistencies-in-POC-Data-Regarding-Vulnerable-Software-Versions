Summary ， Vendor : BlackBerry ， Products known to be affected : Blackberry Z10 ，  ( model STL100-2 , Software release : 10.1.0.2312 ,  ， OS version : 10.1.0.2354 , Build ID : 524717 )  ， Severity : Medium ， Remote exploitable : Yes ， CVE : CVE-2014-2389 ， qconndoor is a network service , running on the Blackberry Z10 ， to allow developers to access the device using BlackBerry's SDK ， tool-chain. The qconndoor process is used to e. g. enable SSH access ， to the device ; More functionality is not documented yet and may ， remain proprietary. Even though the service is intended for being ， used by software developers in the Blackberry developer-mode only ,  ， the service is still running , even if the developer-mode is not ， enabled. The qconndoor process is executed under super-user UID 0 ，  ( root ) privileges. ， modzero identified a stack-based buffer overflow in the qconnDoor ， service that can be triggered by an unauthenticated attacker. The ， buffer overflow issue can only be triggered , if the developer-mode ， has been activated once during runtime and can still be triggered ， when the developer-mode has been turned off. Since the developer ， service is exposed to the ( wireless ) network and the service is ， running with administrative privileges , the risk of a successful ， exploitation is considered high after the developer-mode has been ， turned on and off during runtime once. ， Even if exploit mitigations at first prevent a code execution , it is ， still possible to modify data variables in the affected services ,  ， which is a high risk , too. ， 3. Details ， To overflow the stack-buffer in qconnDoor , an attacker has to send a ， single specially crafted packet with any command code that triggers ， AES-decryption of the data payload ( for example , command code # 7 ) . By ， specifying an invalid combination of encrypted and decrypted payload ， lengths , the decryption routine will write past the end of the ， decrypted plaintext buffer. qconnDoor will terminate immediately ,  ， because processing the packet causes a modification of the stack ， cookie , which the process detects. ，  $ perl -e 'print \"\\x00\\x2a\\x00\\x02\\x00\\x07\\x12\\x00\\x0c\\x00\" . \"\\x41\" x 0xc00' |  ， nc target.host 4455",
