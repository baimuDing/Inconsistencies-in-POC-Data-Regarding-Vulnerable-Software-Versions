The vulnerabilities allow an attacker to construct Groovy scripts that escape the sandbox and execute shell commands as the user running the Elasticsearch Java VM. ， We have been assigned CVE-2015-1427 for this. ， Fixed versions :  ， Versions 1.3.8 and 1.4.3 disable sandboxing for Groovy by default. As a consequence , dynamic script execution is disabled for Groovy. ， Remediation :  ， Users should upgrade to 1.3.8 or 1.4.3. Users that do not want to upgrade can address the vulnerabilities by setting script.groovy.sandbox.enabled to false in elasticseach.yml and restarting the node.",
