The Privoxy user will then be prompted for a username and ， password that appears to originate from the Privoxy software. ， Scenario :  ， 1 ) A Privoxy user visits a website using a browser of their choice ， 2 ) The remote website responds to the request with a 407 \"Proxy ， Authentication Required\" HTTP response code and the appropriate ， \"Proxy-Authenticate : Basic\" HTTP response header ， 3 ) This response is passed through the Privoxy service without ， modification to the users browser ， 4 ) As the browser is configured to use a proxy server , the browser ， believes that the upstream proxy ( Privoxy ) has requested ， authentication and prompts the user for a username and password. This ， prompt states that the proxy server at \"127.0.0.1 : 8118\" requires ， authentication ( this prompt may vary if Privoxy is running on a ， machine other than localhost and/or on a non-default port number )  ， 5 ) If the user enters a username and password , the browser will send ， a request through Privoxy to the remote website with a ， \"Proxy-Authorization : XX\" HTTP request header ( where XX is ， a base64 encoded version of the username and password the user ， entered at the browsers proxy authentication prompt )  ， 6 ) The remote website receives this header and can store or re-use ， these captured credentials",
