This release will have enhanced XSS defenses ， addressing two recently discovered vulnerabilities. Since release of the ， code will potentially expose the vulnerabilities , I plan to publish a ， patch against the 2.1.13 base with the fix before actually releasing the ， 2.1.14 candidate. ， I will post the patch to the same 4 lists that this post is being sent ， to in the early afternoon , GMT , on September 9. ， The vulnerabilities are obscure and can only be exploited by a list ， owner , but if you are concerned about them you can plan to install the ， patch. ， The patch is small ( 34 line diff )  , only affects two modules and doesn't ， require a Mailman restart to be effective , although I would recommend a ， restart as soon as convenient after applying the patch. ， Mark Sapiro <mark at msapiro.net> The highway is for gamblers ,  ， San Francisco Bay Area , California better use your sense - B.
