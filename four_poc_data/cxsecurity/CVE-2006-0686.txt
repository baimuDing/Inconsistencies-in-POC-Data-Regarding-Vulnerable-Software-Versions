RoMaNSoFt ) <roman ( at ) rs-labs ( dot ) com [ email concealed ] > ， URL :  ， . :  [ SUMMARY ]  ， With about 100.000 installs , VHCS ( Virtual Hosting Control System )  [ 1 ] is ， perhaps the best known professional control panel software being open source ， and an excelent choice for shared , reseller , virtual and dedicated server ， management. ， VHCS team recently released a security patch ( dated on Feb , 5th ) . As I was ， evaluating that software ( mainly from a functional perspective ) and I care ， about security I decided to download it and have a look at it. Soon I realized ， that the patch was flawed : it was indeed adding a big XSS [ 5 ] security hole ( by ， removing specific XSS protection which existed in latest VHCS version - ， 2.4.7.1 ) . I reported the problem to Alexander Kotov ( VHCS project leader ,  ， hereinafter will be referred as \"the vendor\" )  , with cc to Full-Disclosure ， mailing-list [ 2 ] . This is bug # 1 and we will mark the related security patch ， as \"v.1\". As a bonus , I also reported another bug :  # 2. ， The vendor issued a new security patch ( a.k.a. \"v.2\" )  , correcting the XSS ， problems , and refused to explain what the real bug supposedly being fixed was ,  ， either publicly neither privately. Moreover , they didn't inform its own users ， of the problems with security patch v.1 and indeed they simply replaced the ， old patch ( v.1 ) with the new one ( v.2 )  , without changing filename nor issuing ， any kind of warning. I'm differentiating them here by adding the \"v. # \" suffix. ， I quickly researched the new patch. It only introduced one line of code into ， check_login (  ) function. I found a critical bug being partially fixed here. ， Let's name it as bug # 3. I also noticed the same function continued being ， buggy ( before or after applying patch v.2 ) and while testing former bugs I ， discovered a new bug (  # 4 ) . Finally vendor issued a third patch ( dated on Feb ,  ， 9th )  , let's call it v.3. It corrected bug # 3 but not # 4 ( which is 0day at the ， time of writing this advisory ) . ， . :  [ BUG # 1 ]  ， Severity : High ， Affected : 2.4.7.1 + patch v.1 , 2.4.6.2 ( and lower )  ， Fixed : 2.4.7.1 ( optionally plus : patch v.2 or patch v.3 )  ， Summary : \"Admin Log\" XSS ， VHCS has three different access level interfaces : administrator , reseller ， and domain user. The administrator interface is the more powerful and permits ， full control over the system. One of the tasks of a VHCS administrator is ， reviewing logs and this functionality is integrated on the admin interface. ， You can reach it by logging with an admin account and then clicking : System ， Tools -> Admin log. This dynamic page ( and the rest of the GUI ) is written in ， PHP. Basically , what it will do is to read logs from MySQL database ( in parti- ， cular , table \"log\" from \"vhcs2\" database , by default )  , perform some kind of ， simple parsing ( for instance , adding bold style to certain special words ) and",
