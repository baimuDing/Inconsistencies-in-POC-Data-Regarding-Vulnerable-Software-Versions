    "text": "vul_name : GDM TOCTTOU race condition on /tmp/.X11-unix ， vul_cve : CVE-2013-4169 ， vul_poc : As per the distros @ list recommendations , I'm writing to alert of a ， problem with older versions of GDM. As per our bugzilla [ 1 ]  :  ， Vladz reported that GDM versions < 2.21.1 were vulnerable to a TOCTTOU ，  ( time of check to time of use ) flaw in the way that GDM checked for the ， existence of , and created if missing , the /tmp/.X11-unix/ special ， directory. A local attacker could use this flaw to overwrite arbitrary ， file contents via symbolic link attacks or to manipulate the contents of ， arbitrary files , including those files owned by the root user that would ， normally be inaccessible. This is because GDM will chown /tmp/.X11-unix ， to the user and group root , but also changes the permissions to 1777. ， Newer versions of GDM no longer create the /tmp/.X11-unix/ directory and ， are thus not vulnerable to this flaw. ， This issue was assigned CVE-2013-4169. We fixed the problem by having ， rc.sysinit pre-create /tmp/.X11-unix at boot , like it does for ， /tmp/.ICE-unix ( and removing the offending code from GDM ) . ，  [ 1 ] ",
