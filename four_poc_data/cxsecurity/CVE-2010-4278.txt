    "text": "vul_name : Pandora FMS <= 3.1 OS Command Injection ， vul_cve : CVE-2010-4278 ， vul_poc :  [ + ] Introduction ， Pandora FMS ( for Pandora Flexible Monitoring System ) is a software ， solution for monitoring computer networks. It allows monitoring in a ， visual way the status and performance of several parameters from ， different operating systems , servers , applications and hardware systems ， such as firewalls , proxies , databases , web servers or routers. ， It can be deployed in almost any operating system. It features remote ， monitoring ( WMI , SNMP , TCP. UDP , ICMP , HTTP. ) and it can also use ， agents. An agent is available for each platform. It can also monitor ， hardware systems with a TCP/IP stack , such as load balancers , routers ,  ， network switches , printers or firewalls. ， This software has several servers that process and get information from ， different sources , using WMI for gathering remote Windows information , a ， predictive server , a plug-in server which makes complex user-defined ， network tests , an advanced export server to replicate data between ， different sites of Pandora FMS , a network discovery server , and an SNMP ， Trap console. ， Released under the terms of the GNU General Public License , Pandora FMS ， is free software. ， 2 ) OS Command Injection - CVE-2010-4278 - CVSS 9/10 ， The layout parameter in file operation/agentes/networkmap.php is not ， properly filtered and allows an attacker to inject OS commands. ， Snippet of vulnerable code ( file operation/agentes/networkmap.php )  :  ， 32 $ layout = ( string ) get_parameter ( 'layout' , 'radial' )  ;  ， . ， 137 $ filename_map = $ config [ \"attachment_store\" ] .\"/networkmap_\". $ layout ;  ， 138 $ filename_img = \"attachment/networkmap_\". $ layout.\"_\". $ font_size ;  ， 139 $ filename_dot = $ config [ \"attachment_store\" ] .\"/networkmap_\". $ layout ;  ， . ， 162 $ cmd = \" $ filter -Tcmapx -o\". $ filename_map.\" -Tpng ， - -o\". $ filename_img.\" \". $ filename_dot ;  ， 163 $ result = system (  $ cmd )  ;  ， PoC :  ， If we use vulnerability # 1 ( that permits bypass the authentication ， system and login as admin ) with this issue , the CVSS will be 10/10. ，  [ + ] Impact ， An attacker can execute commands of the operating system , inject remote ， code in the context of the application , get arbitrary files from the ， filesystem or extract any data of the database including passwords and ， confidential information about the monitored network/systems. Also it is ， possible to bypass the authentication or scale privileges to became ， admin , gaining full control of the web application and web server. These ， vulnerabilities have a high impact to the confidentiality , integrity ,  ， and availability of the system. ，  [ + ] Systems affected ， Versions prior and including 3.1 of Pandora FMS are affected ，  [ + ] Solution ， Apply the security fix for version 3.1 :  ， Or upgrade to version 3.1.1 from ，  [ + ] Timeline ， Ago 2010 : First contact to vendor ， Ago 2010 : Confirmation of vendor ， Sept 2010 : Second contact : SQL Injection vulnerabilities ， Sept 2010 : Confirmation that the fix will be released on October ， Oct 2010 : PandoraFMS security patch for 3.1 version released ， Oct 2010 : Request for CVE numbers ， Nov 2010 : PandoraFMS version 3.1.1 released ， Nov 2010 : Disclosure of this advisory ，  [ + ]  ， Official PandoraFMS site :  ， SourceForge PandoraFMS site :  ， Wikipedia entry about PandoraFMS :  ， Common Vulnerability Scoring System ( CVSS ) v2 calculator :  ， Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures ( CVE )  :  ，  [ + ] Credits ， These vulnerabilities has been discovered by Juan Galiana Lara - ，  @ jgaliana -",
