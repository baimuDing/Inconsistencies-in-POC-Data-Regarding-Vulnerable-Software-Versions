However , since PHP uses type-unstrict comparisons and ，  $ lastEntryId isn't guaranteed to be an integer , this allows an ， attacker to prefix their string of choice with any number of integers ，  ( so that $ lastEntryId gets treated as an integer during the ， comparison ) such that the comparison evaluates to true and ，  $ criteria->condition is injected with the otherwise unsanitized ，  $ lastEntryId , which can be any SQL injection.",
