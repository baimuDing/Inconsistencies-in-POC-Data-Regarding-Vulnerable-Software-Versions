A remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability using a specially-crafted URL to execute script in a victim?s web browser within the security context of the Adaptive Security Appliance site. ， Affected Products ， Cisco ASA version 8.1 ( 1 ) and earlier. ， Vendor Information , Solutions and Workarounds ， Cisco has released a fix to address this security flaw. Upgrade to ASA software version 8.1 ( 2 ) to remediate this issue. ， Release Notes are available at :  ， 2.html ， The following ?Resolved Caveat? is listed in the Release Notes :  ， CSCsr09163 webvpn - +webvpn+/index.html http response splitting problem. ， Details ， When a user connects to the web interface of the ASA via HTTP , they are automatically redirected to the SSL encrypted version. The web server issues a 301 Moved Permanently status code to the connecting client to facilitate this redirection. If the client appends the carriage return ( %0d ) and line feed ( %0a ) characters to the URL , the web server will parse these and allow the client to inject arbitrary HTTP response headers. Using this method , it is possible to inject a second Location header to the client. The client web browser will act on only the last Location header it encounters and redirect there. ， SecureWorks Risk Scoring ， Likelihood ( scale of 1-5 , with 5 being high )  : 5 ? This device is designed to be on the perimeter of a network to allow remote access. ， Impact ( scale of 1-5 , with 5 being high )  : 4 ? Leveraging this attack could lead to stolen credentials and access to the VPN. ， CVSS Severity ( version 2.0 )  ， Access Vector : Network exploitable ， Access Complexity : Low ， Authentication : Not required to exploit ， Confidentiality Impact : None ， Integrity Impact : Partial ， Availability Impact : None ， Impact Subscore : 2.9 ， Exploitability Subscore : 10 ， CVSS v2 Base Score : 5 ( Medium )  ( AV : N/AC : L/Au : N/C : N/I : P/A : N )  ， Proof of Concept ， URL :  ， Request :  ， GET HTTP/1.0 ， Host : x.x.x.x",
