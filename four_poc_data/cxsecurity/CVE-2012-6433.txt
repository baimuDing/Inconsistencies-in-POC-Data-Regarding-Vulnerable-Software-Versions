This is possible since e-tokens or any other request ， validation is not used during this type of request. The severity of this vulnerability ， increases when the Administrator has the ability to post News Items containing javascript. ， This results in an attacker having the ability to force an administrator to post any arbitrary ， javascript to the front page of the e107 site. Also , once posted , the resulting page :  ， /e107/e107_admin/newspost.php displays the new content to the Administrator , and if this ， javascript is set in the news_title POST parameter , it is executed on this page in the ， context of the Administrator. This results in the ability for an attacker to use any type ， of javascript attack at this point in time on the Administrator through the backend news ， items , and/or on the front end to any logged in user that may visit this page. What ， naturally comes to mind is session hijacking through established User/Administrator cookies. ， Exploit : ",
