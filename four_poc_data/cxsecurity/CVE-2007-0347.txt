Only users with check-in permissions and Wiki or ticket edit ， permissions can perform an attack. But as the anonymous user usually ， is granted Wiki edit and ticket creation permissions , an attacker ， remotely and anonymously can cause a partial DoS ( depending on the pages ， requested ) on a CVSTrac installation by opening a new ticket or editing ， a Wiki page with an arbitrary text containing for instance the string ， \"/foo/bar'quux\". ， The result of an attack is an error of the underlying SQLite RDBMS :  ，  | Database Error ，  | db_exists : Database exists query failed ，  | SELECT filename FROM filechng WHERE filename='foo/bar'quux' ，  | Reason : near \"quux\" : syntax error ， ANALYSIS ， The DoS vulnerability exists because the is_eow (  ) function in \"format.c\" ， does NOT just check the first (  !  ) character of the supplied string ， string and this way can skip a single embedded quotation mark. The ， is_repository_file (  ) function then in turn assumes that the filename ， string can never contain a single quotation mark and traps into an SQL ， escaping problem. ， An SQL injection via this technique is somewhat limited as is_eow (  )  ， bails on whitespace. So while one _can_ do an SQL injection , one is ， limited to SQL queries containing only characters which get past the ， like \"VACUUM\". ， WORKAROUND ， Administrators can quickly workaround by revoking permissions on the",
