    "text": "vul_name : Windows XP/NT/SMB2003/2000 Denial of Service attack ， vul_cve : CVE-2006-3880 ， vul_poc : -BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE- ， Hash : SHA1 ， According to Microsoft the following tool does nothing to Windows ， based machines. According to my experience it does. According to ， the experience of 5 separate administrators it does as well. You be ， the judge of this. Initially this is/was a tool called bubonic.c ， which was modified for some IDS testing on a Cisco ASA5520 so the ， tool is a sort of re-post of sorts. Some of the flags were modified ， and more ranDUMBness introduced. ， The attack was done locally and remotely. Locally this is/was my ， setup @ home :  ， Workstations :  ， Windows XP Professional Pentium Centrino Laptop ， FreeBSD 6.1 Pentium M Laptop ， Solaris 10 / Sunfire 280r ， Networking :  ， Cisco 2624 ， Cisco 3640 ， Cisco 2970 ， 3Com Superstack ， Motorola Surfboard @ 10mb down 3mb up ， compiled :  ， gcc -o achilles achilles.c ，  ( LOCAL ATTACK )  ， ./achilles 10.10.10.4 205.205.205.255 1 1 ， Remotely it was sent with the same settings and the results were ， the same. The targets were two boxes , one on a T3 and the other set ， up for me on a DS3 connection in which I sent the attack from my ， home to both machines and the results were the same as well. I had ， to change the address for the attack though and spoof it from one ， of my websites to avoid RFC1918 filtering. ， Keep in mind the random (  ) calls which I know offhand will change. ， Try it once , try it twice. I've gotten it to work for me every ， given time , two testers stated they'd gotten even odder results. ， Anyhow , since MS stated they found nothing they won't mind their ， write up being quoted on this. ，  * Achilles.c version2 ，  * Remodified Achilles Windows Attack Tool ，  * compiled on FreeBSD 6.1 , SuSE 10 ，  * Solaris 10 , NetBSD 3.0 ,  ，  * Proof of Concept tool that disconnects ，  * Windows machines until the program is ，  * stopped.
