All versions before 2.0.17 are affected. ， DETAILS ， The documentation of uWSGI states that the php-docroot option is used to jail our php environment to a project directory (  ，  ; jail our php environment to project_dir ， php-docroot = % ( project_dir )  ， During testing it was observed that uWSGI was affected by a Directory Traversal vulnerability when executed as a standalone ( without a front-end web server ) along with the \"php-docroot\" option to enforce the DOCUMENT_ROOT of the web application. ， uwsgi -http-socket : 1337 -protocol=http -plugin php -php-index index.php -php-docroot /home/testing/webapp/ ， An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by using path traversal sequences ( \".%2f\" ) to access sensitive information as demonstrated below :  ， We noticed that when a Directory Traversal attack was performed , uWSGI was issuing the following security error :  ，  [ uwsgi-fileserve ] security error : /etc/passwd is not under /home/testing/webapp or a safe path ， However , the contents of the requested file ( i.e. , /etc/passwd ) were still returned to the user. ， After searching the web for possible solutions , we noticed that the \"php-allowed-docroot\" option was previously added to uWSGI for better security and could be used to list the allowed document roots but no further details were available (  ， Upon further testing , we observed that when the \"php-allowed-docroot\" was used instead of the \"php-docroot\" option , it was not affected by Directory Traversal attacks. ， uwsgi -http-socket : 1337 -protocol=http -plugin php -php-index index.php -php-allowed-docroot /home/testing/webapp/ ， After a very constructive and helpful talk with the uWSGI Project , they released an update which enforces a DOCUMENT_ROOT check when using the \"php-docroot\" option to prevent Directory Traversal attacks. Please see the MITIGATION section for more information. ， IMPACT ， An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to gain unauthorized read access to sensitive files located outside of the web root directory. ， MITIGATION ， It is recommended to update to uWSGI 2.0.17 - ， REFERENCES ， TIMELINE ， 26 June 2017 - uWSGI Project informed about the issue ， 26 February 2018 - uWSGI Project released a patch ， 1 March 2018 - Exploit publicly disclosed",
