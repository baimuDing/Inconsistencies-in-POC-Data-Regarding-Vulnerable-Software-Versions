Successful exploitation of this bug results in vertical privilege escalation. ， Technical Details :  ， The function handling IOCTL 0x830020C4 does not validate the size of the output buffer parameter passed in the DeviceIoControl API , which leads to a heap overflow on buffer data initialization. In particular , the function assumes that the output buffer has a size of 0x22C4 bytes. By declaring a smaller buffer we are able to overwrite other data and kernel objects that might follow and potentially control the execution flow via a corrupted kernel object. ， ba31cb06 8b7d14 mov edi , dword ptr [ ebp+14h ] <- EDI = allocated buffer ， ba31cb09 ff7514 push dword ptr [ ebp+14h ]  ， ba31cb0c b9b1080000 mov ecx , 8B1h <- assume buffer size 0x8b1 * 4 ， ba31cb11 33c0 xor eax , eax <- zero out EAX ， ba31cb13 f3ab rep stos dword ptr es :  [ edi ] <- Heap Overflow ， Further details at :  ， Copyright :  ， Copyright ( c ) Portcullis Computer Security Limited 2014 , All rights reserved worldwide.
