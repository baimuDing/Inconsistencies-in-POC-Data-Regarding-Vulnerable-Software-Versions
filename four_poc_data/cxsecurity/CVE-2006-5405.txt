The vulnerable ， Bluetooth wireless device drivers are subject to potential attacks ， through specially crafted Bluetooth packets. An attacker can ， potentially take advantage of these conditions to cause a memory ， corruption , a system crash , and/or the execution of arbitrary code at ， the highest privilege level. An attacker would need to be within ， approximately 10 meters of the victim. Additionally , an attacker would ， need the Bluetooth address of the victim's device. Bluetooth addresses ， are easily enumerated through active scanning if the device allows ， discovery. ， Detection :  ， Users of Toshiba's Bluetooth stack are encouraged to check the current ， Bluetooth stack version by selecting :  ， Version 3.x - \"Device Properties.\" , then \"General\" ， Version 4.x - \"Options\" , then \"General\" , then \"Details\" ， Toshiba has advised that security patches are normally offered for all ， Bluetooth stacks. Please consult the download details document for ， further information. ， Users of Dell Bluetooth products are encouraged to verify the presence ， and version of their Bluetooth stack by double-clicking on the ， Bluetooth icon in the system tray to open the Bluetooth client utility ， and selecting \"Help\" , then \"About\". ， Recommendations :  ， Toshiba has recommended that affected users visit their Bluetooth ， vendor's website for an updated Bluetooth stack. If a patch is ， unavailable , please visit the Toshiba Bluetooth website , which offers ， security updates for all Bluetooth stacks including OEM versions , as ， well as a Bluetooth Stack Security Pack at :  ， Users of Dell Latitude D820/D620/D420/D520 are asked to verify the ， version of their Bluetooth stack using the method described above. If ， your version is not 4.00.22 ( D ) SP2 or newer , then it is recommended that ， users upgrade to the latest driver versions located at ， Users of Dell Latitude D810/D610/D410/D510/X1 are asked to verify the ， version of their Bluetooth stack using the method described above. If ， your version is not 4.00.20 ( D ) SP2 or newer , then it is recommended ， that users upgrade to the latest driver versions to be made available ， by November 4th , 2006 at ， Bluetooth device users should be set to non-discoverable mode during ， normal operations to reduce risk from this and other potential future ， Bluetooth attacks. ， SecureWorks Research Client Advisory ， Multiple Vendor Bluetooth Stack Memory Corruption Vulnerability ， Toshiba : Bluetooth Download Page ， Dell Support ， Buffer Overrun in Toshiba Bluetooth Stack for Windows ， CVSS Scoring :  ， Access Vector : Remote ， Access Complexity : High ， Authentication : Not Required ， Confidentiality : Complete ， Integrity : Complete ， Availability : Complete ， Impact Bias : Normal ， Score : 8.0",
