    "text": "vul_name : Hobbit monitor : Security issue with Hobbit 4.2-beta client ， vul_cve : CVE-2006-3373 ， vul_poc : I was just notified by a Hobbit user that the current beta client has ， a security problem in the client \"logfetch\" utility , when installed as ， suid-root ( which is the default if \"make install\" is executed as root ) . ， Impact ， The effect of this is that any user who is able to login and create ， files on a system with the Hobbit client installed , can use the \"logfetch\" ， utility to get read access to any file on the system. ， Which versions are affected ， This issue affects all of the pre-release ( alfa- , beta- and snapshot-versions )  ， of the Hobbit client version 4.2 released until today ( 2006-Jun-30 )  , when the ， client was installed as root and ~ hobbit/client/bin/logfetch is suid-root. ， The 4.1.x releases of the Hobbit client does not include the \"logfetch\" ， utility , and are therefore NOT affected by this. ， Remedy ， It is recommended that you remove the suid bit from the logfetch utility ， on systems where you have installed the Hobbit 4.2-beta client package. ， To do this :  ， chmod 755 ~ hobbit/client/bin/logfetch ， Note that this may cause logfile monitoring to break , if the client does ， not have read access to the monitored logfiles. ， Running logfetch as suid-root will most likely be removed in the final ， Hobbit 4.2 release of the client. ， Regards ,  ， Henrik Storner , the Hobbit developer",
