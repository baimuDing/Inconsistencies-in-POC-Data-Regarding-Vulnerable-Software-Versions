Unauthenticated attackers on the same LAN can use this vulnerability to :  ， - Access arbitrary files from the filesystem with the same permission as the user account running Vuze. ， - Initiate SMB connections to capture NetNTLM challenge/response and crack to clear-text password. ， - Initiate SMB connections to relay NetNTLM challenge/response and achieve Remote Command Execution in Windows domains. ， Exploitation can be demonstrated using evil-ssdp (  ，  # Discovered By ， Chris Moberly @ The Missing Link Security ，  # Vendor Status ， Multiple attempts to contact Vuze team resulted in no replies. ，  # Vulnerability Details ， Attack type : Remote , unauthenticated ， Impact : Information disclosure up to code execution ， Affected component : Vuze Bittorrent Client's SSDP discovery / XML parsing ， Operating Systems affected : Verified Windows 10 ( likely all versions )  ， Vuze version affected : Tested on 5.7.6.0 ( current as of July 2018 ) . Older versions likely also vulnerable. ， Attack vector : XE ，  # Technical Overview ， Vuze , like many other media servers , will attempt to discover other devices on a local network. The discovery process is handled by Simple Service Discovery Protocol ( SSDP )  , which sends a UDP multicast out to 239.255.255.250 on port 1900. This is the first step in finding and adding Universal Plug and Play ( UPNP ) devices. ， We can reply to that UDP multicast directly on the same port that the request initiated from , informing this client that we have a shared device. When we do this , we provide the location of an XML file containing more information about our device. This is called a Device Descriptor. ， Vuze will automatically access the Device Descriptor over HTTP , parsing the XML content. This is expected behaviour for SSDP/UPNP. ， By hosting a specially crafted XML file at that location , we can force Vuze to do several things. The POC used to prove this vulnerability ( POC 1 below ) contained the following XML content :  ， ` ， <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"ISO-8859-1\"?>",
