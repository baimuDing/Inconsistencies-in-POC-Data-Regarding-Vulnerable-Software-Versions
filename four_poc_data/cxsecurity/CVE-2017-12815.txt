    "text": "vul_name : Bomgar Remote Support Portal ( RSP ) Path Traversal ， vul_cve : CVE-2017-12815 ， vul_poc : Hey ,  ， The Path Traversal vulnerability was found in the component of the Bomgar ， Remote Support Portal ( RSP )  [ 1 ] . The affected component is a JavaStart.jar ， applet that is hosted at on the ， vulnerable RSP deployments. The JavaStart version 52970 and prior were ， confirmed to be vulnerable. ， Analysis of the applet revealed that App.class suffers from a Path ， Traversal vulnerability. The vulnerable class makes a call to a File (  )  ， constructor and uses the value specified in the \"url\" parameter as an ， argument. The \"url\" parameter is specified in the <PARAM NAME> HTML tag ， which passes arguments to applets embedded on web sites using an <APPLET> ， HTML tag , in this case JavaStart.jar applet. ， Successful exploitation results in the creation/modification/deletion of ， files with the privilege of the user who runs the Java applet. In order to ， exploit this vulnerability a victim would have to visit the attacker's ， controlled website and allow the Java applet to execute. ， It may be argued that the Path Traversal is not an issue in this case ， because the victim has to download and run unknown code. While this is ， usually correct , one needs to consider that anyone can embed the ， JavaStart.jar applet on their website , while the applet can be hosted on a ， legitimate/trustworthy location ( i.e. for successful exploitation attacker ， needs to control the <PARAM NAME> , not the contents of the archive or the ， domain it is hosted at ) . Additonaly , the applet will be digitally signed ， by a trustworthy organisation. Last but not least , the purpose of the ， applet itself makes it easy to convince/trick users. ， The final impact of the vulnerability heavily depends on additional ， factors , such as operating system , web browser and its settings , Java ， settings , user privileges running the applet etc. The vulnerability was ， successfully executed on Windows 7 running IE 11 with its default ， configuration. On Mac OS Sierra running Safari 10.1 , the Java restrictions ， prevented traversing outside of the temp/sandbox directory. ， The PoC exploiting this vulnerability is included below :  ，  $ cat > page.html EOF",
