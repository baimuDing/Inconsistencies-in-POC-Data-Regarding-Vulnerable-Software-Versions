Close button available to users despite workflow restrictions ， This issue affects Mantis 1.2.12 and later. ， It allows low-privileged users to close issues even though the workflow ， settings do not permit it. ， 2. XSS vulnerability when deleting a version ， This issue affects Mantis 1.2.14 only. ， Arbitrary JavaScript could be executed in the client's browser when deleting ， a version containing embedded code in its name. The criticality of this ， issue is compounded by the fact that a high-privilege account ( typically ， project manager or administrator ) is required to both to create and delete a ， version. ， 3. XSS vulnerability on Configuration Report page ， This issue affects Mantis 1.2.13 only [ 1 ] . ， If the system defines a Project containing embedded JavaScript code in its ， name , that code would be executed in the client's browser when displaying ， the configuration report page ( adm_config_report.php ) . ， The severity of this issue is mitigated by the need to have a ， high-privileged account both to set the project's name and to access the ， configuration report page. ， 4. XSS issue on Configuration Report page when displaying complex value ， This issue affects Mantis 1.2.0rc1 and later. ， Lack of proper string escaping allows users ( having admin access ) to enter ， arbitrary javascript code and have it executed on the user's browser. ， Issues resolution :  ， - 1 & 2 will be fixed in upcoming release 1.2.15 , expected to go live ， sometime next week ( patches are available in the referenced issues )  ， - 3 & 4 were both resolved in version 1.2.14 , released on 29-Jan-2013 ， Could you kindly assign CVEs for the above issues ? Thanks in advance. ， Best regards ,  ， D. Regad ， MantisBT Developer ，  [ 1 ] MantisBT version 1.2.13 was tagged in the repository but never formally ， released , as we discovered several critical issues at the last minute and ， decided to pull it and released 1.2.14 a week later instead.",
