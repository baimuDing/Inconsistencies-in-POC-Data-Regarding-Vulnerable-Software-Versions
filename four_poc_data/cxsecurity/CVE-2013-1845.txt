There are no known instances of this ， problem being observed in the wild. ， Known vulnerable :  ， Subversion HTTPD servers <= 1.6.20 ， Subversion HTTPD servers 1.7.0 through 1.7.8 ( inclusive )  ， Known fixed :  ， Subversion 1.6.21 ， Subversion 1.7.9 ， svnserve ( any version ) is not vulnerable ， Details :  ， Setting or deleting a large number of properties on a node ( file or ， directory ) will result in a large amount of memory use. Due to the ， memory pooling behavior of Apache httpd and Subversion the completion of ， the request will not result in the immediate release of memory used. ， Repeated commits with the same properties will result in each httpd process ， plateauing out at some amount of memory. This could result in a Denial of ， Service if the system is exhausted of all available memory. ， Severity :  ， CVSSv2 Base Score : 4.9 ， CVSSv2 Base Vector : AV : N/AC : H/Au : S/C : N/I : N/A : C ， We consider this to be a medium risk vulnerability.
