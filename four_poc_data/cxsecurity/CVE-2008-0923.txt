Virtualization technologies such as VMware's increase ， efficiency in the use of hardware and help to reduce operational costs ， through consolidation of servers and desktop system running on fewer and ， more maintainable hardware systems. ， Among the many reasons that promote the adoption virtualization ， technologies , one of the most commons today is the promise of an improved ， information security posture due to the implied isolation between multiple ， virtualized systems ( referred as Guest systems ) and the non-virtualized ， systems controlling the virtualization hardware and software ( the Host ， system )  [ 1 ] . ， Consequently , software bugs that could allow potential attackers to ， invalidate the premise of effective isolation between Host and Guest ， systems are considered security vulnerabilities with a potentially high ， impact. Attacks to exploit these type of vulnerabilities has been ， discussed on several public forums [ 2 ]  [ 3 ] . To maintain and improve user ， inter-operation with virtualized and non-virtualized systems VMware's ， software implements a number of inter-system communication features. The ， Shared Folder mechanism is one of such features and is enabled by default ， in all VMware's products that provide it. ， VMware's shared folders allow users to transfer data between a virtualized ， system ( Guest ) and the non-virtualized Host system that contains it. This ， form of data transfer is available to users of the Guest system through ， read and write access to file system folders shared by both Guest and Host ， system. To maintain effective isolation between Guest and Host systems ,  ， these mechanisms should limit access from the Guest only to the Host ， system's folders that are selected for sharing with the virtualized guests. ， A vulnerability was found in VMware's shared folders mechanism that grants ， users of a Guest system read and write access to any portion of the Host's ， file system including the system folder and other security-sensitive ， files. Exploitation of these vulnerability allows attackers to break out ， of an isolated Guest system to compromise the underlying Host system that ， controls it. ， Successful exploitation requires that the Shared Folder's feature to be ， enabled which is the default on VMware products that have the feature AND ， at least one folder of the Host system is configured for sharing. ，  * Vulnerable Packages *  ， . VMWare Workstation 6.0.2 ， . VMWare Workstation 5.5.4 ， . VMWare Player 2.0.2 ， . VMWare Player 1.0.4 ， . VMWare ACE 2.0.2 ， . VMWare ACE 1.0.2 ，  * Non-vulnerable Packages *  ， . VMWare ESX ， . VMWare Server ，  * Vendor Information , Solutions and Workarounds *  ， Disable the Shared Folders feature for all virtual machines. On VMWare ， Workstation this can be done by clicking on \"Edit virtual machine ， settings\" and disabling shared folders in the Options tab. ， The vendor has published a security alert with a setp-by-step description ， of how to disable Shared Folders on affected products. ，  * Critical VMware Security Alert for Windows-Hosted VMware Workstation ,  ， VMware Player , and VMware ACE *  ， =displayKC&externalId=1004034 ，  * Credits *  ， This vulnerability was discovered by Gerardo Richarte while developing an ， exploit for vulnerability CVE-2007-1744. The final exploit for both ， vulnerabilities was developed by Nicolas Economou , both of them from CORE ， IMPACT's Exploit Writing Team ( EWT )  , Core Security Technologies.",
