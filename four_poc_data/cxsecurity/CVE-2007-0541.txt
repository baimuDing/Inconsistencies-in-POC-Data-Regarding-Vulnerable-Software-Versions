Note that some issues ， discovered with Pingback affect other vendors as well. Please see ， the following advisory for details : 4tphi-sa-20070111-pingback ， Details :  ， WordPress is vulnerable to the attacks described in the pingback ， advisory. In testing , a single PC on a T1 connection was able to cripple ， two dual Xeon apache servers on separate 100Mb connection. This was ， accomplished by sending out multiple requests to server A specifying a ， sourceURI on server B that was a 1GB media file. This attack utilizes ， resources on server A and server B , but not the malicious users machine. ， Additionally , WordPress does not sanitize the sourceURI before passing ， it to wp_remote_fopen (  )  ; This makes it possible to specify non-HTTP ， resources to be read such as local files or ftp sources. In particular , a ， malicious user can determine whether certain files exist on the local file ， system. For example , the following request would help determine the ， version of Linux being used :  ， <methodCall> ， <methodName>pingback.ping</methodName> ， <params> ， <param> ， <value><string>/etc/SuSE-release</string></value> ， </param> ， <param> ， <value><string> ， </param> ， </params> ， </methodCall> ， If this file does not exist , fault 16 ( source URI does not exist ) will be ， returned and if it does exist it is likely that fault 17 ( source URI does ， not contain a link to the target URI ) will be returned. This works ， whether curl or the fopen (  ) stream is used , only the uri has to be ， changed. This will not work if the webserver user can not read the file. ， If the administrator has allowed automatic pingbacks to show up as ， comments , it is possible for an attacker to have system information ， display in that comment. For instance , an attacker could request a url on ， the host with the following text in it :  ， <title>example</title><a href=\"valid targetURI\">text</a> ， If that showed up in the apache access_log or error_log , and the ， webserver user had permission to read that file the above XMLRPC request ,  ， after determining the OS , could specify the log as the sourceURI. This ， would cause some of the log file to be displayed as a comment. The session ， file for PHP would be a good target. ， Recommendations :  ， Upgrade to Wordpress 2.1. The original recommendations made to the ， Wordpress security team can be found below. Please note that Wordpress ， still does not check the content type , however the timeout has been set to ， 10 seconds and as such the impact of binary files is minimized. ， The local file issues can be resolved by ensuring that the URI scheme ， is HTTP. This also disallows other resources , such as ftp , from being ， read. In order to prevent overly large files from being retrieved , a ， reasonable timeout for curl and fopen should be set. Also , if content is ， missing a compatible Content-Type ( such as text/xml ) it should not be read ， as it can not be parsed. The attached patch is one possible solution to ， the issues described above. There are some more significant design ， problems , particularly with respect to pingback authentication. These are ， described in the pingback advisory and are not addressed here , as there ， has been no formal specification modification yet.",
