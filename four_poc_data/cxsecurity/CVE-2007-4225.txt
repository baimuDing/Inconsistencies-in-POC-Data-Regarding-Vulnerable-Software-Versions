A browser is ， entrapped within the attacking web site while the user thinks that ， browser actually left the page. ， The very similar problem affects Apple Safari (3.0.3) but due to ， recent changes in Safari code (vide ， ) it's a lot harder to ， conduct a successful attack - URL address bat content changes so ， frequently so the attack is revealed to the user (variants of attack are ， currently under investigation). ， The second one is based on the http URI scheme which allows embedding ， user/password parameters into it, i.e. ， Such parameters can contain whitespaces, so the attack vector is quite ， obvious. ， Tested with Konqueror 3.5.7 on Linux 2.6 ， The snapshot from my dekstop: ， Robert Swiecki"
