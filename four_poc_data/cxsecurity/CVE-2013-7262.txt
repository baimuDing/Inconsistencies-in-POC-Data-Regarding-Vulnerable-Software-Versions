    "text": "vul_name : MapServer SQL Injections with postgis TIME filters ， vul_cve : CVE-2013-7262 ， vul_poc : As part of @ rouault 's WFS 2.0 work he discovered a SQL injection issue specific to WMS-Time and perhaps SOS services. It has to do with PostGIS and time validation. Based on Even's tests for WMS-Time the vulnerability is limited to unintended disclosure of data from the specific table , if specific conditions are met :  ， WMS-Time is configured ， PostGIS is used ， GetFeatureInfo output formats dump all attributes ( e.g. gmlitems all )  ， Basically you can muck with the where clause but can& # 8217 ; t execute secondary commands ( e.g. delete & # 8230 ;  ) . It may be possible to access unintended data through the map itself ( e.g. via a label item ) but that seems pretty hard. Again , SOS services have not been examined.",
