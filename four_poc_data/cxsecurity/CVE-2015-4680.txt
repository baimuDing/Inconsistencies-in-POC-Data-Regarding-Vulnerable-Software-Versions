The FreeRADIUS usage of ， OpenSSL , in CRL application , limits the checks to leaf certificates , therefore not detecting revocation of intermediate CA certificates. ， An unexpired client certificate , issued by an intermediate CA with a revoked certificate , is therefore accepted by FreeRADIUS. ， Specifically sets the X509_V_FLAG_CRL_CHECK flag for leaf certificate CRL checks , but does not use X509_V_FLAG_CRL_CHECK_ALL for CRL checks on the complete trust chain. ， The FreeRADIUS project advises that the recommended configuration is to use self-signed CAs for all EAP-TLS methods. ， Affected version :  ， FreeRADIUS <= 2.2.7 , <= 3.0.8 ， Fixed version :  ， FreeRADIUS >= 2.2.8 , >= 3.0.9 ， Credit : vulnerability anonymously reported. ， CVE : CVE-2015-4680",
