This vulnerability was inherited from the SQL-Ledger ， codebase. Due to the fact that SQL-Ledger has a built-in text editor ,  ， this issue could result in arbitrary code execution on the server. The ， SQL-Ledger and LedgerSMB teams have both released patches to these ， vulnerabilities. ， Software affected :  ， SQL-Ledger , all versions prior to 2.6.19. ， LedgerSMB 1.0.0 ， Other SQL-Ledger derivatives should presume themselves vulnerable ( we ， have not checked ) . ， Patched versions :  ， SQL-Ledger 2.6.19 ， LedgerSMB 1.0.0p1 ， SQL-Ledger 2.4.4-2.4.17 are particularly vulnerable due to CVE-2006-4244. ， Mitigating factors :  ， Authentication is required ( only for LedgerSMB 1.0.0 and SQL-Ledger ， 2.4.3 and lower , or 2.6.18 ) . ， Detailed description :  ， The \"terminal\" query variable is insufficiently checked in the login.pl ， and admin.pl files for validity and can lead to directory transversal ， and arbitrary code execution in SQL-Ledger ( 2.6.18 and earlier ) and ， LedgerSMB ( 1.0.0 only ) . In particular , an attacker could upload a file ， called \"login.pl\" using these facilities. The attacher could then pass ， a specially malformed url to the web server that would cause it to ， execute the code. The form of the url might be :  ， In the course of our disclosure , we sent a notification to the developer ， of SQL-Ledger who quickly patched his software. ， All customers should upgrade to the newest versions of these packages at ， their earliest convenience. ， Credit for this disclosure should go to Chris Murtagh ( a private ， individual ) and Richard Patterson of Quickhelp. ， Best Wishes ,  ， Chris Travers ， Metatron Technology Consulting ， begin : vcard ， fn : Chris Travers ， n : Travers ; Chris ， email ; internet : chris ( at ) metatrontech ( dot ) com [ email concealed ]  ， tel ; work : 509-888-0220 ， tel ; cell : 509-630-7794 ， x-mozilla-html : FALSE ， version : 2.1 ， end : vcard",
