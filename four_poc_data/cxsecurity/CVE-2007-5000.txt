DESCRIPTION ， S-Mail& # 174 ; is an innovative email system that provides high-level protection for emails on the Internet. ， S-Mail users have safe and secure email correspondence. Only the sender and recipient of S-Mail can access emails sent through this service. ， S-Mail provides the ultimate protection with strong encryption for personal and business communications. ， S-Mail combines simplicity and security to create a tailored solution for protecting email. ， Messages and attached files are encrypted and decrypted through PGP , SSL and DSA algorithms on the user's PC. ， As a result , communications sent using S-Mail are delivered fully protected. ， S-Mail is compatible with all other email systems and programs. ， III. PROOF OF CONCEPT ， PHP version older than 4.4.1 ， Multiple vulnerabilities have been reported in PHP , which can be exploited by malicious people to conduct cross-site scripting attacks , bypass certain security restrictions , and potentially compromise a vulnerable system. ， Affected PHP versions ( up to 4.4.0 ) . ， The impact of this vulnerability ， _ ， Security bypass , cross site scripting , denial of service , system access. ， Apache version older than 1.3.28 ( Current version is : Apache/1.3.27 )  ， The impact of this vulnerability ， _ ， Multiple. Check references for details about every vulnerability. ， Apache version older than 1.3.41 ， Security fixes in Apache version 1.3.41 :  ， _ ， CVE-2007-6388 ( cve.mitre.org ) mod_status : Ensure refresh parameter is numeric to prevent a possible XSS attack caused by redirecting to other URLs. Reported by SecurityReason. [ Mark Cox ]  ， Security fixes in Apache version 1.3.40 :  ， _ ， CVE-2007-5000 ( cve.mitre.org ) mod_imap : Fix cross-site scripting issue. Reported by JPCERT. [ Joe Orton ]  ， CVE-2007-3847 ( cve.mitre.org ) mod_proxy : Prevent reading past the end of a buffer when parsing date-related headers. PR 41144. With Apache 1.3 , the denial of service vulnerability applies only to the Windows and NetWare platforms. [ Jeff ， Trawick ]  ， PHP HTML entity encoder heap overflow ， Stefan Esser reported some vulnerabilities in PHP , which can be exploited by malicious people to cause a DoS ( Denial of Service ) or potentially compromise a vulnerable system.The vulnerabilities are caused due to boundary errors within ， the \"htmlentities (  ) \" and \"htmlspecialchars (  ) \" functions. If a PHP application uses these functions to process user-supplied input , this can be exploited to cause a heap-based buffer overflow by passing specially crafted data to the ， affected application. Successful exploitation may allow execution of arbitrary code , but requires that the UTF-8 character set is selected. For a detailed explanation of the vulnerability read the referenced article. ， Vendor has released PHP 5.2.0 which fixes this issue. ， Affected PHP versions ( up to 4.4.4/5.1.6 ) . ， The impact of this vulnerability ， _ ， Denial of service , remote code execution. ， PHP unspecified remote arbitrary file upload vulnerability ， An unspecified remote arbitrary file upload vulnerability has been reported for this version of PHP. ， Affected PHP versions ( up to 4.3.8/5.0.1 ) . ， PHP Zend_Hash_Del_Key_Or_Index vulnerability ， Stefan Esser had discovered a weakness within the depths of the implementation of hashtables in the Zend Engine. ， This vulnerability affects a large number of PHP applications. It creates large new holes in many popular PHP applications. ， Additonally many old holes that were disclosed in the past were only fixed by using the unset (  ) statement. ， Many of these holes are still open if the already existing exploits are changed by adding the correct numerical keys to survive the unset (  ) . ， For a detailed explanation of the vulnerability read the referenced article. ， Affected PHP versions ( up to 4.4.2/5.1.3 ) . ， The impact of this vulnerability ， _ ， Code execution , SQL injection , . ， Unfiltered header injection in Apache 1.3.34/2.0.57/2.2.1 ， Vulnerability description ， This version of Apache is vulnerable to HTML injection ( including malicious Javascript code ) through \"Expect\" header. Until now it was not classified as a security vulnerability , since an attacker has no way to influence the Expect ， header to send the victim to a target website. However , according to Amit Klein's paper : \"Forging HTTP request headers with Flash\" there is a working cross site scripting ( XSS ) attack against Apache 1.3.34 , 2.0.57 and 2.2.1 ( as long as ， the client browser is IE or Firefox , and it supports Flash 6/7+ ) . ， The impact of this vulnerability ， _ ， Malicious users may inject JavaScript , VBScript , ActiveX , HTML or Flash to fool a user in order to gather data from them. An attacker can steal the session cookie and take over the account , impersonating the user. It is also possible to ， modify the content of the page presented to the user. ， How to fix this vulnerability ， _ ， Upgrade to the latest Apache versions. This flaw has been corrected in Apache versions ( 1.3.35/2.0.58/2.2.2 )  ， Apache error log escape sequence injection vulnerability ， This version of Apache is vulnerable to escape character sequences injection into error log.This problem may be exploited when a vulnerable terminal emulator is used. ， Affected Apache versions ( up to 2.0.48 for Apache 2.x and up to 1.3.29 for Apache 1.x ) . ， PHP mail function ASCII control character header spoofing vulnerability ， The PHP mail function does not properly sanitize user input. Because of this , a user may pass ASCII control characters to the mail (  ) function that could alter the headers of email. This could result in spoofed mail headers. ， Affected PHP versions ( up to 4.2.2 ) . ， PHP socket_iovec_alloc (  ) integer overflow ， Buffer overflow in openlog function for PHP 4.3.1 on Windows operating system , and possibly other OSes. ， Affected PHP versions ( up to 4.3.1 ) . ， The impact of this vulnerability ， _ ， Allow remote attackers to cause a crash and possibly execute arbitrary code via a long filename argument. ， How to fix this vulnerability ， _ ， Upgrade PHP to the latest version. ， Web references ， _ ， CVE 2003-0172 ， PHP4 multiple vulnerabilities ， PHP have released an upgrade to address multiple vulnerabilities , including integer overflow issues that have been reported to affect PHP4 and bundled software. ， IV.
