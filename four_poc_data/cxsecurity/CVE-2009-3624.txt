    "text": "vul_name : linux kernel 2.6.25.15 get_instantiation_keyring (  ) should inc the keyring ， vul_cve : CVE-2009-3624 ， vul_poc :  ， Quoting from the upstream commit :  ， \"The destination keyring specified to request_key (  ) and co. is made ， available to the process that instantiates the key ( the slave process ， started by /sbin/request-key typically ) . This is passed in the ， request_key_auth struct as the dest_keyring member. ， keyctl_instantiate_key and keyctl_negate_key (  ) call ， get_instantiation_keyring (  ) to get the keyring to attach the newly ， constructed key to at the end of instantiation. This may be given a ， specific keyring into which a link will be made later , or it may be ， asked to find the keyring passed to request_key (  ) . In the former case ,  ， it returns a keyring with the refcount incremented by lookup_user_key (  )  ;  ， in the latter case , it returns the keyring from the request_key_auth ， struct - and does _not_ increment the refcount. ， The latter case will eventually result in an oops when the keyring ， prematurely runs out of references and gets destroyed. The effect may ， take some time to show up as the key is destroyed lazily. ， To fix this , the keyring returned by get_instantiation_keyring (  ) must ， always have its refcount incremented , no matter where it comes from.\" ， This was introduced in upstream commit 8bbf4976 ( v2.6.29-rc1 ) .",
