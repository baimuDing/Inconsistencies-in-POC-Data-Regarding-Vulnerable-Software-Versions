It's possible to compromise a ， system behind a firewall by infiltrating the updates of Extension-Packs ， because of the following flaws :  ， 1. The Extension-Pack is updated via HTTP instead of HTTPS. The ， Extension-Packs are not signed , so a Man-In-The-Middle could send his ， own Extension-Pack ( with malicious code included ) instead of the regular ， update to the target. The Code would be executed with user-permissions. ， I reported this bug to Oracle but I think someone else discovered and ， reported it before. This bug also affects VirtualBox prior to 5.0.32 ,  ， prior to 5.1.14. I don't know the CVE. ， 2. CVE-2017-3316 : There is a privilege escalation bug in the downloader ， of VirtualBox. Extension-Packs are tar-archives. Tar-archives can ， preserve permissions. A Man-In-The-Middle could include an executable ， with setuid-permissions to the Extension-Pack. If the victim downloads ， the Ext-pack , it will be stored as owner root and without checking the ， permissions of the binaries. This bug affects VirtualBox prior to ， 5.0.32 , prior to 5.1.14 ， = [ Proof-Of-Concept ] = ， The executeable of the following code is placed in the ， Extension-Pack-Archive under linux.amd64/evil with setuid. ， / * evil.c ( executable with the reverse-shell )  * /",
