For further product information on the TippingPoint IPS :  ， - Vulnerability Details :  ， This vulnerability allows attackers to execute arbitrary code on ， vulnerable installations of America Online with Microsoft Internet ， Explorer. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in ， that the target must visit a malicious page. ， The specific flaw exists in the LinkSBIcons (  ) method exposed through ， the ActiveX control 'Sb.SuperBuddy.1' with the following CLSID :  ， 189504B8-50D1-4AA8-B4D6-95C8F58A6414 ， The affected control implements the IObjectSafety interface and ， therefore allows a web site to invoke the control under default ， Internet Explorer settings without any further user interaction. The ， vulnerable method is defined as :  ， int LinkSBIcons ( IUnknown * interface )  ， As the method accepts an unchecked user-controlled value specifying a ， pointer to an object , a subsequent function dereference is completely ， under attacker control. This can easily lead to arbitrary code ， execution under the context of the logged in user. ， It is important to note that many PCs ship with this vulnerable ， component by default , including Dell and Hewlett-Packard among others. ， Since AOL is addressing this issue as an update through their internet ， service , many users are left without any recourse for mitigation. ， Concerned users can specify a \"kill bit\" for the affected control to ， prevent it from loading within Internet Explorer. To do so , create the ， following registry key :  ， HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE SOFTWARE Microsoft Internet Explorer ActiveX Compatibility {189504B8-50D1-4AA8-B4D6-95C8F58A6414} ， With the value 'Compatibility Flags' set to 0x400.",
