A vulnerability exists in the Beehive Forum ， software that could allow a remote user to execute SQL injection ， attacks. These attacks could compromise sensitive data including ， usernames and passwords for the Beehive application. Arbitrary ， data from other applications hosted on the same server could also ， be compromised , depending on the configuration of MySQL. ， Details :  ， This vulnerability exists because of a failure in the application ， to properly sanitize user input for the variable \"t_dedupe\".
