Configure /etc/dnsmasq.conf file to listen on the IP and restart DNSMASQ ， listen-address=192.168.1.x ， sudo /etc/init.d/dnsmasq restart ， 5. Add a file with malicious content ( you may need to use sudo )  :  ， cd /var/www/html ， mkdir support ， echo powned >support/privacy ， echo powned >support/terms ， 6.
