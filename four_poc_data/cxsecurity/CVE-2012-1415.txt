Furthermore PTK's default installation ( following the procedure indicated into PTK's \"INSTALL\" file ) doesn't perform \"http to https\" ， redirection in order to secure http connection by transport layer encryption. To default there isn't https redirection in the authentication ， phase as well as there isn't https redirection during other PTK's activities. If an internal attacker ( the nature of this tool makes difficult ， that PTK may have public ip address ) makes an Man in the Middle attack ( I successfully made it using Dsniff and Ettercap ) the CSRF vulnerability ， found , forcing the administrator/investigator to logout , will aid the attacker to sniff authentication credentials. This condition can occur when ， PTK is used in production environment and the investigator is conducting an analysis about internal people. Of course this logic can be extended ， to any person which has access to internal LAN as an attacker which with a client-based exploit can control a internal client which can reach ， PTK's server. ， This vulnerability is correlated to poor session check into /<ptk_main_directory>/lib/logout.php script. In fact , differently from other php ， script , where there is the php code like the following to session's check :  ， new AuditLog ( 'Unauthorized access to delete_case '.sanitize ( RemoveXSS (  $ _GET [ 'id' ]  )  , PARANOID )  ;  ， header ( \"location : goto_home.php\" )  ;  ， into /<ptk_main_directory>/lib/logout.php there isn't tha above check. This security flaw allows an attacker to force administrator/investigator ， logout using a CSRF vulnerability. ， When an administrator/investigator browses a web pages which contains the following html/javascript code he is forced to logout at the PTK web ， management interface. ， 3 ) Exploit",
