SYNOPSIS ， Release Date : 07/19/2006 ， Affected Application : Cisco CallManager 3.1 and up ( versions prior to 3.1 were not tested but may ， still be vulnerable )  ， Severity If Exploited : High ， Impact : Arbitrary configuration of phone system/Theft of individual phone users' credentials ， Mitigating Factors : Requires user action ( following a link , visiting a resource with an embedded ， redirect )  ， Initial Notification of Vendor : 10/24/2005 ， Discovery : Jake Reynolds , Senior Security Engineer - FishNet Security ， Contributions : Arian Evans , Senior Security Engineer - FishNet Security ， Permanent Advisory Location :  ， XSS+Advisory.htm ， II.

Depending on the scripted payload , these attacks are commonly referred to as cross-site ， scripting ( XSS )  , session riding , and cross-site request forgery ( CSRF ) . Potential threats that can be ， realized through these vulnerabilities could include but are not limited to :  ，  * Deletion of phone system components such as devices , partitions , calling search spaces , etc ，  * Reconfiguration of phone system components such as route plans , global directory , services , etc ，  * Theft of global directory user credentials ，  * Theft of \"Cisco CallManager User Options\" credentials or session token leading to user identity ， spoofing within that specific interface of CallManager ( Utilization of the stolen credentials or",
