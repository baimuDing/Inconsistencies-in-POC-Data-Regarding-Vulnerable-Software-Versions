Due to insufficient validation methods and missing cross server ， side checking mechanisms , unprivileged authenticated users are allowed to modify their access level permissions by tampering and modifying these values ， thus gaining access to priveleged users actions. An unprivileged user is able by using a C # disassembling and debugging tool such as adnspya to tamper ， these values and gain access on hidden and restricted privileged fields or enable hidden forms such as the aAdministrationa currently accessible only to the ， aCIS Administratorsa group. ， = Proof of Concept = ， 1. Connect to the URL and click on the main button to initiate the installation of the ClickOnce CIS application. ， The CIS application starts downloading various required files which are automatically saved under the following folder :  ， C : \\Users\\{Current Logged in User}\\AppData\\Local\\Apps\\2.0 ， 2.When the download is finished the main executable aPerspective.exea is initialized and loaded by the dfsvc.exe which is responsible to check if the application ， is already installed and up to date. ， 3. Close the application and open a disassembling and debugging tool such as dnspy. Use the menu adebuggera and choose the option aDebug an assemblya. ， This will open a dialog box to choose an executable for debugging. ， Navigate to the main executable aPerspective.exea which is installed inside the following directory and press OK :  ， aC : \\Users\\{Current Logged in User}\\AppData\\Local\\Apps\\2.0\\Data\\{name}.WRL\\{name}.AOQ\\ pers.tive_f50e2c1eb6078f5b_0005.0001_c760ec4c4b1ffe6d\\ ， The debugger will stop at the main Entry Point of the application. ， 4. Click aContinuea from the main menu of the application until the login form appears on the screen. ， 5. When the login screen appears , navigate to the aDataHandlea class which is defined inside the aPrespective.data.dlla and should be already decompiled by the dnSpy. ， 6. Insert breakpoints at the following functions inside the DataHandle Class :  ， - UserEntityPrivs ， - UserFieldPrivs ， - UserReportPrivs ， 7. Login to the application with an unprivileged account and then click Continue from the main menu of the dnSpy. The debugger will stop on the first breakpoint at line ， of the function UserEntityPrivs (  ) . The aforeacha loop used inside these lines calls the UserEntityPrivs (  ) function and sets the usersa allowed permissions against visible ， screens and forms. Click on the Locals field at the bottom menu of the dnSpy and navigate to the entity auseEntityPrivs (  ) a section. ， It should be mentioned that the aAdministrationa menu is restricted only for members belonging to aCIS Administratora role while the user ITSECAS1 has no access on it. ， 8. To enable just the administration menu for an unprivileged user just press Continue until the EntityID aAdministrationa appears in the Locals screen of the dnSpy and ， change the following values to true :  ， - AllowAdd ， - AllowDelete ， - AllowEdit ， - AllowExecute ， - AllowFullControl ， - AllowMange ， - AllowReadOnly ， - AllowShare ， - Visible ， 9. Delete the breakpoints and press Continue until the main screen of the thick client appears on the screen. ， While the user is assigned as aGlobal Heada the administration menu accessible only to the admin users appears on his screen. ， This modification provide access rights to change the minimum Password length to 6 characters ， Additionally , using the aforementioned technique it is possible to enable additional restricted and none visible screens for any unauthorized user. ， It should be also be mentioned that using the same technique it was possible to change the usersa report privileges inside the last aforeacha loop. ， 10. Finally , and just after the UserReportPrivs foreach loop finishes , we can modify the usersa global membership permissions before they are applied to his interface. ， Finally it should be mentioned that it is possible to access any submenu on the administration menu and modify values with only exception to create a new user.",
