These are Brute Force and Cross-Site Scripting ， vulnerabilities. ， During 2008-2009 I've disclosed multiple vulnerabilities in Webglimpse ，  ( such as Cross-Site Scripting ,  ， Full path disclosure , Directory Traversal and Authorization bypass ， vulnerabilities. ， SecurityVulns ID : 9436 ， SecurityVulns ID : 9443 ， SecurityVulns ID : 9778 ， SecurityVulns ID : 9876 ， The first hole from them I've found already in 2007 , when found ， vulnerability at site of Britain's Secret Intelligence Service ( MI6 , SIS )  ,  ， which was using this engine. Webglimpse - it's local search engine. ， Affected products :  ， Vulnerable are Webglimpse 2.18.8 and previous versions. It was tested in ， Webglimpse 2.18.7 and 2.18.8 , but the last version 2.20.0 ( released this ， month ) also should be vulnerable. ， Developers of Webglimpse were informed as this time , as four previous times ,  ， but they ignored all of the warnings and haven't fixed all these holes ( at ， least officially ) . ， Details :  ， Brute Force ( WASC-11 )  :  ， Lack of protection against Brute Force attacks can be used to gain access to ， admin panel. At that it's possible to pick up login and password to guest ， account ( if they aren't publicly available )  , which can be easier then to ， admin account , and then to use earlier mentioned Directory Traversal and ， Authorization bypass vulnerabilities to gain access to admin account. ， XSS ( WASC-08 )  :  ， I mentioned about these vulnerabilities at my site ， Best wishes & regards ,  ， MustLive ， Administrator of Websecurity web site",
