    "text": "vul_name : ACLS ineffective in SQL-Ledger and LedgerSMB ， vul_cve : CVE-2007-1923 ， vul_poc : Hi all ;  ， I have decided to finally send to this list a serious security flaw in ， the design of SQL-Ledger ( all versions ) . LedgerSMB ( all versions ) is ， also affected but the problem ( with a workaround ) has been mentioned in ， our documentation since the fork. Ordinarily I would not make a big ， deal out of this ( since we are already clear about why we suggest using ， db accounts for security )  , but I feel that DWS is misrepresenting the ， security of SQL-Ledger and I think people need to be aware of the risk. ， The access control lists associated with users in SQL-Ledger and ， LedgerSMB do nothing more than enable or disable menu items. They do ， not , however , actually prevent access to the application in any ， meaningful way. The reason is that none of the application's functions ， actually check the access control lists before executing. For this ， reason , anyone can access any other part of the application simply by ， typing the required URL in the address bar ( to get a valid url , try ， right-clicking on the data-entry frame and select \"Show only this frame\" ， in Firefox ) . ， Again , my big issue isn't that this is broken in SQL-Ledger but that the ， author seems content to let people not know that it is broken and that ， there are ways to properly secure it. The access control feature is ， advertised at ， ulti-user ， As for a workaround , we have always suggested that this feature is ， inadequate for security purposes and that roles need to be isolated into ， separate database accounts ( which the application does support ) . ， However , this process is cumbersome. The LedgerSMB project intends to ， automate this process properly in 1.3.0 ( perhaps six months away ) . ， Best Wishes ,  ， Chris Travers ， begin : vcard ， fn : Chris Travers ， n : Travers ; Chris ， email ; internet : chris ( at ) metatrontech ( dot ) com [ email concealed ]  ， tel ; work : 509-888-0220 ， tel ; cell : 509-630-7794 ， x-mozilla-html : FALSE ， version : 2.1 ， end : vcard",
