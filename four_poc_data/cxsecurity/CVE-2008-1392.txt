Summary: ， ~ Several critical security vulnerabilities have been addressed ， ~ in the newest releases of VMware's hosted product line. ， 2. Relevant releases: ， ~ VMware Workstation 6.0.2 and earlier ， ~ VMware Workstation 5.5.4 and earlier ， ~ VMware Player 2.0.2 and earlier ， ~ VMware Player 1.0.4 and earlier ， ~ VMware ACE 2.0.2 and earlier ， ~ VMware ACE 1.0.2 and earlier ， ~ VMware Server 1.0.4 and earlier ， ~ VMware Fusion 1.1 and earlier ， 3. Problem description: ， ~ a. Host to guest shared folder (HGFS) traversal vulnerability ， ~ On Windows hosts, if you have configured a VMware host to guest ， ~ shared folder (HGFS), it is possible for a program running in the ， ~ guest to gain access to the host's file system and create or modify ， ~ executable files in sensitive locations. ， NOTE: VMware Server is not affected because it doesn't use host to ， ~ guest shared folders. No versions of ESX Server, including ， ~ ESX Server 3i, are affected by this vulnerability. Because ， ~ ESX Server is based on a bare-metal hypervisor architecture ， ~ and not a hosted architecture, and it doesn't include any ， ~ shared folder abilities. Fusion and Linux based hosted ， ~ products are unaffected. ， ~ VMware would like to thank CORE Security Technologies for ， ~ working with us on this issue. This addresses advisory ， ~ CORE-2007-0930. ， ~ The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) ， ~ has assigned the name CVE-2008-0923 to this issue. ， ~ Hosted products ， ~ VMware Workstation 6.0 upgrade to version 6.0.3 (Build# 80004) ， ~ VMware Workstation 5.5 upgrade to version 5.5.6 (Build# 80404) ， ~ VMware Player 2.0 upgrade to version 2.0.3 (Build# 80004) ， ~ VMware Player 1.0 upgrade to version 1.0.6 (Build# 80404) ， ~ VMware ACE 2.0 upgrade to version 2.0.1 (Build# 80004) ， ~ VMware ACE 1.0 upgrade to version 1.0.5 (Build# 79846) ， ~ b. Insecure named pipes ， ~ An internal security audit determined that a malicious Windows ， ~ user could attain and exploit LocalSystem privileges by causing ， ~ the authd process to connect to a named pipe that is opened and ， ~ controlled by the malicious user. ， ~ The same internal security audit determined that a malicious ， ~ Windows user could exploit an insecurely created named pipe ， ~ object to escalate privileges or create a denial of service ， ~ attack. In this situation, the malicious user could ， ~ successfully impersonate authd and attain privileges under ， ~ which Authd is executing. ， ~ The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) ， ~ has assigned the names CVE-2008-1361, CVE-2008-1362 to these ， ~ issues. ， ~ Windows Hosted products ， ~ VMware Workstation 6.0 upgrade to version 6.0.3 (Build# 80004) ， ~ VMware Workstation 5.5 upgrade to version 5.5.6 (Build# 80404) ， ~ VMware Player 2.0 upgrade to version 2.0.3 (Build# 80004) ， ~ VMware Player 1.0 upgrade to version 1.0.6 (Build# 80404) ， ~ VMware Server 1.0 upgrade to version 1.0.5 (Build# 80187) ， ~ VMware ACE 2.0 upgrade to version 2.0.1 (Build# 80004) ， ~ VMware ACE 1.0 upgrade to version 1.0.5 (Build# 79846) ， ~ c. Updated libpng library to version 1.2.22 to address various ， ~ security vulnerabilities ， ~ Several flaws were discovered in the way libpng handled various PNG ， ~ image chunks.
