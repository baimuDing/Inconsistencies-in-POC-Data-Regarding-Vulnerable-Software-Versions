    "text": "vul_name : iTunes remote memory corruption vulnerability ， vul_cve : CVE-2007-1008 ， vul_poc : Hi ,  ， iTunes for both macosx and win is prone to a remote memory corruption vulnerability when parsing xml. ， iTunes will parse xml when it contacts a touning server which will return the list of radio channels in that format. ， To trigger this bug is sufficent to send to iTunes an xml file containing the following lines :  ， <?die with your boots on?> ， <kb : station_record> ， <kb : station_url_record> ， </kb : station_url_record> ， Unfortunately i dont know how to trigger remote code execution ( if it's possible ) . ， Please let me know of someone is able to \"do something\" with this bug. ， Note that iTunes will always contact pri.kts-af.net as touning server so dns spoofing is mandatory to exploit this issue. ， Also note that in many cases the bug can be triggered only if iTunes had never parsed a valid xml file. ， This bug has been tested against iTunes 7.0.2 on both ppc and intel architectures ， cheers ， -p",
