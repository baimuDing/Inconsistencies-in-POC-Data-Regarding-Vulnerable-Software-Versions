This vulnerability actually consists of many small vulnerabilities , as described further in the blog post. ， Magento is an extremely popular eCommerce platform purchased by eBay at 2011. ， It is used by major corporations , such as Samsung , Nike and Lenovo , and by small online merchants alike. All in all , Magento is used in 250 , 000 online shops , handling approximately 60 Billion dollars a year. ， These statistics , along with the fact Magento stores almost all customer information , makes it an extremely sensitive target , and the main reason I audited it once more. ， The vulnerability assumes one of the RPCs ( REST or SOAP ) is enabled. As both are enabled by default , and one of them is actually required by the system , this assumption will not be a problem in the absolute majority of installations. ， In this document I will use the SOAP API , as XML is more readable in this case. ， This vulnerability works on both the Community Edition and Enterprise Edition of the system. ， I recommend all Magento administrators to update their installations to the 2.0.6 patch. ， Vulnerable Versions ， Magento EE & CE before 2.0.6.",
