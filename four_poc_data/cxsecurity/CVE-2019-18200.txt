This durable keyboard set is equipped with secure ， 2.4 GHz technology and plug and play technology. The elegant mouse works ， on most surfaces due to its precise 1000 dpi sensor. It offers fabulous ， features and ultra slim , portable design.\" ， Due to an insecure implementation of the data communication , the ， wireless keyboard LX390 is prone to keystroke injection attacks. ， Vulnerability Details :  ， SySS GmbH found out that the wireless desktop set Fujitsu LX390 is ， vulnerable to keystroke injection attacks , as the used data ， communication is unencrypted , which is described in the SySS security ， advisory SYSS-2019-010 ( see [ 3 ]  )  , and unauthenticated. ， By analyzing the used radio communication protocol , the so-called data ， whitening or data scrambling mechanism used by the 2.4 GHz radio ， transceiver , and its configuration , an attacker is able to send ， arbitrary keystrokes to a victim's computer system. In this way , an ， attacker can remotely take control over the victim's computer that is ， operated with an affected Fujitsu LX390 wireless desktop set. ， The actual configuration for a specific targeted keyboard regarding the ， used data whitening configuration can be learned by remotely analyzing ， the radio communication. ， In combination with the replay attack described in the SySS security ， advisory SYSS-2019-009 ( see [ 4 ]  )  , a keystroke injection attack allows to ， remotely attack computer systems with an active screen lock , for example ， in order to install malware when the target system is unattended. ， Proof of Concept ( PoC )  :  ， SySS GmbH could successfully perform keystroke injection attacks against ， the Fujitsu wireless desktop set LX390 using a software-defined radio ， in combination with an in-house developed software tool utilizing GNU ， Radio [ 5 ] . ， For the protocol analysis and initial proof-of-concept attacks ,  ， Universal Radio Hacker ( URH )  [ 6 ] was used. ， SySS GmbH could also perform successful keystroke injection attacks ， using another in-house developed software tool in combination with the ， USB radio dongle Crazyradio PA and the nrf-research-firmware by Bastille ， Networks Internet Security written by Marc Newlin ( see [ 7 ] and [ 8 ]  ) .",
