It allows the user to view the structure of MZ , PE and COFF ， files. ， Fileinfo fails to check the sanity of input data , which successfully ， exploited can lead to denying service to the legitimate user or can ， allow injection of additional false information to the displayed ones. ， = Details = ， 1. In a PE file , the IMAGE_IMPORT_DESCRIPTOR contains fields named ， OriginalFirstThunk and FirstThunk. Both of them point to an array of ， IMAGE_THUNK_DATA structures. The structure may contain an RVA address ， of the name of the imported function. If this pointer to the name of ， the function is invalid , Fileinfo raises an Access Violation ， exception , which being unhandled , causes Denial of Service condition. ， This ends up terminating both Fileinfo plugin and the Total Commander ， process. ， 2. In a PE file , the IMAGE_EXPORT_DIRECTORY contains a field named ， AddressOfNames , which points to an array of RVA addresses of function ， names. Just like in point 1 , if the pointer is invalid , Fileinfo ， raises an Access Violation exception , which causes DoS condition. ， 3. In a PE file , the IMAGE_OPTIONAL_HEADER contains an array of ， IMAGE_DATA_DIRECTORY structures called DataDirectory. This structure ， contains , above other , the size of the import directory. Fileinfo ， fails to check this field in the Image File Header tab , which may ， lead to printing out information about false DLL files , that in ， reality are not loaded and not used. ， 4. In a PE file , the IMAGE_IMPORT_DESCRIPTOR contains pointers to ， arrays of pointer to strings , and a pointer to a name of the DLL being ， loaded. Additional to this , IMAGE_EXPORT_DIRECTORY also contains a ， pointer to an array of pointer to strings. If any of this strings is ， malformed , it is written out \"as is\" , without proper handling of \\r ， and \\n characters , and without any size check. This allows to forge ， the string to look like original Fileinfo information in the Image ， File Header tab. This can be used to misinform the user about the ， structure of the PE file , it's imports and exports. ， Additionally , using together points 3. and any other allows to create a ， working PE file , which causes DoS condition to Fileinfo , or misinforms ， the user about the structure of PE file. ， = Proof of concept = ， = Vendor status and solution = ， The vendor has been informed , but has not yet released a patched ， version. ， Until a new-fixed version is released , it is advised to becareful ， = Disclaimer = ， This document and all the information it contains is provided \"as is\" ,  ， without any warranty.
