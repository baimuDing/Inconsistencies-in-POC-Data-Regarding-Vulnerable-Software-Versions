For example ， it is possible to insert basic HTML tags , such as \"img\" or \"b\" and have the ， image and bold text placed in the output PDF. ， The library allows also to include custom CSS rules by defining a \"link\" ， tag , like the following :  ， <link type=\"text/css\" href=\"style.css\"> ， While it is a nice feature to have for the developer , it may cause problems ， in case the PDF creation script is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting ( or ， \"Code Injection\" ) issues through which an attacker can inject arbitrary ， HTML code. For example during an invoice creation , an attacker can use its ， information written on the invoice to insert a malicious \"link\" tag ， pointing to a local phar archive and trigger a PHP Object Injection through ， the phar : / scheme once the web application reads that file. ， Exploit ， In order to test this vulnerability it's enough to clone the project from ， github and checkout a vulnerable version , such as 6.2.19 : ",
