    "text": "vul_name : Postfix Linux-only local denial of service ， vul_cve : CVE-2008-4042 , CVE-2008-3889 ， vul_poc : An on-line version of this announcement is available at ， Summary :  ， Postfix 2.4 and later , on Linux kernel 2.6 , is vulnerable to a ， denial of service attack by a local user. There is no breach of ， data confidentiality or data integrity. This problem was found by ， the Postfix author during routine source code maintenance. ， Discussion :  ， Postfix is an open-source mail transfer agent ( MTA ) that runs on ， multiple types of UNIX systems. Postfix 2.4 ( released 2007 )  ， introduces input/output event handling based on high-performance ， primitives : BSD kqueue ( also present in MacOS X )  , Linux epoll , and ， Solaris /dev/poll. These implement more scalable event handling ， than the older select (  ) and poll (  ) primitives. ， With 2.6 Linux kernels , Postfix 2.4 and later has an epoll file ， descriptor leak when it executes non-Postfix commands in , for ， example , a user's $ HOME/.forward file. A local user can access a ， leaked epoll file descriptor to implement a denial of service attack ， on Postfix. The attack may result in reduced Postfix performance ,  ， or in automatic Postfix shutdown when an internal safety mechanism ， triggers. Some possible attacks are discussed in the last paragraph ， of this section. ， Not affected is Postfix input/output event handling based on BSD ， kqueue and Solaris /dev/poll. There , the kernel effectively revokes ， access to the underlying kernel object when it creates a child ， process with fork (  )  , keeping the kernel object normally accessible ， only by the process that creates it. ， The above approaches could help to improve the consistency of Linux ， input/output event notification. Currently , 1 ) different Linux ， processes may make conflicting updates to a shared epoll instance ;  ， 2 ) therefore , the Linux kernel may report input/output events to ， processes that didn't ask for those events ; and 3 ) those events may ， involve activity on pipes , sockets , etc. that aren't open in those ， processes. Such inconsistency could be avoided when an epoll ， instance were normally accessible only by the process that creates ， it. ， Workaround :  ， Allow only trusted users to control delivery to non-Postfix commands. ， In the following example , the directory /var/forward is not writable ， by users , and Postfix is configured to search for /var/forward/username ，  ( plus optional address extension ) instead of the default location ，  ~ username/.forward ( plus optional address extension ) . ， /etc/postfix/main.cf :  ， forward_path = /var/forward/ $ {user} $ {recipient_delimiter} $ {extension} ,  ， /var/forward/ $ {user} ， Other workarounds would be required for other mail filtering software ， that executes commands in user-controlled configuration files.",
