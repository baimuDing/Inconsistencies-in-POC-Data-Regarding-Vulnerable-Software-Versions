SIP is an ASCII based INVITE message is used to initiate and ， maintain a communication session. ， Affected devices: Grandstream SIP Phone GXV-3000 with latest available ， firmware 1.0.1.7 Loader- 1.0.0.6 Boot-1.0.0.18 ， Impact : ， A malicious user can remotely eavesdrop (a remote location) and perform DOS ， on a remote phone. ， Resolution ， Fixed software will be available from the vendor and customers following ， recommended best practices (ie segregating VOIP traffic from data) will be ， protected from malicious traffic in most situations. ， The vulnerability is based in a sequence of two messages, where both ， messages are syntactically right, but together they turn the device in an ， inconsistent state, where the RTP is now send to the attacker/ ， ougui at 152.81.48.94:5060 is the attacker ， 1005 at 152.81.48.88:5060 the attacked phone ， X - INVITE -> ， GXV-3000 ， X <- 100 Trying - ， GXV-3000 ， X <- 180 Ringing - ， GXV-3000 ， X - 183 Session Progress -> GXV-3000 ， X <-RTP - FLOW - GXV-3000 ， After these messages the device is not able to hang up so a remote DOS can ， be also done"
