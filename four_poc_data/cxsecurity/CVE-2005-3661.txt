BACKGROUND ， The Dell TrueMobile 2300 Wireless Broadband Router is an 802.11b/g ， wireless access point , wired ethernet switch and internet router. More ， information can be found at the following URL :  ， II. DESCRIPTION ， Remote exploitation of a design error in Dell Inc.'s TrueMobile 2300 ， Wireless Router may allow an attacker to reset the authentication ， credentials. ， The Dell TrueMobile 2300 is a wireless router and access point. By ， requesting the following url from the router , it is possible to obtain ， a page containing a form which allows you to reset the authentication ， credentials. ( The IP is typically 192.168.2.1 , and [ ROUTER IP ] should ， be replace by the router's actual address. )  ， IP ] /apply.cgi?Page=adv_password.asp&action=ClearLog ， Although dialog boxes for entering the username and password appear ,  ， pressing cancel will not prevent this exploit from working. ， III. ANALYSIS ， Exploitation could allow remote attackers to associate with the ， internal side of the router to change any configuration settings ,  ， including uploading of new firmware. ， The precise cause of the error is unknown. Although there is GPL ， source code available for this product , the firmware's source code ， version has not been kept up to date with the binary version. As a ， result , it does not directly allow the cause of the vulnerability to ， be determined. ， Based on analysis of the affected binary , /usr/sbin/httpd , and the ， previous version of the source code it appears the cause is a logic ， error involving the 'ClearLog' string being checked without first ， ascertaining that the page was one where that made sense. Although ， the binary appears to be largely the same code as the available source ， code , there are many differences. In the binary version , the ， authentication is not performed in the same order as in the source ， version. It is likely that the determination of which pages to check ， is now done on the basis of the 'action' variable , rather than the ， previous method of using the page name. ， IV. DETECTION ， iDefense has confirmed the existence of this vulnerability in the ， following Dell TrueMobile 2300 firmware versions :  ， ? 3.0.0.8 , dated 07/24/2003 ， ? 5.1.1.6 , dated 1/31/2004 ， Previous versions of this may also be affected , however it is not ， clear in which version the vulnerability was introduced. ， V. WORKAROUND ， In order to mitigate exposure to this vulnerability from remote ， attackers , employ encryption on your wireless interface , or disable it ， wireless security policy. This workaround does not prevent exploitation ， from the local network via wired interfaces. ， VI. VENDOR RESPONSE ， \"The vendor is no longer selling this product and has replaced it with ， newer models that do not exhibit the defect. Therefore , a patch will not ， be released to address this issue.\" ， VII. CVE INFORMATION ， The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures ( CVE ) project has assigned the ， name CVE-2005-3661 to this issue. This is a candidate for inclusion in ， the CVE list ( which standardizes names for ， security problems.",
