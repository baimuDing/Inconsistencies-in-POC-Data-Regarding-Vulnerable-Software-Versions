TITLE ， Using Blended Browser Threats involving Chrome to steal files on your ， computer ， II. VULNERABLE ， Chrome all versions < 3.0.195.32 ， Tests performed on v3.0.195.25 ， III. BACKGROUND ， Google Chrome is a web browser released by Google which uses the WebKit ， layout engine and application framework. It is one of the four most popular ， browsers in the market today. Google released the entire source code of ， Chrome , including its bespoke V8 JavaScript engine as an open source project ， entitled Chromium , in 2008. Google Chrome is best known for its fast speed ,  ， simplicity and reliability. ， IV. DESCRIPTION ， Google Chrome has an inbuilt file downloader [ 1 ]  , just like every other ， browser. However , the behavior of this function is different from other ， browsers and provides users much more usability and convenience. Chrome ， automatically downloads a file from any site that is passed using the ， Content-Disposition header value \"attachment\" ( on the contrary , all other ， browsers show a save as dialog ) . There are some mitigations done by Chrome ， to protect users from auto downloading malware by raising an alert on ， executable extensions such as .exe , .htm , .jar , etc. ， The vulnerability arises from the fact that there are other extensions such ， as .svg , .mht , .mhtml that don't exist in the Chrome's malicious extension ， blacklist and hence the user never gets a warning message before they are ， auto downloaded to his or her computer. If these downloaded files are ， clicked from the Chrome's download bar or Windows Explorer ( which the user ， is highely likely to click considering his or her trust in Chrome that it ， warns for malicious extensions )  , they will automatically get opened in other ， browsers and can be used to steal any file on the user's computer. ， The reason for the name \"Blended Browser Threats\" is because here , Google ， Chrome is used as a vehicle for attack , whereas the real vulnerability ， executes inside other browsers such as IE6 , Safari on your computer. The ， vulnerability is not directly exploitable in IE6 , Safari since an evil site ， cannot automatically download content on your computer without your ， permission. Another important point to note here is you might not be using ， the browsers IE6 , Safari and instead using Chrome. But clicking a particular ， file on Chrome's download bar can make it automatically open in IE6 , Safari. ， See the proof of concept examples below. ， V. PROOF OF CONCEPT ， 1. The MHT , MHTML ( MIME HTML ) file format is used by Internet Explorer to ， embed all external resources , usually images , in a single document. ， Basically , whenever you click \"Save As\" on a web page , this is the default ， format used to save it. So , MHT , MHTML files gets automatically opened in IE ， when clicked. The exploit I want to discuss is interesting in the context of ， IE6 ( estimated to be installed on roughly 25% of the computers ) . For other ， newer versions like IE7 , IE8 , the user is explicitly prompted about the ， danger of executing javascript and hence much harder to exploit. ， An evil site opened inside Chrome can automatically download a MHT/MHTML ， file to your computer. If the user clicks on this downloaded file from the ， Chrome's download bar or opens this file through Windows Explorer , it gets ， automatically opened in IE6. The malicious script executes and can be used ， to send any of your local files to a remote evil destination. Ex : Click on ， this link- ， ?fna ， me=WATCHMENAKED.mhtml ，  ( Image )  ， 2. The SVG ( Scalable Vector Graphics ) file is a registered extension in some ， Safari versions and hence a SVG file gets automatically opened in Safari. If ， you ever had an older version of Safari on your computer , this extension ， will be most probably there in your registry. Hence , it does not matter what ， your current version of Safari is ( and you may very well be using the latest ， version of Safari ) . So the exploit works like this :  ， An evil site opened inside Chrome can automatically download a SVG file to ， your computer. If the user clicks on this downloaded file from the Chrome's ， download bar or opens this file through Windows Explorer , it gets ， automatically opened in Safari. The malicious script executes and can be ， used to send any of your local files to a remote evil destination. Ex : Click ， on this link- ， ?fna ， me=WATCHMENAKED.svg ，  ( Image )  ， 3. An evil site opened inside Chrome can automatically download ， inappropriate content such as a por_ographic image to your computer. Ex :  ， Click on this link- ， ?fna ， me=WATCHMENAKED.jpg ，  ( Image )  ， VI. FIX DESCRIPTION ， Google Chrome Team fixed this vulnerability by appending these dangerous ， extensions such as .mht , .mhtml , .svg , etc to already existing extension ， blacklist. ， Check out the fixes done in Chromium Source Code here [ 2 , 3 ] . ， Chrome Team is also actively looking how to improve this mechanism in the ， long run , but because of the need to maintain compatibility with certain ， existing uses , this needs to be done carefully. ， VII. SOLUTION ， Chrome : Upgrade to latest version of Google Chrome ( v3.0.195.32 or higher ) . ， If you remain connected to the internet , this should be automatic. ， The more secure solution is to configure your browser to prompt you ， explicitly before downloading any file type. This can be done by going to ， Chrome Configuration Options -> Under the Hood -> Check the 'Ask where to ， save each file before downloading' flag. ， VIII. ， 1.
