These capabilities can be configured and enforced system-wide ， or on a per-application basis for specific programs such as email ， readers, Web browsers, media players, messaging software, etc. The ， security framework provided by CORE FORCE is leveraged by a community of ， security experts that share their security configurations for a growing ， list of programs. These security profiles can be downloaded by any user ， of CORE FORCE from the community Web site and they're also completely ， open so that they can be peer-reviewed to minimize security hazards. ， Locally exploitable kernel buffer overflow vulnerabilities and unproperly ， validated input arguments have been found in CORE FORCE Firewall and ， Registry modules. The vulnerabilities allow unprivileged logged on users ， to crash the system (denial of service), and they also may lead to a ， privilege escalation or even a local root exploit. ， *Vulnerable packages* ， - - CORE FORCE 0.95.167 and below. ， *Non-vulnerable packages* ， - - CORE FORCE 0.95.172. ， *Vendor Information, Solutions and Workarounds* ， This vulnerability was fixed in CORE FORCE version 0.95.172 which is ， available at: ， *Credits* ， This vulnerability was discovered by Sebastian Gottschalk."
