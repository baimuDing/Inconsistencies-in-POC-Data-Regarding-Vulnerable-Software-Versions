For circumventing blocks based solely on the DNS name it is sufficient to arrange the HTTP request so that the request line and the Host header end up in separate packets. ， Example :  ， packet 1 : GET / HTTP/1.0 ， X-SomeHeader : . ， . ， packet 2 : X-SomeOtherHeader : . ， Host : www.blocked.com ， . ， The vulnerability has been identified in version 2.0.05.33. However , other versions may be also affected.",
