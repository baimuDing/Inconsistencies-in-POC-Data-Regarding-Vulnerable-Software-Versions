    "text": "vul_name : 3S CODESYS Gateway 2.3.9.27 Gateway Use After Free ， vul_cve : CVE-2013-2781 ， vul_poc : This advisory provides mitigation details for a vulnerability that impacts the 3S CODESYS Gateway application. ， OVERVIEW ， Independent researcher Nicholas Miles has identified a denial-of-service ( DoS ) vulnerability in the 3S CODESYS Gateway application. 3S has produced an update that mitigates this vulnerability. Nicholas Miles has tested this update and validates that it resolves the vulnerability. ， Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could cause a DoS condition and may also allow the possibility of remote execution of arbitrary code. ， The Gateway-Server is a third-party component found in multiple control systems manufacturer& # 8217 ; s products. This vulnerability could be exploited remotely. ， AFFECTED PRODUCTS ， The following 3S products are affected :  ， CODESYS Gateway , Version 2.3.9.27 ， This product is also used in many products sold by other vendors. Control systems vendors should review their products , identify those that incorporate the affected software , and take appropriate steps to update their products and notify customers. ， IMPACT ， If exploited , an attacker could use this vulnerability to remotely cause a DoS with a system crash within the Gateway server application. Remote execution of arbitrary code may also be possible. ， Impact to individual organizations depends on many factors that are unique to each organization. ICS& # 8209 ; CERT recommends that organizations evaluate the impact of this vulnerability based on their operational environment , architecture , and product implementation. ， BACKGROUND ， According to the 3S-Smart Software Solutions GmbH Web site , a CODESYS is used in virtually all sectors of the automation industry by manufacturers of industrial controllers or intelligent automation devices , by end users in many different industries , or by system integrators who offer automation solutions with CODESYS. ， This vulnerability affects products primarily found in the energy , critical manufacturing , and industrial automation industries. ， VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW ， USE AFTER FREEb ， The vulnerability is caused by referencing memory that has been previously freed by the process. This condition commonly causes a system crash and may also present the possibility for execution of arbitrary code. ， CVE-2013-2781c has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v2 base score of 10.0 has been assigned ; the CVSS vector string is ( AV : N/AC : L/Au : N/C : C/I : C/A : C ) .d ， VULNERABILITY DETAILS ， EXPLOITABILITY ， This vulnerability could be exploited remotely. ， EXISTENCE OF EXPLOIT ， No known public exploits specifically target this vulnerability. ， DIFFICULTY ， An attacker with a low skill would be able to exploit this vulnerability. ， MITIGATION ， 3S has produced a patch that is available for download from the 3S CODESYS Download page :  ， Please contact CODESYS Support for any additional questions concerning the update. ， ICS& # 8209 ; CERT encourages asset owners to take additional defensive measures to protect against this and other cybersecurity risks. ， Minimize network exposure for all control system devices. Critical devices should not directly face the Internet. ， Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls , and isolate them from the business network. ， When remote access is required , use secure methods , such as Virtual Private Networks ( VPNs )  , recognizing that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices. ， ICS-CERT also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS-CERT Web page. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download , including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.e ICS& # 8209 ; CERT reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to taking defensive measures. ， Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available in the ICS& # 8209 ; CERT Technical Information Paper , ICS-TIP-12-146-01B& # 8212 ; Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies , f that is available for download from the ICS-CERT Web page (  ， Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to ICS& # 8209 ; CERT for tracking and correlation against other incidents. ， a.
