The thing with ，  * Don's exploit is that it relies on having a known location ，  * of allproc , which means having access to the kernel or ，  * debugging symbols , either of which might not be available. ，  * Initial attempts included a general memory search for some ，  * characteristics of allproc , but this was difficult to make ，  * reliable. This solution here is a much more standard - get ，  * the current thread , change its permissions , and execl to ，  * shell. Additionally , it breaks out of chroots and freebsd ，  * jails by reparenting to pid 1 and copying its fds. ，  * This reliably works on kernels on or below 6.4-RELEASE :  ，  *  $ gcc a.c ，  *  $ ./a.out ，  *  ~ FreeBSD <= 6.4-RELEASE Netgraph Exploit ~  ，  * by zx2c4 ，  * greetz to don bailey , edemveiss ，  *  [ + ] mmapping null page ，  *  [ + ] adding jmp to pwnage in null page ，  *  [ + ] opening netgraph socket ，  *  [ + ] triggering null dereference ，  *  [ + ] elevating permissions ，  *  [ + ] got root !  ，  * It's an oldie , but simple enough that someone needed ，  * to write another PoC exploit at some point. ，  * cheers ,  ，  * zx2c4 , 27-2-2011",
