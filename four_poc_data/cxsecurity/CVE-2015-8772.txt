    "text": "vul_name : McAfee File Lock Driver Kernel Memory Leak ， vul_cve : CVE-2015-8772 ， vul_poc :  * CVE : CVE-2015-8772 ，  * Vendor : McAfee - Intel Security ，  * Reported by : Kyriakos Economou ，  * Date of Release : 26/01/2016 ，  * Date of Fix : N/A ，  * Affected Products : Multiple ，  * Affected Version : McPvDrv.sys v4.6.111.0 ，  * Fixed Version : N/A ， Description :  ， McAfee File Lock Driver does not handle correctly IOCTL_DISK_VERIFY IOCTL requests , which leads to kernel memory leak through specifically crafted IOCTLs. Normally the IOCTL_DISK_VERIFY IOCTL is used to verify an extent on a fixed disk and doesn't return any data. ， We have verified this issue in the latest McAfee File Lock v5.x which ships with McAfee total protection suite. However , other products that include this package will also be affected. ， Vulnerable module : McPvDrv.sys v4.6.111.0 ， Earlier versions of this kernel driver are probably affected by the same issue. ， Impact :  ， A local attacker might be able to disclose sensitive information from kernel memory or crash the affected host. ， Technical Details :  ， When we send an IOCTL_DISK_VERIFY IOCTL request the input buffer parameter of DeviceIoControl function must be a pointer to a VERIFY_INFORMATION data structure. ， typedef struct _VERIFY_INFORMATION { ， LARGE_INTEGER StartingOffset ;  ， DWORD Length ;  ， } VERIFY_INFORMATION ,  * PVERIFY_INFORMATION ;  ， The kernel memory leak is generated by the fact that the McPvDrv.sys driver doesn't validate the VERIFY_INFORMATION.Length which is controlled by our input buffer. Furthermore , the driver trusts that value as the size of the input buffer allocated in kernel space , causing the associated function to read data passed the size of the specified input buffer and read arbitrary data from kernel address space back to userland into a specified output buffer. ， Disclosure Log :  ， Vendor Contacted : 16/09/2015 ， Request for feedback : 21/09/2015 - No response ， Request for feedback : 08/10/2015 - No response ， Request for feedback : 13/01/2016 - No response ， Public Disclosure : 26/01/2016 ， Copyright :  ， Copyright ( c ) Nettitude Limited 2016 , All rights reserved worldwide.",
