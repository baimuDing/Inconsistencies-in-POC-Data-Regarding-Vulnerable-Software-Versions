INTRODUCTION ， ePortfolio is a e-banking application by TKS Banking Solutions. ， More information is available on the vendors web site at the following URL :  ， II. DESCRIPTION ， Stefan Friedli found several web-based vulnerabilities that were ， identified in ePortfolio version 1.0 Java and may affect earlier ， versions as well. ， The application uses heavy amounts of javascript code for operation. As ， this is not generally a bad thing , it causes massive problems when it ， comes to data validation. As we recognized , the entire validation of ， input is realized by client-side javascript which can easily be bypassed ， using a Proxy BURPproxy or WebScarab to modify original requests sent ，  ( and validated ) by the browser. ， We assume this vulnerability to exist in nearly every form offered by ， the application. Due to the limited functionality of the account used ， PoC Code is not being published. ， IV. IMPACT ， As there is a serious lack of server-side measured to protect the ， application from malicious input , an attacker may realize nearly every ， attack that relies on lacking input-validation which includes Cross Site ， Scripting and Cross-Site Request Forgery ( Session Riding ) . ， V. DETECTION ， Detection of web based attacks requires a specialized web proxy and/or ， intrusion detection system. Patterns for detection of basic attacks are ， available and easy to implement , though they may possibly fail on more ， sophisticated attacks. ， VI. SOLUTION ， Server-side input validation should be provied by the application vendor ， as soon as possible. ， VII. VENDOR RESPONSE ， The problems were recognized and will , according to the vendor , be ， adressed with the next release by the end of this week. Further , the ， vendor claims to be able to change the faulty behaviour remotely or by ， editing a non-specified file for existing customers. ， VIII.
