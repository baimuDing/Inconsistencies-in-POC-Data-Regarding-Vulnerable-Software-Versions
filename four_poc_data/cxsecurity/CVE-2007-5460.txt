This enables malicious ， software on the host to either impersonate a device in order to obtain ， the current password or , if in a position to sniff network traffic , obtain ， the password for trivial decoding. ， Details :  ， When a device is docked via USB it uses the connection like a standard ， network interface. Once an IP address is obtained the device will ， initially communicate via RAPI with the host on port 990/TCP. It will ， go through a small handshake routine and then , if appropriate , challenge ， the host for the devices PIN or Password. When the user supplies this ， PIN/Password on the host it will be obfuscated via XOR with a fixed key ， of E9 and then sent over the USB network connection to the device for ， verification. ， This process results in two vulnerabilities. Firstly , should an attacker ， be in a position to sniff the host computer's network connection he will ， be able to recover the PIN/Password. Secondly , an attacker can spoof the ， docking process of the device in an attempt to get the user to supply ， his PIN/Password. ， If we take a sample packet :  ， 0000 82 00 60 0f e8 00 80 00 60 0f e8 00 08 00 45 00 .`. `.E. ， 0010 00 32 59 95 40 00 80 06 49 31 a9 fe 02 02 a9 fe .2Y.

After which is the password obfuscated with E9 , this is immediately ， apparent due to the use of a UNICODE string for the password so every second ， byte is 0x00 XOR 0xE9 which equals 0xE9.",
