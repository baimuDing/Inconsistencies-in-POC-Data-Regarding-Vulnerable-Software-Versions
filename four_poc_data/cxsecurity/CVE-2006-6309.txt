For further product information on the TippingPoint IPS :  ， - Vulnerability Details :  ， These vulnerabilities allow attackers to execute arbitrary code on ， vulnerable installations of IBM Tivoli Storage Manager. Authentication ， is not required to exploit these vulnerabilities. ， The specific flaws are similar and exist in the processing of messages ， by the Tivoli Storage Manager service , bound on TCP port 1500. The ， messages are structured in the form [ index ]  [ size ] . The 'index' field ， specifies an integer offset into the body of the message for a specific ， field , and the 'size' field specifies the size of the indexed field. ， As no validation is done on the index fields , an attacker can force the ， service to look beyond the end of the packet , often landing in ， unallocated memory and resulting in a denial of service. ， The size fields are often checked to ensure they do not exceed the ， bounds of the destination buffers that data is being copied to. ， However , we have found the following four instances where the size ， files are left unchecked :  ， Overflow 1 ， The initial sign-on request contains a field to specify the language. ， In normal cases we've seen , this string is dscenu.txt. Typically the ， server will validate that the language string is no longer than 0x100 ， bytes. However , if the first byte of the language string is 0x18 , this ， check will not occur , and a fixed sized buffer will be overrun. ， Overflows 2 and 3 ， There is an overflow vulnerability in messages processed by the ， SmExecuteWdsfSession function. There are two fields in this request ,  ， both are copied into fixed sized buffers , without any validation of ， their lengths. ， Overflow 4 ， There is an overflow in the open registration message due to an ， unchecked copy into a fixed size buffer for the contact field of the ， registration. ， All four of the above detailed overflows can lead to arbitrary code ， execution under the context of the Tivoli service.",
