Here are a few points where this situation can be exploited (if register_globals is active and if the current user is logged in as admin): ， adminfunctions.php, line 531 ， r&password=xyz&confpass=xyz&realname='&type=<script>alert('hi')</script> ， adminfunctions.php, line 561 ， eviluser&password=xyz&confpass=xyz&realname='&type=<script>alert('hi')</ ， script> ， editcatalogue.php, line 523 ， ogue_id='<script>alert('hi')</script>&uploaded=true&submit=true&AddRemai ， ning=true ， [there has to be at least one file with a valid extension in the uploads directory] ， editcatalogue.php, line 581 ， ogue_id=777&uploaded=true&submit=true&catalogue_id='<script>alert('hi')< ， /script> ， The above vulnerabilities are also SQL Injection vulnerabilities. ， Some analogous cases in search.php: ， search.php, line 120: ， The $query variable can contain malicious user input due to the assignments on lines 90-112. ， search.php, line 152: ， $cf_query is tainted by $cfid, which is tainted by $tempCustomFieldID, which is tainted by $HTTP_POST_VARS (line 138). ， search.php, lines 243-250: ， There are calls to getValueFromID with $item_list as parameter, which can be controlled by an attacker. ， Solution ， The authors have responded to our message quickly and have released version 0.7.0.1, which fixes the above issues."
