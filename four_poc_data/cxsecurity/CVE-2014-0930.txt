This can be achieved by manipulating the parameters ， that are passed to the ptrace (  ) system call when performing the ， PT_LDINFO operation. ， By calling ptrace ( PT_LDINFO , childpid , leakbuffer , maximumleak , NULL )  ， with a value of maximumleak that greater than that required for the ， expected result of the PT_LDINFO operation , the AIX kernel will ， xmalloc (  ) this space ( without initialising it )  , populate it and then ， perform a copy operation that returns the result within leakbuffer. ， Further details at :  ， Copyright :  ， Copyright ( c ) Portcullis Computer Security Limited 2014 , All rights ， reserved worldwide.
