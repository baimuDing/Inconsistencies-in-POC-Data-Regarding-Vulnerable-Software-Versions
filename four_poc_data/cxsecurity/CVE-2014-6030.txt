It is vulnerable to multiple SQL injection attacks , both ， authenticated and unauthenticated. The authenticated vulnerability ， resides within the file upload script , as the parameters are not ， sanitized prior to being placed into the SQL query. ClassApps had ， previously listed 'SQL injection protection' as a feature and did have ， several functions in place to attempt to prevent such attacks but due to ， using a \"blacklisting\" approach , it is possible to circumvent these ， functions. These functions are used elsewhere throughout the application ， to protect GET request variables but are not sufficient. Only this ， specific version of the application has been tested but it is highly ， likely these vulnerabilities exist within prior versions. It has not ， been confirmed that these vulnerabilities are fixed. The vendor stated ， that they would be fixed in this new release however , they do not allow ， download of the code unless you are a customer so fixes have not been ， verified. ， Examples ， /survey/ReviewReadOnlySurvey.aspx?ResponseID=<num>&SurveyID= [ SQLi ]  ，  ( unauthenticated )  ， /survey/UploadImagePopupToDb.aspx?ResponseID=<num>&SurveyID= [ SQLi ]  ，  ( authenticated )  ， sqlmap identified the following injection points :  ， Place : GET",
