The original email/advisory is available at ， and ， This issue is being tracked by Cisco Bug IDs CSCse26754 and ， CSCse26719. ， The attacks described in the report take advantage of a weakness in ， the default configuration of the Cisco ACS. Cisco is investigating ， this issue and further detail will be added to the Cisco Security ， Response as it becomes available. ， Cisco's statement and further information are available on the Cisco ， public website at ， Contact psirt ( at ) cisco ( dot ) com [ email concealed ] with any questions regarding this issue. ， Regards ,  ， Clay ， On Fri , Jun 23 , 2006 at 09 : 18 : 51AM -0400 , Darren Bounds wrote :  ， > Cisco Secure ACS Weak Session Management Vulnerability ， > June 23 , 2006 ， > ， > Product Overview :  ， > Cisco Secure Access Control Server ( ACS ) provides a centralized ， > identity networking solution and simplified user management experience ， > across all Cisco devices and security management applications. ， > ， > Cisco Secure ACS is a major component of Cisco trust and identity ， > networking security solutions.
