    "text": "vul_name : swfupload_f8.swf Cross Site Scripting ， vul_cve : CVE-2012-3414 ， vul_poc : Hello list !  ， I will draw your attention to XSS vulnerability in other web applications ， with swfupload. Earlier I've wrote about swfupload in AionWeb , Magento ,  ， Liferay Portal , SurgeMail , symfony and that this hole is available in many ， other web applications. ， In previous letters I've wrote concerning web applications with ， swfupload.swf and swfupload_f9.swf ( which are for Flash Player 10 and Flash ， Player 9 ) . And now I'll write about web applications with swfupload_f8.swf ，  ( which is for Flash Player 8 ) . Here is information about Archiv plugin for ， TinyMCE , Squeeze Documents for SPIP , Upload Manager for Radiant CMS ,  ， AionWeb , Liferay Portal ( Community Edition , which earlier called Standard ， Edition , and Enterprise Edition )  , SurgeMail , symfony - among multiple web ， applications which are bundled with swfupload_f8.swf. ， Affected products :  ， Vulnerable are potentially all versions of Archiv plugin for TinyMCE ,  ， Squeeze Documents for SPIP , Upload Manager for Radiant CMS , AionWeb , Liferay ， Portal ( Community Edition , which earlier called Standard Edition , and ， Enterprise Edition )  , SurgeMail , symfony. There is no information that they ， have fixed this vulnerability in their software ( at that this vulnerability ， was fixed in WordPress 3.3.2 at 20.04.2012 ) . ， The developers of WordPress released new version of flash file ( the same did ， the developers of XenForo )  , which could be used by all web developers , which ， were using swfupload. But in WordPress and XenForo the swfupload.swf was ， fixed , not swfupload_f8.swf and these are different versions of the same ， flash application ( designed for different versions of Flash Player ) . Taking ， into account current wide spreading of Flash Player 10.x and 11.x , then ， developers of these web applications could replace swfupload_f8.swf with new ， fixed version of Swfupload. ， Details :  ， XSS ( WASC-08 )  :  ， Archiv plugin for TinyMCE :  ， Squeeze Documents for SPIP :  ， Upload Manager for Radiant CMS :  ， AionWeb :  ， AionWeb also contains swfupload_f8.swf , besides described earlier ， swfupload.swf and swfupload_f9.swf. ， Liferay Portal :  ， Liferay Portal also contains swfupload_f8.swf , besides described earlier ， swfupload_f9.swf. ， SurgeMail :  ， SurgeMail also contains swfupload_f8.swf , besides described earlier ， swfupload.swf and swfupload_f9.swf. ， symfony :  ， symfony also contains swfupload_f8.swf , besides described earlier ， swfupload_f9.swf. ， Best wishes & regards ,  ， MustLive ， Administrator of Websecurity web site",
