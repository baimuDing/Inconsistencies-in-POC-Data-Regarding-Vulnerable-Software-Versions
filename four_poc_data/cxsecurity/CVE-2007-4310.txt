Do you intend to provide patches for older ， > OS's? ， At this time there aren't any plans to address 4432153 in Solaris 8 or ， 9. As you may know Solaris 7 is no longer supported. If a service call ， was raised with Sun then patches for Solaris 8 and 9 could be generated. ， > Under RFC 1288 , it seems there should be a mechanism to disable such ， > behavior. It certainly is nonintuitive to most folks that 'finger ， > 9 @ host' will display accounts with the GECOS field as described.

We agree the the behaviour of 'finger ， 9 @ host' returning information about accounts with \"unusual\" whitespace ， in the GECOS field is non-intuitive and was also considered incorrect ， which is why 4432153 was filed. ， Hope this helps. ， Does anyone know of other platforms which exhibit this odd behavior? ， Jim Mellander ， Incident Response Manager ， Computer Protection Program ， Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory ，  ( 510 ) 486-7204",
