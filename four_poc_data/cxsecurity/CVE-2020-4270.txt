This script is executed by the root user's crontab. Due to this ， it is possible for any process running as nobody to add commands to this ， script that will be executed with root privileges. In combination with a ， code execution vulnerability in QRadar's web application , this can be ， used for attacker's to gain full control of the QRadar system. ， See also ， CVE-2020-4270 [ 2 ]  ， 6189657 [ 3 ] - IBM QRadar SIEM is vulnerable to privilege escalation ，  ( CVE-2020-4270 )  ， Tested versions ， This issue was successfully verified on QRadar Community Edition [ 4 ]  ， version 7.3.1.6 ( 7.3.1 Build 20180723171558 ) . ， Fix ， IBM has released the following versions of QRader in which this issue ， has been resolved :  ， - QRadar / QRM / QVM / QNI 7.4.0 GA [ 5 ]  ( SFS )  ， - QRadar / QRM / QVM / QRIF / QNI 7.3.3 Patch 3 [ 6 ]  ( SFS )  ， - QRadar / QRM / QVM / QRIF / QNI 7.3.2 Patch 7 [ 7 ]  ( SFS )  ， - QRadar Incident Forensics 7.4.0 [ 8 ]  ( ISO )  ， - QRadar Incident Forensics 7.4.0 [ 9 ]  ( SFS )  ， Introduction ， QRadar [ 10 ] is IBM's enterprise SIEM [ 11 ] solution. A free version of ， QRadar is available that is known as QRadar Community Edition [ 4 ] . This ， version is limited to 50 events per second and 5 , 000 network flows a ， minute , supports apps , but is based on a smaller footprint for ， non-enterprise use. ， A local privilege escalation vulnerability was found in QRadar. This ， vulnerability is possible because the script located at ， /opt/qvm/iem/bin/run-result-reader.sh is configured with weak file ， permissions. The owner of the script is set to the nobody user , which is ， a low privileged system account use by various services - including ， QRadar's web application. ， The script is also started by the root user's crontab. This means that ， user , it would be possible to escalate privileges to root. This is for ， example possible by exploiting a code execution vulnerability in ， QRadar's web application. ， Details ， The crontab of the root user contains various entries to run commands on ， different moments. One of these entries will run the ， run-result-reader.sh script every 20 minutes :  ，  # crontab -l ，  [ . ]  ，  # Update the Endpoint Manager Fixlet Action Results ，  * /20 *  *  *  * /opt/qvm/iem/bin/run-result-reader.sh > /var/log/iem-cron.log 2>&1 ， This script is owned by the nobody user , meaning that this user fully ， controls the script and thus fully controls which commands will be ， executed. ，  # ls -la /opt/qvm/iem/bin/run-result-reader.sh ， -rwxr-xr-x 1 nobody nobody 2592 Sep 12 17 : 40 ， /opt/qvm/iem/bin/run-result-reader.sh ， If the ( modified ) script is run from root's crontab , the commands within ， the script will be executed with root privileges. Due to this it is ， possible for the nobody to exploit this issue to gain root privileges ， and gain full control of the QRadar system. ，  [ 1 ]  ，  [ 2 ]  ，  [ 3 ]  ，  [ 4 ]  ，  [ 5 ]  ，  [ 6 ]  ，  [ 7 ]  ，  [ 8 ]  ，  [ 9 ]  ，  [ 10 ]  ，  [ 11 ] ",
