XSS attacks occur when an attacker uses a web application to send malicious code , generally in the form of a browser side script , to a different end user. Flaws that allow these attacks to succeed are quite widespread and occur anywhere a web application uses input from a user within the output it generates without validating or encoding it. An attacker can use XSS to send a malicious script to an unsuspecting user. The end users browser has no way to know that the script should not be trusted , and will execute the script. Because it thinks the script came from a trusted source , the malicious script can access any cookies , session tokens , or other sensitive information retained by the browser and used with that site. These scripts can even rewrite the content of the HTML page ，  [ 0x01 ] Description ， IBM Sametime Classic Meeting Server is vulnerable to reflected cross-site scripting , caused by improper validation of user supplied input. A remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability using a specially crafted URL to execute a script in a victim's Web browser within the security context of the hosting Web site , once the URL is clicked. An attacker could use this vulnerability to steal the victim's cookie-based authentication credentials. ，  [ 0x02 ] PoC - Proof of Concept ， For exploit this vulnerability you only need to submit the crafted URL to victim. ， am a XSS' ) </script>< ! -&userLang=pt_BR ， I am a XSS' ) </script>< ! -&Date=2014-07-28 ， Examples :  ，  [ 0x03 ] Correction or Workaround ， Apply the procedures described in the follow link :  ，  [ 0x04 ] Timeline ， 18/07/2014 - Vulnerabilities discovered ， 19/07/2014 - Vulnerabilities reporteds to IBM PSIRT Team ， 23/07/2014 - Advisory and troubleshooting fix published ，  [ 0x05 ] Published ，  [ 0x06 ]  ， OWASP - Cross-site Scripting ( XSS )  ， CWE-264 : Permissions , Privileges , and Access Controls ，  [ 0x07 ] Bibliography ，  [ end ] ",
