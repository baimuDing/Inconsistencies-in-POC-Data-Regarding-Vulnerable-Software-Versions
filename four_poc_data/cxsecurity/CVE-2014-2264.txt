    "text": "vul_name : OpenVPN ( DSM ) 4.3-3810 has a hardcoded root password of synopass ， vul_cve : CVE-2014-2264 ， vul_poc : The default password for user 'root' is 'synopass' and as far as I know there is no way to change it. ， Trying to log in as root through the Web interface or SSH with that password results in authentication failure ( you need to use admin's password for SSH - in fact user 'root' here seems to be an alias for user 'admin' for authentication reasons , and there doesn't seem to be a way to log in as root from the Web interface ) . ， However , when enabling the VPN server , root : synopass will get you authenticated and connected ! User 'root' does not appear under the users that may get VPN access ( VPN server > Privilege ) and , again , there doesn't seem to be a way to change the root password or disable that user from connecting to the VPN. ， Can someone verify this? And can we get a fix asap please? ， I'm using the latest version of \"DSM 4.3-3810 update 1\" and the VPN server application. ， EDIT : One quick and dirty solution is to edit your VPN configuration ( should be under /usr/syno/etc/packages/VPNCenter/openvpn/ ) and substitute the plugin which does the user authentication with something of your own. For instance , since the system has sqlite3 installed , you can write your own bash/perl/python script that maintains an SQLite3 database file with authorized users and their passwords and use that instead. Every time someone will try to connect , OpenVPN will hand off their credentials to your script and expect back 0 for success or 1 for failure. Now you are in true control of the authorized users ! Like I said though , it's a hack. You won't get any support from the DSM Web interface.",
