    "text": "vul_name : Persistent XSS on Aruba 800 Mobility Controller's login page ， vul_cve : CVE-2007-6054 ， vul_poc : Date Found : 17th July 2007 ， Vendor informed : 23rd July 2007 ， Confirmed by vendor : 13th September 2007 ， Description :  ， Aruba 800 is vulnerable to a persistent XSS on the administrator login screen. ， An unauthenticated user can re-write the hidden parameter 'url' by requesting a link under the /screens/ directory :  ， The payload stays intact until another user makes a request under the /screens/ directory , prior to logging in. ， Consequences :  ， An attacker may be able to cause execution of malicious scripting code in the browser of an admin user. Such code would run within the security context of the target domain. ， This type of attack can result in a persistent defacement of the target site , or the redirection of confidential information ( i.e. : admin session IDs , passwords ) to unauthorised third parties. ， Since this XSS is of persistent nature , the admin user wouldn't have to be tricked to visit a specially-crafted URL , but rather simply visit the Aruba 800 login page at some point. ， Severity : High ， Author : Jan Fry [ jan.fry [ at ] procheckup.com ] of ProCheckUp Ltd ( www.procheckup.com )  ， Note : the vulnerability was originally documented by Aruba Networks but no information was provided regarding the exploitation of this XSS vulnerability in a persistent way. Aruba Networks has now updated their 'AID-070907b' advisory to include additional information. ， ProCheckUp thanks Aruba Networks for working with us.",
