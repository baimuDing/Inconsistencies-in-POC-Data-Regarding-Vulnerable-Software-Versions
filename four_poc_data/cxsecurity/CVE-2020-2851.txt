Abstract. ， A difficult to exploit stack-based buffer overflow in the _DtCreateDtDirs (  )  ， function in the Common Desktop Environment version distributed with Oracle ， Solaris 10 1/13 ( Update 11 ) and earlier may allow local users to corrupt memory ， and potentially execute arbitrary code in order to escalate privileges via a ， long X11 display name. The vulnerable function is located in the libDtSvc ， library and can be reached by executing the setuid program dtsession. ， Note that Oracle Solaris CDE is based on the original CDE 1.x train , which is ， different from the CDE 2.x codebase that was later open sourced. In detail , the ， open source CDE is not affected by this specific vulnerability , but following ， our report some additional work has been done by its maintainers to properly ， check bounds in the libDtSvc library. Most notably , insecure calls to strncat (  )  ， that caused buffer overflows have been fixed. ， 2. Example Attack Session.",
