    "text": "vul_name : Microsoft .NET Framework Privilege Escalation ， vul_cve : CVE-2013-0004 ， vul_poc : =ADVISORY= ， Systems Affected : .NET 1.1 through .NET 4.5 ， Severity : Important ， Category : Elevation of Privilege ， Author : Context Information Security ， Reported to vendor : 23th April 2012 ， Advisory Issued : 9th January 2013 ， =ADVISORY= ， Description ， The Microsoft .NET framework is containeds an error in the Intermediate Language ( IL ) verifier which could allow hosted partial trust code to elevate privileges to escape a sandboxed environment resulting in arbitrary code execution with the permissions of the user. ， Analysis ， The .NET framework contains a verifier for IL code which is enabled in partial trust scenarios. This is used to ensure that the code that is to be JITed is logically consistent and does not permit any mechanism of circumventing type safety. ， The vulnerability addressed in the security bulletin is due to a bug in that verification process which allows malicious code to call an objects constructor more than once which would allow an otherwise immutable objects state to be changed leading to common time-of-check/time-of-use issues. ， Technologies Affected ， Microsoft .Net Frameworks 1.1 through 4.5 ， Vendor Response ， Microsoft advises users to patch the .NeETt Framework to the latest version. See the following Microsoft security bulletin for more details :  ， There are a number of mitigations which reduce the severity of the issues which are also detailed in Microsofts bulletin.",
