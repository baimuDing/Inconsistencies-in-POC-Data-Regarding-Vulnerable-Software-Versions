    "text": "vul_name : Apache Tomcat Connection Swallow Denial Of Service ， vul_cve : CVE-2014-0230 ， vul_poc : -BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE- ， Hash : SHA256 ， CVE-2014-0230 Denial of Service ， Severity : Low ， Vendor : The Apache Software Foundation ， Versions Affected :  ， - - Apache Tomcat 8.0.0-RC1 to 8.0.8 ， - - Apache Tomcat 7.0.0 to 7.0.54 ， - - Apache Tomcat 6.0.0 to 6.0.43 ， Description :  ， When a response for a request with a request body is returned to the ， user agent before the request body is fully read , by default Tomcat ， swallows the remaining request body so that the next request on the ， connection may be processed. There was no limit to the size of request ， body that Tomcat would swallow. This permitted a limited Denial of ， Service as Tomcat would never close the connection and a processing ， thread would remain allocated to the connection. ， Note that this issue was accidentally disclosed by Red Hat Product ， Security on 9 April 2015 [ 4 ] . The Tomcat security team was made aware ， of this disclosure today ( 5 May 2015 ) . The information released on 9 ， April 2015 contained a number of errors. For the sake of clarity :  ， - - This issue is not limited to file upload. Any request with a body may ， be affected. ， - - This issue cannot be used to trigger excessive memory usage on the ， server. The additional data read from the response body is not ， retained - it is simply ignored. ， The intention was to embargo this issue until after the 6.0.44 ， release. Unfortunately that is no longer possible. The Tomcat team is ， working on a 6.0.44 release now and we hope to have one available by ， early next week. ， Mitigation :  ， Users of affected versions should apply one of the following mitigations ， - - Upgrade to Apache Tomcat 8.0.9 or later ， - - Upgrade to Apache Tomcat 7.0.55 or later ， - - Upgrade to Apache Tomcat 6.0.44 or later once released ， Credit :  ， This issue was discovered by AntBean @ secdig from the Baidu Security Team ， and was reported responsibly to the Apache Tomcat security team. ，  [ 1 ]  ，  [ 2 ]  ，  [ 3 ]  ，  [ 4 ] ",
