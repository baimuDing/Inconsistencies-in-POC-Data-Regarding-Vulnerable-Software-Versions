It generates templatized HTML to present ， navigable directory, revision, and change log listings. It can ， display specific versions of files as well as diffs between ， those versions. Basically, ViewVC provides the bulk of the ， report-like functionality you expect out of your version ， control tool, but much more prettily than the average textual ， command-line program output.\" ， It was discovered that ViewVC is neither sending a charset HTTP ， header nor specifying a charset in the HTML body. Therefore it ， is possible to trick several browsers into decoding ViewVC pages ， UTF-7. This allows attackers to inject arbitrary UTF-7 encoded ， Java-Script code into the output. ， Please note that these UTF-7 attacks against sites with missing ， charset definitions are also exploitable in the mozilla browser ， family (seamonkey, firefox, .). Advisories from different ， parties that describe similar vulnerabilities usually claim ， that only Internet Explorer with activated auto-detection is ， vulnerable. In reality the mozilla browser family is even more ， affected, because you can attack them no matter if charset ， auto-detection is turned on or off."
