Cisco has made free software available to address this ， vulnerability. There are workarounds available to mitigate the effects ， of the vulnerability. ， This advisory is posted at ， Affected Products ， Vulnerable Products ， +- ， Cisco CSS 11500 Series Content Services Switches running the following ， versions of the Cisco WebNS operating system :  ，  * 7.1 ，  * 7.2 ，  * 7.3 ，  * 7.4 ，  * 7.5 ， The version of Cisco WebNS running on a CSS can be determined by ， running the following command :  ，  # show version ， Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable ， +- ， Cisco CSS 11000 Series Content Services Switches ， No other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by these ， vulnerabilities. ， Details ， The Cisco CSS 11500 Content Service Switch is load balancing device ， designed to provide robust , scalable network services ( Layer 4-7 ) for ， data centers. The Cisco CSS 11500 performs an analysis of protocol ， headers and directs requests to an appropriate resource based on ， configurable policies. With integrated SSL modules , a Cisco CSS 11500 ， can simplify the management of digital cerfiticates and provide SSL ， acceleration services to optimize performance. ， A Cisco CSS 11500 may reload due to a memory corruption issue when ， presented with a malformed digital client certificate during the ， negotiation of a SSL session. This condition is present even if the CSS ， did not request a client certificate during SSL session negotiations. ， This vulnerability is only present if a CSS is configured to support ， SSL termination services. SSL termination services are not configured ， by default. ， Users can determine if SSL termination services are configured on a CSS ， by performing the following steps. ，  * View the current running configuration :  ，  # show running-config ，  * In the Services section of the configuration , users can find ， enabled SSL termination services. An example of an enabled SSL ， termination service called ssl-serv1 will look similar to the ， following. The type command with the option ssl-accel or ， ssl-accel-backend indicates that the service is associated with a ， SSL module , and the active command signifies that a SSL termination ， service is enabled. ， service ssl-serv1 ， type ssl-accel ， slot 3 ， keepalive type none ， add ssl-proxy-list ssl list1 ， active ， The vulnerability is documented in the following Cisco Bug ID :  ，  * CSCee64771 ( registered customers only ) - CSS running SSL may ， crash with malformed client certificates ， Impact ， Successful exploitation of the vulnerability may result in the ， immediate reload of the device. Repeated exploitation could result in a ， sustained DoS attack. ， Software Versions and Fixes ， When considering software upgrades , consult ， products_security_advisories_listing.html ， and any subsequent advisories to determine exposure and a ， complete upgrade solution. ， In all cases , customers should exercise caution to be certain the ， devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and that current ， hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported ， properly by the new release. If the information is not clear , contact ， the Cisco Technical Assistance Center ( \"TAC\" ) for assistance. ， +-+ ，  | Train | Fixed Releases |  ，  | -+- |  ，  | 7.3 | 7.30.4.02 and |  ，  |  | later |  ，  | -+- |  ，  | 7.4 | 7.40.2.02 and |  ，  |  | later |  ，  | -+- |  ，  | 7.5 | 7.50.1.03 and |  ，  |  | later |  ， +-+ ， Customers running Cisco WebNS 7.10 and 7.20 are encouraged to upgrade ， CSS platforms to a fixed version of Cisco WebNS 7.30 or greater.
