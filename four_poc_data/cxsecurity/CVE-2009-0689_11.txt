Developed by The MathWorks , MATLAB allows matrix manipulation , plotting of functions and data , implementation of algorithms , creation of user interfaces , and interfacing with programs in other languages. Although it is numeric only , an optional toolbox uses the MuPAD symbolic engine , allowing access to computer algebra capabilities. An additional package , Simulink , adds graphical multidomain simulation and Model-Based Design for dynamic and embedded systems. ， In 2004 , MathWorks claimed that MATLAB was used by more than one million people across industry and the academic world ， - - 1. Matlab 2009b Array Overrun ( code execution ) - ， The main problem exist in dtoa implementation. Matlab has the same dtoa as Mozilla , OpenBSD , MacOS , Google , Opera etc. ， and it is the same like SREASONRES : 20090625. ， but fix for SREASONRES : 20090625 , used by openbsd was not good. ， More information about fix for openbsd and similars SREASONRES : 20091030 ,  ， We can create any number of float , which will overwrite the memory. In Kmax has defined 15. Functions in dtoa , don't checks Kmax limit , and it is possible to call 16 <= elements of freelist array. ， - - 2. Proof of Concept ( PoC ) - ， There are several ways to make a successful attack. Simplest assumed the creation of a script with a defective floating-point variable and execution it. This will allow the possibility of code execution. ， - -expl.m-",
