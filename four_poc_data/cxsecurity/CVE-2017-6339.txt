It also allows administrators to upload their own certificates signed by root CA. An attacker with low privileges can download current CA certificate and Private Key ( either the default ones or uploaded by administrators ) and use those to decrypt HTTPS traffic thus compromising confidentiality. ， Also , the default Private Key on this appliance is encrypted with very weak and guessable passphrase atrenda. If an appliance uses default Certificate and Private Key provided by Trend Micro , an attacker can simply download these and decrypt the Private Key using default passphrase atrenda.",
