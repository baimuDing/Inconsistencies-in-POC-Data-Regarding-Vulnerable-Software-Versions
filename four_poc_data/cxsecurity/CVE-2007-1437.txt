    "text": "vul_name : DoS and code execution issue in LedgerSMB < 1.1.5 and SQL-Ledger < 2.6.25 ， vul_cve : CVE-2007-1437 ， vul_poc : Hi ;  ， A person on the LedgerSMB core team has found a serious arbitrary code ， execution issue in LedgerSMB prior to 1.1.5 and SQL-Ledger. A version ， of SQL-Ledger which fixes this vulnerability was released today ( version ， 2.6.25 ) . ， The vulnerability allows a user to specify a custom function to run when ， the software encounters an error. The software further assumes that the ， error function specified never returns. For this reason , it is possible ， to cause the software to take alternate paths of execution , and to force ， these paths. This is particularly dangerous for users with valid logins. ， For those which do not have valid login credentials , the problem more ， limited but still quite dangerous. Using this method it is possible to ， overwrite files in the users directory , thus affecting a DoS attack and ， possible authentication bypass. ， The DoS attacks can be done by any user not currently logged in , and can ， force the writing of a nologin file ( which will lock users out of the ， system ) or overwrite the users/members file ( which contains users' ， credentials info and settings ) with invalid data. This attack can be ， done with wget , for example. ， All SQL-Ledger users are advised to upgrade to the latest version , and ， all LedgerSMB users using versions prior to 1.1.5 should upgrade as well. ， Best Wishes ,  ， Chris Travers ， begin : vcard ， fn : Chris Travers ， n : Travers ; Chris ， email ; internet : chris ( at ) metatrontech ( dot ) com [ email concealed ]  ， tel ; work : 509-888-0220 ， tel ; cell : 509-630-7794 ， x-mozilla-html : FALSE ， version : 2.1 ， end : vcard",
