This issue can be ， exploited by loading the filter as an embedded OLE object. When ， instantiating the object Windows will try to load the DLL ehTrace.dll ， from the current working directory. If an attacker convinces the user to ， open a specially crafted (Office) document from a directory also ， containing the attacker's DLL file, it is possible to execute arbitrary ， code with the privileges of the target user. This can potentially result ， in the attacker taking complete control of the affected system. ， See also ， - CVE-2016-0041 ， - MS16-014: Security Update for Microsoft Windows to Address Remote ， Code Execution (3134228) ， Tested versions ， This issue was successfully verified on Windows Vista + Office 2010 ， 32-bit. ， Fix ， Microsoft released MS16-014 that fixes this vulnerability. ， Details"
