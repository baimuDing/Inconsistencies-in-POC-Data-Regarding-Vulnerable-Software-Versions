Get access to all log files from one place. View the latest activity , select logs by date , view a full log file or clear a log file !  ， I've especially emphasized \"clearing a log file\" statement because the feature of \"clearing a log file\" can be used to delete an arbitrary file in a Wordpress web site. The reason of the vulnerability is that , the value of a file path which is going to be deleted is not properly and sufficiently controlled. Name of the parameter leading to the vulnerability is \"rrrlgvwr_clear_file_name\". It can be manipulated only authenticated users. ， An attacker can use this vulnerability ; to destroy the web site by deleting wp-config.php file , or to cover the fingerprints by clearing related log files. ，  # Steps To Reproduce ， 1. Install and activate the plugin. ， 2. Click the \"Log Monitor\" available under Error Log Viewer menu item. ， 3. Choose a log file to clear. ， 4. Intercept the request via Burp or any other local proxy tool. ， 5. Replace the value of the parameter \"rrrlgvwr_clear_file_name\" with a file path which is going to be cleared , such as /var/www/html/wp-config.php. ， 6. Check the content of the cleared file. You will see that the file is empty. ，  # PoC - Supported Materials ， POST /wp-admin/admin.php?page=rrrlgvwr-monitor.php HTTP/1.1 ， Host : 127.0.0.1 : 8000",
