Additionally , the ， application stores sent and received files in the SD card without ， encryption where they are accessible to any applications with storage ， permissions. ， The vendor ( Facebook ) doesnat consider these to be security issues and ， does not plan to fix them. MITRE has assigned CVE-2017-8769 for these ， issues. It is also unclear whether platforms other than Android are ， affected. ， BACKGROUND ， WhatsApp Messenger is a popular cross-platform communication tool that ， allows users to send and receive messages without using more expensive ， protocols like SMS. Additionally the application allows sending and ， receiving of files including audio , contacts , images , videos and ， arbitrary documents. It is estimated that WhatsApp has over 1 billion ， active users and it is owned by Facebook , which also operates the ， largest social networking site in the world. ， One of the main selling points that WhatsApp makes is their commitment ， to user privacy which revolves around the implementation of end-to-end ， encryption via the Signal protocol originally developed by Open ， Whisper Systems. This encryption makes it impossible for Facebook to ， monitor and capture message traffic flowing between users. In some ， extreme cases , Facebook executives have been placed in jail for the ， failure to allow access to messaging data when requested by ， governments. ， Because of the high expectation of privacy by WhatsApp user , it is ， important that the security of the application on the device is also ， properly implemented. In regards to messages , WhatsApp stores them in ， encrypted database but it fails to do the same for files. WhatsApp ， also does not clear files received or sent by the user when the chats ， are cleared. This can result in user data being leaked or stolen by ， malicious applications , law enforcement during illegal searches or ， unwanted actors having access to the device ( aevil maid scenarioa ) . ， DETAILS ， As mentioned above , WhatsApp has ability to send and receive files in ， addition to regular messages. This functionality includes arbitrary ， documents from the file system , contacts , location information , and ， various type of multimedia files including two separate audio formats ，  ( voice notes and recordings )  , images and videos. There is also more ， recent functionality around astatusa images which disappear after 24 ， hours. In order for WhatsApp to access the SD card , users must grant ， storage permissions but in practice most users do so in order to be ， able to exchange files. ， In our research , we have found that WhatsApp for Android stores these ， files on the SD card where they are accessible to other applications ， and does not delete them when chats are cleared , deleted or the ， application is uninstalled. Both sent and received files are retained. ， They are retained on the SD card in the following folder :  ， - /WhatsApp/Media/ ， We have observed that the following file types are retained and not deleted :  ， - /WhatsApp/Media/.Statuses/ ， - /WhatsApp/Media/WhatsApp Audio/ ， - /WhatsApp/Media/WhatsApp Documents/ ， - /WhatsApp/Media/WhatsApp Images/ ， - /WhatsApp/Media/WhatsApp Video/ ， - /WhatsApp/Media/WhatsApp Voice Notes/ ， To replicate the issue :  ， 1. Install WhatsApp for Android. ， 2. Login and exchange messages with another user that contain any of ， the file type listed above. ， 3. Then , install any file manager for Android. ， 4. Navigate to the SD card , and observe the files sent and received ， being located in the directories described above. ， As the next step , try to delete a chat by tapping on the chat , holding ， until the delete option comes up. Delete the chat , and go back to the ， file manager to check. ， As the next step , try going to aSettingsa , aChatsa , aChat Historya and ， selecting either aClear all chatsa or aDelete all chatsa. Go back to ， the file manager and observe the media files still being present. ， As the next step , uninstall WhatsApp. Go back to the file manager , and ， observe the media files still being there. ， All testing was done on Android 7 , and WhatsApp Messenger v2.17.146. ， It is unclear whether other platforms are affected. ， VENDOR RESPONSE AND MITIGATION STEPS ， The vendor ( Facebook ) doesnat consider these to be security issues and ， has no plans to fix them. Vendor response is as follows :  ， Thanks again for your report. We contacted the WhatsApp team about ， your report , and they confirmed that the behavior you describe is ， intentional. They designed the Android app to optimize for the storage ， space available on devices and allow media in WhatsApp to be visible ， in other apps like the Google Photos gallery. WhatsApp doesnat assume ， that clearing the chat means clearing the media files as well. While ， the behavior might change in the future , we currently donat have any ， plans to do so. ， The vendor also noted that on Windows Phone , there is a setting that ， stops the application from saving media files that are received by the ， user. ， It is recommended that users regularly check the folders listed above ， on the SD card and empty them as needed. For those users who desire ， higher security , it may be prudent to reformat or encrypt the SD card ,  ， or destroy the SD card if needed in order to delete these files. ， REFERENCES ， CVE ID : CVE-2017-8769 ， CWE IDs : CWE-359 ( aExposure of Private Informationa )  ， Facebook security reference # 10101277738643365 ， CREDITS ， Advisory written by Yakov Shafranovich. ， TIMELINE ， 2017-04-09 : Initial report to Facebook ， 2017-04-14 : Email exchange with the vendor ， 2017-04-20 : Email exchange with the vendor ， 2017-04-03 : Email exchange with the vendor ， 2017-05-09 : Email exchange with the vendor ， 2017-05-16 : Email exchange with the vendor ， 2017-05-17 : Email exchange with the vendor ， 2017-05-17 : Public disclosure",
