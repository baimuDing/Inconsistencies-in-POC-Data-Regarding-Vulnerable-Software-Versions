    "text": "vul_name : XSS in PBLang 4.65 Profile.php/UCP.php ， vul_cve : CVE-2005-3919 ， vul_poc :  ， Who's got the magic stick? It sure as hell ain't ， 50 Cent. ， Excuse me for posting again ( within minutes ) but I did not properly check the other forms. ， In UCP.php , when editing your profile , in several fields you can inject code into the page , just as in the SendPm.php. ， EX : Input table : \"URL\" ， ' ;  ! -\"<script>alert ( String.fromCharCode ( 88 , 83 , 83 )  ; </script> ， The reason we cannot just do alert ( \"sometext\" )  ; here is because this time our input is filtered and the quotes have 's before them ( single or not ) . ， All field areas ( besides password ) are useable. I could not try alias as the board would not allow me to do so. ， Even the email field is vulnerable , so long as you put an email first ( like dude ( at ) what ( dot ) com [ email concealed ] ' ;  ! -\"<mycode> ) . ， In \"User Options\" , signature or 'saying' are not vulnerable , but URL Avatar is. ， Again ,  ， comments - suggestions - questions - flames - r0xes at 7NA dot org",
