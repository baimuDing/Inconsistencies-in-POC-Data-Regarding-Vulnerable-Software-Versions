It was later discovered by Florian Zumbiehl and Joerg ， Wittenberger that select (  ) was still being used in three other places. ， This bug is remotelye xploitable in networking code , under the right ， conditions ( if the \"ulimit -n\" value exceeds FD_SETSIZE ) . ， The announcement can be found at ， There are two commits which together fix the bug :  ， Cheers ,  ， Peter Bex",
