Sun first released a patch for this ， vulnerability on June 28th for Java Runtime Environment 5 , as Update 12. ， Now over a week later Sun has finally released the rest of the Java 6 ， updates for affected systems. People have potentially had over a week to ， develop exploits for this vulnerability before Sun finally released a ， patch for Java 6 , which is the current download of Java. eEye strongly ， recommends people install this patch as soon as possible. Hopefully in ， the future Sun will be able to bring their security and development ， process out of the dark ages. -Marc Maiffret ]  ， eEye Digital Security has discovered a stack buffer overflow in Java ， WebStart , a utility installed with Java Runtime Environment for the ， purpose of managing the download of Java applications. By opening a ， malicious JNLP file , a user's system may be compromised by arbitrary ， code within the file , which executes with the privileges of that user. ， A web-based attack conducted through Internet Explorer may succeed ， without the use of ActiveX or scripting , and without any additional user ， interaction other than viewing a web page , if the web server indicates a ， Content-Type of \"application/x-java-jnlp-file\" when serving up the ， malicious JNLP file. In such a case , a \".jnlp\" file extension is not ， required. ， Technical Details :  ， javaws.exe is responsible for extracting download instructions from JNLP ， files , which are essentially XML. The jnlp element in the JNLP file ， contains a codebase attribute. This attribute is later copied ( via ， sprintf ) into a 1K buffer , where is it also prepended with the path to ， the user's temp directory. As there is no length validation imposed ， prior to sprintf , the stack-based buffer can be overflowed by whatever ， is passed into the codebase. The one restriction placed on the input is ， that any multi-byte characters are converted into a single '0xFF' , so ， only characters 0x01 through 0x7F are permissible. ， To work around this vulnerability , if you are not actively using Java ， WebStart , remove the .jnlp content type association in your registry :  ， - HKLM : SoftwareClasses.jnlp ， - HKLM : SoftwareClassesJNLPfile ， - HKLM : SoftwareClassesMIMEDatabaseContent ， Typeapplication/x-java-jnlp-file ， By deleting or mutilating these registry keys , Java WebStart will no ， longer be used to open .jnlp files , thereby mitigation this ， vulnerability. ， Protection :  ， Retina - Network Security Scanner has been updated to identify this ， vulnerability. ， Blink - Unified Client Security has proactively protected from this ， vulnerability since its discovery. ， Vendor Status :  ， Sun Microsystems has released a patch for this vulnerability. ， JRE 5 Update 12 is available at :  ， JRE 6 Update 2 is available at :  ， Credit :  ， Daniel Soeder ， Related Links :  ， Retina - Network Security Scanner - Free Trial :  ， Blink - Unified Client Security Personal - Free For Home Use :  ， Blink - Unified Client Security Professional - Free Trial :  ， Greetings :  ， Derek for his heap clutter and counting idea.
