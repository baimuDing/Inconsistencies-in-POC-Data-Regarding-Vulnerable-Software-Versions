Nonetheless , if you use the Tatsu Builder plugin , we strongly recommend updating to the latest version available , which is 3.3.13 at the time of this writing. Please note that version 3.3.12 contained a partial patch but did not fully address all issues. ， If you know anyone using the Tatsu Builder plugin on their site , we urge you to forward this article to them as this is a large-scale attack and any vulnerable sites that are not updated and not using some form of a Web Application Firewall are at risk of complete site takeover. ， If you believe your site has been compromised as a result of this vulnerability or any other vulnerability , we offer Incident Response services via Wordfence Care. If you need your site cleaned immediately , Wordfence Response offers the same service with 24/7/365 availability and a 1-hour response time.
