    "text": "vul_name : file upload widgets in IE and Firefox have issues ， vul_cve : CVE-2006-2894 , CVE-2006-2900 ， vul_poc : -BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE- ， Hash : SHA1 ， Hey all ,  ， aside from the new file upload vulnerability in Firefox 1.5.0.3 and ， below , I discovered two others a year ago ( one in IE , the other in ， Firefox ) in the same component. I'm a little obsessed with the file ， input widget. ， Since then i've managed to lose my email , but the response I got back ， from Microsoft was basically ， \"Thank you , we'll put it in IE 7. ， p.s. you might want to check in with firefox , i think someone reported ， this a few years ago and they were vulnerable too. ， kthxbye\" ， The problem is that in both IE and Firefox you can filter the keystrokes ， entered in a form and 'bounce' the input over to the file input box , and ， then bounce back to previous text entry , making it appear as if nothing ， has happened. Yes this is minor , but a conceivable avenue of attack. ， Anyways , my bug ( No. 290478 ) to firefox was marked a dupe of a bug that ， dated back to 2000 ( No. 56236 ) . This stuff is publicly ， documented/available , but you have to know what your looking for. ， Hidden in plain site you could say.",
