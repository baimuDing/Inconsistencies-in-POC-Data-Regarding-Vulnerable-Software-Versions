The code execution can be triggered by ， interpolation of file names maliciously crafted as lookup plugin commands, in ， combination with its pipe feature. ， The second vulnerability concerns the unsafe parsing of action arguments in ， the face of an attacker controlling variable data (whether fact data, ， with_fileglob data, or other sources), allowing an attacker to supply their ， own options to an action. The impact of this is dependent on the action ， module the attacker targets. For example, an attacker controlling variables ， passed to the copy or template actions would be able to trigger arbitrary ， code execution (in addition to simple information leakage) via the validate ， option's acceptance of arbitrary shell code. ， Affected version: ， Ansible <= 1.6.6 ， Fixed version: ， Ansible >= 1.6.7 ， Credit: vulnerability report received from Brian Harring <ferringb AT ， gmail.com>. ， CVE: CVE-2014-4966 (lookup function), CVE-2014-4967 (action arguments)"
