BACKGROUND ， RealPlayer is an application for playing various media formats ,  ， developed by RealNetworks Inc. For more information , visit ， II. DESCRIPTION ， Remote exploitation of a format string vulnerability in RealPix ( .rp )  ， file format parser within various versions of RealNetworks Inc.'s ， RealPlayer could allow attackers to execute arbitrary code. ， The vulnerability specifically exists because of the improper usage of a ， formatted printing function. When a user specifies an invalid value for ， the \"timeformat\" attribute describing a RealPix file , the data is passed ， to the function. ， The following stripped down .rp file is sufficient enough to trigger the ， vulnerability :  ， <imfl> ， <head ， title=\"iDEFENSE Labs RealPix Vulnerability\" ， timeformat=\"%n%n%n%n%n%n\"/> ， </imfl> ， III. ANALYSIS ， Exploitation allows for arbitrary code execution as the user who opened ， the .rp file. ， Exploitation requires an attacker to craft a malicious .rp file and ， convince a user to open it. An attacker could also trick a user to load ， the .rp file from a normal web page under the attacker's control ; this ， is possible if the user has configured their web browser to handle ， RealPlayer formats automatically. ， IV.
