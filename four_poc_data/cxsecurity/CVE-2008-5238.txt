The worst of these vulnerabilities results in ， arbitrary code execution and the least , in unexpected process ， termination. ， Five heap buffer overflows exist in parsing of real audio files , id3 ， tags , qt mov files , and matroska headers which all can result in ， arbitrary code execution. ， Three additional heap buffer overflows occur in mng , mod , and real ， handling which are potentially exploitable. ， Seven additional issues were identified in the input plugins as well as ， the real , qt , and matroska demuxers which result in process termination ， or memory corruption that may have wider implications. ， The oCERT team was contacted by the Xine project requesting a review of ， some code changes relating to memory allocations. These vulnerabilities ， were the findings of this requested analysis. The full analysis text can ， be found in the references below. ， Affected version :  ， xine-lib <= 1.1.14 ， Fixed version :  ， xine-lib >= 1.1.15 [  *  ]  ，  * - see analysis text for more detail on fixes ， Credit : Will Drewry , oCERT Team | Google Security Team. ， CVE : TBD",
