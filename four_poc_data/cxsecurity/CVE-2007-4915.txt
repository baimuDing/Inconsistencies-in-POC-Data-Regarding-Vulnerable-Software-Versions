That means that , unlike traditional web servers , it does not fork for each incoming connection , nor does it fork many copies of itself to handle multiple connections. ， Boa is very low on hardware usage and is therefore used on many embedded systems , including routers , wireless access points and portable devices. ， The Intersil isl3893 is an arm9 System On Chip for wireless access points. The goal of the project is to make an embedded distribution built around uclibc and uclinux. ， It is possible to overwrite the \"admin\" password in memory , thus allowing an attacker to gain access to the web interface and alter configuration parameters. This vulnerability can be combined with another known vulnerability ( CVE-2000-0920 ) to read arbitrary files from the device filesystem. ， It's important to notice that Boa httpd doesn't have any authentication code built in ; the flaw is inside the Intersil extensions but we can't confirm it because no source code is released. ， VULNERABILITY DETAILS ， When asked for HTTP basic authentication credentials , it is possible to fill up the stack memory of the boa process passing a string longer than 127 characters as username. In that situation the string passed as password will overwrite the current in memory value of the admin password , thus enabling the attacker to reset it to a known value. Once reset the password , the attacker has of course access to the configuration panel. ， As an example , the password can be set to \"owned\" sending the following request to the web server :  ， GET / HTTP/1.1 ， Host : 192.168.0.1 ， Authorization : Basic YWFhYWFhYWFhYWFhYWFhYWFhYWFhYWFhYWFhYWFhYWFhYWFhYWFhYWFhYWFhYWFhYWFhYWFh ， YWFhYWFhYWFhYWFhYWFhYWFhYWFhYWFhYWFhYWFhYWFhYWFhYWFhYWFhYWFhYWFhYWFhYWFh ， YWFhYWFhYWFhYWFhYWFhYWFhYTpvd25lZA= ， The basic authorization header parameter contains the base64/mime encoded string \"aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa ， aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa : owned\" ， EXPLOIT ， The vulnerability can exploited through simple HTTP request , i.e. using a common web browser ( using the authentication credential specified above ) .",
