It is also possible to redirect users to ， third-party sites and obtain the webroot path by not submitting required ， parameters to certain scripts. ， Note: tested on Spyce - Python Server Pages version 2.1.3 ， The following are only some examples that demonstrate XSS: ， 20Cross%20Site%20Attack')%3C/SCRIPT%3E&type=internal ， an%20Cross%20Site%20Attack')</SCRIPT> ， 20Cross%20Site%20Attack')</SCRIPT> ， 20Cross%20Site%20Attack')</SCRIPT> ， oss%20Site%20Attack')</SCRIPT>&foo=Submit!&mycheck=check1&mypass=secret& ， myradio=radio_option1&mytext=some&mytextarea=</textarea><SCRIPT>alert('C ， an%20Cross%20Site%20Attack')</SCRIPT> ， lert(1)%3C/script%3E ， Other vulnerable scripts and unsanitized parameters: ， Script: /demos/chat/ ， parameter: newline ， Script: /docs/examples/formintro.spy ， parameter: text1 ， Script: /docs/examples/formtag.spy ， parameter: mytext ， parameter: mydate ， Script: /docs/examples/redirect.spy ， parameter: type ， Note: some XSS can only be exploited via POST requests (as opposed to ， GET). This could be done by using an embedded HTML form with ， \"method='POST'\" attribute and a JavaScript snippet that causes the form ， to auto-submits itself. Such form would be located on a third-party site. ， Cross-domain redirect PoC: ， e=external ， Requesting the following URL returns the server's webroot: ， Consequences: ， An attacker may be able to cause execution of malicious scripting code ， in the browser of a user who clicks on a link to a Spyce-based site. ， Such code would run within the security context of the target domain. ， This type of attack can result in non-persistent defacement of the ， target site, or the redirection of confidential information (i.e.: ， session IDs) to unauthorised third parties. ， Attackers can redirect victim users to third-party sites. Such behaviour ， can help attackers perform phishing attacks by redirecting the victim to ， a spoof login page. ， Fix: ， Remove sample scripts from live environments."
