    "text": "vul_name : Fizzle : Firefox Extension Vulnerability ， vul_cve : CVE-2007-1678 ， vul_poc : Fizzle allows feeds to use HTML in feed data resulting in JavaScript being ， run in the chrome : window with chrome permissions. The extension will ， convert HTML entities back to their ASCII equivalents thus < becomes < ， and so forth. Various feeds fields are vulnerable including the title which ， allows the code to execute when Fizzle is opened and no need for the feed ， to be viewed. ， The author Andy Frank was notified about the issue on 01/29/2007 we ， corresponded on the issue and I even offered to create a patch which I did. ， The patch did not meet his liking since the sanitation was too strict and ， made some feeds who use certain tags like <p> for formatting to lose their ， layout I told him it would be too difficult to sanitize the data unless its ， strict because so many attack variations could be used , and best thing to ， do is not allow HTML at all in the feed. On 02/20/2007 we ended discussions ， on this and I notified addons.mozilla.org about the problem and the ， developers lack of concern in fixing the extension or at least disabling ， its download so people would not download the extension. Well Mozilla ， didn't bother to remove it and have chosen to remove the extension in a ， future date when addons.mozilla.org is updated. Since then over 2 , 000+ ， users have additionally downloaded the extension , invoking me to go ， full-disclosure about it. ， Fizzle 0.5 ( previous versions likely vulnerable as well )  ， Below is the example I have tested out using version 0.5 and under nightly ， Firefox. Please note that the HTML entities must be present for the exploit ， to work. Place the below in your feed body and subscribe to the feed. View ， the feed in Fizzle. When testing make sure you clear the Fizzle cache in ， the fizzle folder under the Firefox profile. ， An attacker can check if a feed subscriber has Fizzle because Fizzle's HTTP ， request sends a custom user-agent which has the word 'Fizzle' in it. ， Detecting that keyword an attacker can serve a malicious copy of the feed ， instead.",
