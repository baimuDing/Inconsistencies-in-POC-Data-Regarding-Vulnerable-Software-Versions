Both bugs on the gnome bugtracker are ， currently private and should be made public now. The two attached ， patches are based off the 2.9.3 libxml2 release. ， A couple of weeks back while working on a related bug [ CVE-2016-3627 ] I ， discovered a specially created xml file is capable of triggering a stack ， overflow before libxml2 can detect its a invalid xml file. ， We raised this issue upstream on 2016-04-18 and informed them that we ， would place a two week embargo on the issue in case we didn't here back. ， As of yet we have had no response so we have posted here. ， We intend to keep the current embargo ( ending May 3 ) unless we get ， advise otherwise here. Below is a script to generate the xml file along ， with a tested patch to fix the issue. I will also include our ， unpublished patch and simplified reproducer for CVE-2016-3627 as again ， we have had no response upstream and its likely that you will want to ， fix this less severe issue at the same time. ， python3 repoducer.py ; xmllint repo.xml ， repoducer.py ，  #  ! /bin/python3 ， f = open ( 'repo.xml' , 'w' ) ",
