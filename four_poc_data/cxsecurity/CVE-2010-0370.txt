( From :  ， The Node Blocks module allows users to specify content type ( s ) as ， being a block. This allows the content managers of the site to edit ， the block text and title without having to access the block ， administration page. ( From :  ， The block title is not properly sanitized when a user displays a block ， created from a node , resulting in a cross site scripting ， vulnerability. ， Systems affected :  ， This has been confirmed in Node Blocks 6.x-1.3 and 5.x-1.1. Previous ， versions may also be affected. ， Impact :  ， This is an example of a stored cross site scripting vulnerability. ， Stored attacks are those where the injected code is permanently stored ， on the target servers , such as in a database , in a message forum ,  ， visitor log , comment field , etc. The victim then retrieves the ， malicious script from the server when it requests the stored ， information. ( From OWASP :  ， Mitigating factors :  ， A user must be able to create nodes of a type used by Node Blocks , and ， this node must be added as a block by a user with the administer ， blocks permission.",
