Also , quotation marks are escaped properly. ， An attacker can use the behavior to construct a malicious string , which will ， embed persistent cross-site scripting within the transfer comments. The ， exploit will be executed when viewing the transfer comments. ， For a user not registered within the file transfer appliance , the ， exploit will ， be executed directly when opening the provided transfer URL. ， This vulnerability is also discovered at the global notice board where ， no escaping could be identified. ， Proof of Concept ( PoC )  :  ， The following string will result in persistent cross-site scripting ， displaying the message \"Persistent XSS by SySS GmbH\" when executed. All an ， attacker needs to do is to enter the malicious string as a comment to a ， transfer. ， \">img src=x ， onerror=alert ( String.fromCharCode ( 80 , 101 , 114 , 115 , 105 , 115 , 116 , 101 ,  ， 110 , 116 , 32 , 88 , 83 , 83 , 32 , 98 , 121 , 32 , 83 , 121 , 83 , 83 , 32 , 71 , 109 , 98 , 72 ) /<\"",
