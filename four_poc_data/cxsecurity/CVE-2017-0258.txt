    "text": "vul_name : Windows 7 Uninitialized Memory in the Default dacl Descriptor of System Processes Token ， vul_cve : CVE-2017-0258 ， vul_poc : / *  ， We have observed ( on Windows 7 32-bit ) that for unclear reasons , the kernel-mode structure containing the default DACL of system processes' tokens ( lsass.exe , services.exe , . ) has 8 uninitialized bytes at the end , as the size of the structure ( ACL.AclSize ) is larger than the sum of ACE lengths ( ACE_HEADER.AceSize ) . It is possible to read the leftover pool data using a GetTokenInformation ( TokenDefaultDacl ) call. ， When the attached proof-of-concept code is run against a SYSTEM process ( pid of the process must be passed in the program argument )  , on a system with Special Pools enabled for ntoskrnl.exe , output similar to the following can be observed :  ， >NtQueryInformationToken.exe 520 ， 00000000 : 54 bf 2b 00 02 00 3c 00 02 00 00 00 00 00 14 00 T.+.<. ， 00000010 : 00 00 00 10 01 01 00 00 00 00 00 05 12 00 00 00 . ， 00000020 : 00 00 18 00 00 00 02 a0 01 02 00 00 00 00 00 05 . ， 00000030 : 20 00 00 00 20 02 00 00 [ 01 01 01 01 01 01 01 01 ] . . ， The last eight 0x01 bytes are markers inserted by Special Pools , which visibly haven't been overwritten by any actual data prior to being returned to user-mode.",
