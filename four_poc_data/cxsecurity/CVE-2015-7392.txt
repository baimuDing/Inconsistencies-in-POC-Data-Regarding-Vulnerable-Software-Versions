Advisory Information ， Title : Heap overflow in freeswitch json parser < 1.6.2 & < 1.4.23 ， Submitter : Marcello Duarte ( marcello @ cybersightgroup.com )  ， Product : freeswitch ， Product URL :  ， Affected Versions : freeswitch < 1.6.2 & < 1.4.23 ， Fixed Versions : 1.6.2 , 1.4.23 ， Link to source code diff :  ， CVE Status : CVE-2015-7392 ， 2. Vulnerability Information ， Impact : Code execution ， Remotely Exploitable : Yes ， Locally Exploitable : No ， 3. Vulnerability Description ， Product Information : FreeSWITCH is a scalable open source ， cross-platform telephony platform designed to route and interconnect ， popular communication protocols using audio , video , text or any other ， form of media. It was created in 2006 to fill the void left by ， proprietary commercial solutions. FreeSWITCH also provides a stable ， telephony platform on which many applications can be developed using a ， wide range of free tools. ， Vulnerability :  ， A carefully crafted json string supplied to cJSON_Parse will trigger a ， heap overflow with user controlled data. ， The underlying vulnerability occurs in the parse_string function. ， By passing a json string with \\u at the end of the string will cause ， the parser to increment past the null at the end of string. ， This confuses the code responsible for copying the string. Since it ， doesn't detect the NULL in this situation , it will keep copying until ， it hits a null in memory. This leads to a heap overflow with user ， controlled data. ， Any modules or core code which allows user supplied json to enter the ， json parser will be vulnerable.",
