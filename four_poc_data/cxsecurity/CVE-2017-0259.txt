    "text": "vul_name : Windows 10 Kernel nt ! NtTraceControl ( EtwpSetProviderTraits ) Pool Memory Disclosure ， vul_cve : CVE-2017-0259 ， vul_poc : / *  ， We have discovered that the handler of the nt ! NtTraceControl system call ( specifically the EtwpSetProviderTraitsUm functionality , opcode 0x1E ) discloses portions of uninitialized pool memory to user-mode clients on Windows 10 systems. ， On our test Windows 10 32-bit workstation , an example layout of the output buffer is as follows :  ， - cut - ， 00000000 : 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 . ， 00000010 : 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff . ， 00000020 : ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff . ， 00000030 : ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff . ， 00000040 : ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 . ， 00000050 : 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 . ， 00000060 : 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff . ， 00000070 : ff ff ff ff 00 00 00 00 ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? . ， - cut - ， Where 00 denote bytes which are properly initialized , while ff indicate uninitialized values copied back to user-mode. ， The issue can be reproduced by running the attached proof-of-concept program on a system with the Special Pools mechanism enabled for ntoskrnl.exe. Then , it is clearly visible that bytes at the aforementioned offsets are equal to the markers inserted by Special Pools , and would otherwise contain leftover data that was previously stored in that memory region ( in this case , the special byte is 0x75 , or \"u\" )  :  ， - cut - ， 00000000 : 28 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 24 f8 f7 00 00 00 00 00 ( . $ . ， 00000010 : 39 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 75 75 75 75 75 75 75 75 9.uuuuuuuu ， 00000020 : 75 75 75 75 75 75 75 75 75 75 75 75 75 75 75 75 uuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu ， 00000030 : 75 75 75 75 75 75 75 75 75 75 75 75 75 75 75 75 uuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu ， 00000040 : 75 75 75 75 75 75 75 75 01 00 00 00 ff 00 00 00 uuuuuuuu. ， 00000050 : a1 03 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 80 00 00 . ， 00000060 : 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 75 75 75 75 75 75 75 75 .uuuuuuuu ， 00000070 : 75 75 75 75 00 00 00 00 ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? uuuu. ， - cut - ， Repeatedly triggering the vulnerability could allow local authenticated attackers to defeat certain exploit mitigations ( kernel ASLR ) or read other secrets stored in the kernel address space.",
