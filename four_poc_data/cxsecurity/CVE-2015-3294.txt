This may lead , upon successful ， exploitation , to reading the heap memory of dnsmasq. ， In more detail :  ， Function tcp_request (  ) calls setup_reply (  ) and the returned value is used as ， a size argument in a write function. ， m = setup_reply ( header ,  ( unsigned int ) size , addrp , flags ,  ， daemon->local_ttl )  ;  ， read_write ( confd , packet , m + sizeof ( u16 )  , 0 )  ;  ， The m variable is determined by a subtraction between the ， The return value of skip_question doesn't checked for error ( NULL ) . ， As a result the negative value of pointer ( -header )  , might returned. ， size_t setup_reply ( struct dns_header * header , size_t qlen ,  ， struct all_addr * addrp , unsigned int flags , unsigned long ttl )  ， { ， unsigned char * p = skip_questions ( header , qlen )  ， } ， read_write checks if the size argument is positive. In case of a 32 bit ， system ， size_t m would be 4 bytes and read_write will automatically exit. In case of ， 64 ， bit system size_t m is 8 bytes and may turn to positive if the sign bit of ， the ， 32 bit value is 0. ， If m is less than 0xffffffff80000000 , dnsmasq will be exploited by a ， potential attacker who will remotely read dnsmasq heap. If the above ， condition is not met , dnsmasq exits properly. ， Researcher ， Nick Sampanis ( n.sampanis [ a t ] obrela [ do t ] com )  ， Vulnerability ， Unchecked return value CVE-2015-3294 ， Identification date :  ， 07/04/2015 - 09/04/2015 ， Solution - fix & patch ， Please download dnsmasq-2.73rc4.tar.gz",
