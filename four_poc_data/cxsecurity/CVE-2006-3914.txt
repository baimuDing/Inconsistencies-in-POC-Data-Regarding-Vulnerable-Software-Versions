Affected Software ， Blackboard Academic Suite 6.2.3.23 ， Prior or newer versions may also be affected. ， Vendor website :  ， II. Impact ， Subjective : Severe ， Objective : Privilege escalation ， III. Vulnerability ， There is a persistent/stored/second-order cross-site scripting ， vulnerability within the testing functionality of Blackboard ， Academic Suite 6.2.23. The vulnerability can be used by attackers ， who have unprivileged user accounts to escalate their privileges ， within one or more Blackboard courses , or , with luck , gain system- ， wide Blackboard administrative privileges. Privilege escalation is ， possible by using the vulnerability to steal \"session_id\" cookies ， from users whose accounts have higher privileges than the ， attacker's account. An additional attack opportunity may exist if ， an attacker has identified a remotely-exploitable vulnerability in ， the javascript interpreter of the target user's web browser. ， Blackboard Academic Suite 6.2.23 attempts to defend against this ， vulnerability by using client-side javascript to remove any ， javascript code entered into test questions. Trusting the client ， to validate input is a bad idea. In this case , the attacker can ， defeat the validation routine by simply disabling javascript in ， his/her web browser. ， To exploit the vulnerability when using Mozilla Firefox to access a ， Blackboard Academic Suite 6.2.3.23 system :  ， 1. As a user with the course instructor role , create a test in any ， course and add an essay question to the test. Deploy the test in a ， course area that is available to students in the course. ， 2.

Turn off javascript in Firefox. ， 4. Navigate to and click the link for the test created in step 1. ， Begin the test. ， 5. The essay question created in step 1 should appear. Click the ， \"HTML\" radio button below the question's response box. Enter ， javascript code into the response box. Submit the test attempt. ， 6. Logout. ， 7. Turn on javascript in Firefox. ， 8. Login as the course instructor. ， 9. Access the course selected in step one. In the course's control ， panel , click \"Gradebook\" , then click the name of the test created ， in step one , and then click \"View Attempt Details\". ， 10. Find that the javascript code entered in step 5 is executed in ， the target?s browser in the security context of the Blackboard ， website being accessed. ， IV.
