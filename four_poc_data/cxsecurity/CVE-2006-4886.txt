    "text": "vul_name : McAfee VirusScan Enterprise - disabling the client side \"On-Access Scan\" ， vul_cve : CVE-2006-4886 ， vul_poc : Suggested Risk Level : Low ， Type of Risk : Disabling security component. ， Affected Software : VirusScan Enterprise 7.1.0 ( client side , managed ， centrally by ePolicy Orchestrator )  , Scan Engine : 4.4.00 , the \"VirusScan ， On-Access Scan\" component. ， OS Environment : Windows 2000 workstation w/SP4 and all the up-to-date ， windows update security and operational patches ( May be valid on Windows XP ， as well , but was not tested on XP ) . ， Local / Remote activated : Local. ， Summary :  ， A McAfee administrator can choose to prevent a local user of the VirusScan ， client to disable the \"On-Access Scan\" ( the real-time memory virus ， monitoring and cleaning component ) by making the \"disable\" button un-active ， within the \"VirusScan On-Access Scan Statistics\" dialog box. ， But , just after a user logs on locally to the desktop , and after any period ， of time , until the first time the \"VirusScan On-Access Scan Statistics\" ， dialog box is opened ? the user can double click the \"VirusScan On-Access ， Scan\" icon on the task bar and then the \"disable\" button will be active for ， about 5 seconds , a sufficient time for the user to press the this button. ， After pressing the \"disable\" button , the button will change its interface ， text to \"enable\" , the \"On-Access Scan\" icon will present a \"no entrance\" ， sign , stating it is disabled , and the \"Network Associates McShield\" service ， will be in a \"paused\" mode. ， Once the 5 seconds period has passed ? the button will become disabled ，  ( grayed out ) in whatever state it is at that time , stabilizing the ， \"On-Access Scan\" component to its last state , which is one of two :  ， 1. The button was not pressed -> Button shows \"disable\" ; the \"On-Access ， Scan\" is active and the \"Network Associates McShield\" service will be in a ， \"started\" mode. ， 2. The button was pressed -> Button shows \"enable\" ; the \"On-Access Scan\" is ， disabled and the \"Network Associates McShield\" service will be in a \"paused\" ， mode. ， I rated this issue as \"low\" because it is mostly an interface related issue ,  ， and the user must be a member of a local users group that can pause a ， service , i.e. \"power users\" or \"Administrators\" , which are the most ， privileged users groups in the OS. ， This issue is relevant only in a cases where the OS , particularly the ， interface , was heavily hardened ( especially preventing access to the ， \"services\" console and preventing running any command line interface )  , but ， the user has access to the \"VirusScan On-Access Scan Statistics\" dialog box ， and is a member of the \"power users\" or \"Administrators\" groups. ， Possible Abuses : Disabling the VirusScan real-time virus protection ,  ， exposing the OS to virus infection.",
