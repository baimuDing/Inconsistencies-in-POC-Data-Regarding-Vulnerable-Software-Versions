A patched version of the plugin , 9.1.1 , was released on April 21 , 2022. ， We released a firewall rule to protect Wordfence Premium , Wordfence Care , and Wordfence Response customers on April 18 , 2022. Sites still running the free version of Wordfence will receive the same protection on May 18 , 2022. ， We recommend that all Wordfence users update to the patched version , 9.1.1 , as soon as possible as this will entirely eliminate the vulnerability. ， Description : Insecure Deserialization/PHP Object Injection ， Affected Plugin : Booking Calendar ， Plugin Slug : booking ， Plugin Developer : wpdevelop , oplugins ， Affected Versions : <= 9.1 ， CVE ID : CVE-2022-1463 ， CVSS Score : 8.1 ( High )  ， CVSS Vector : CVSS : 3.1/AV : N/AC : H/PR : N/UI : N/S : U/C : H/I : H/A : H ， Researcher/s : Ramuel Gall ， Fully Patched Version : 9.1.1 ， The Booking Calendar plugin allows site owners to add a booking system to their site , which includes the ability to publish a flexible timeline showing existing bookings and openings using a shortcode ,  [ bookingflextimeline ] . ， The flexible timeline includes the ability to configure viewing preferences and options when viewing the published timeline. Some of these options were passed in PHPs serialized data format , and unserialized by the define_request_view_params_from_params function in core/timeline/v2/wpbc-class-timeline_v2.php. ， An attacker could control the serialized data via several methods :  ， - If a timeline was published , an unauthenticated attacker could obtain the nonce required to send an AJAX request with the action set to WPBC_FLEXTIMELINE_NAV and a timeline_obj [ options ] parameter set to a serialized PHP object. ， - Any authenticated attacker could use the built-in parse-media-shortcode AJAX action to execute the [ bookingflextimeline ] shortcode , adding an options attribute in the shortcode set to a serialized PHP object. This would work even on sites without a published timeline. ， - An attacker with contributor-level privileges or above could also embed the [ bookingflextimeline ] shortcode containing a malicious options attribute into a post and execute it by previewing it , or obtain the WPBC_FLEXTIMELINE_NAV nonce by previewing the [ bookingflextimeline ] shortcode and then using method # 1.",
