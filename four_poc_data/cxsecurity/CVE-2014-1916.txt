Vulnerability ， A malformed Opus voice packet sent to a MumbleKit ， client ( such as Mumble for iOS ) could trigger a ， NULL pointer dereference. This causes a client ， crash ( Denial of Service ) . ， This can be triggered remotely by an entity ， participating in a Mumble voice chat. ， 2. Affected versions and configurations ， All versions of MumbleKit with Opus support are ， affected unless they include the fix for this ， issue , which is available in the MumbleKit Git ， repository as commit ， fd190328a9b24d37382b269a5674b0c0c7a7e36d. ， Mumble for iOS version 1.1 through 1.2.2 are ， vulnerable , as they use vulnerable versions ， of MumbleKit. ， 3. Mitigation ， No known mitigation strategy for this issue exists. ， Version 1.2.3 and prior of Mumble's server component ，  ( 'Murmur' or 'mumble-server' ) does not allow the ， transmission of Opus packets , and as such a vulnerable ， client connected to a stock Murmur server that runs ， version 1.2.3 or prior should not be affected by this ， issue. ， Note however that since Mumble is a centralized VoIP ， system , a modified server could potentially also ， trigger malformed Opus packets to be sent to clients ， of its choosing , thus triggering this issue. ， 4. Details ， Mumble's Opus voice packets are serialized as a buffer ， with a length-prefix using Mumble's internal ， PacketDataStream serialization format. ， MumbleKit failed to properly validate the length prefix ， of received Opus voice packets. ， If an Opus packet with an invalid length prefix was ， received , MumbleKit would attempt to extract it using ， an MKPacketDataStream object's copyDataBlock : method. ， When the copyDataBlock : method is successful , it returns ， a valid NSData object. When an error occurs , it instead ， returns nil , and sets an error flag in the ， MKPacketDataStream object ( which can be queired using the ， 'valid' method. )  ， Instead of performing proper error checking , MumbleKit ， used the returned NSData object as-is , without first ， checking whether it was nil , or whether the ， MKPacketDataStream object had its error flag set. ， When the returned NSData object is nil , MumbleKit calls ， the Opus functions opus_packet_get_nb_frames (  ) and ， opus_packet_get_samples_per_frame (  ) with a NULL pointer ， as the packet buffer. This causes the functions to ， dereference the NULL pointer. ， 5. Credits ， This issue was discovered by the Mumble team after a ， reproducible crash that happened when transmitting ， audio was reported by Wesley Wolfe on January 25 , 2014. ， 6. Fix ， A fix for this issue has beeen released in Mumble for iOS 1.2.3. ， Other users of MumbleKit should make sure they are using a ， version of MumbleKit that includes the fixed commit , which is ， fd190328a9b24d37382b269a5674b0c0c7a7e36d. ， 0",
