The entropy in the session ， token comes solely from the system time when the real manager logs in ， with a granularity of one second. This can be exploited to ， impersonate a currently logged on manager by brute forcing the ， authentication token. ， Successful exploitation further allows execution of arbitrary code ， via manipulation of the configuration. ， 5 ) Solution ， The vendor has issued patches for Trend Micro OfficeScan 8.0 and ， Worry-Free Business Security 5.0. ， Fixes for other affected versions should be available shortly. ， 6 ) Time Table ， 12/08/2008 - Vendor notified. ， 12/08/2008 - Vendor response. ， 16/08/2008 - Vendor provides status update. ， 22/08/2008 - Vendor issues patches for some of the affected products. ， 22/08/2008 - Public disclosure. ， 7 ) Credits ， Discovered by Dyon Balding , Secunia Research. ， 8 )  ， The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures ( CVE ) project has assigned ， CVE-2008-2433 for the vulnerability. ， 9 ) About Secunia ， Secunia offers vulnerability management solutions to corporate ， customers with verified and reliable vulnerability intelligence ， relevant to their specific system configuration :  ， Secunia also provides a publicly accessible and comprehensive advisory ， database as a service to the security community and private ， individuals , who are interested in or concerned about IT-security. ， Secunia believes that it is important to support the community and to ， do active vulnerability research in order to aid improving the ， security and reliability of software in general :  ， Secunia regularly hires new skilled team members.
