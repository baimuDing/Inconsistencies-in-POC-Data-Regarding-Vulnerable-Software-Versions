The sender would need to know a valid username. ， Currently Net-SNMP and UCD-SNMP are known to be vulnerable , other SNMP ， implementations may also be affected. The eCos project includes code derived ， from UCD-SNMP and is therefore also affected. ， Affected version :  ， Net-SNMP <= 5.4.1 , <= 5.3.2 , <= 5.2.4 ， UCD-SNMP , all versions ， eCos , all versions ， Fixed version :  ， Net-SNMP >= 5.4.1.1 , >= 5.3.2.1 , >= 5.2.4.1 ， UCD-SNMP , N/A ， eCos , N/A ， Credit : this issue was reported by CERT/CC , it is tracked as VU # 878044. ， CVE : CVE-2008-0960",
