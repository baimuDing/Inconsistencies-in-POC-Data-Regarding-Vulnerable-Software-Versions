The goal of this project is to provide a secure , efficient and extensible server that provides HTTP services in sync with the current HTTP standards. ， Apache has been the most popular web server on the Internet since April 1996. The November 2005 Netcraft Web Server Survey found that more than 70% of the web sites on the Internet are using Apache , thus making it more widely used than all other web servers combined. ， mod_proxy_balancer :  ， - From apache site : \"Balancer manager enables dynamic update of balancer members. You can use balancer manager to change the balance factor or a particular member , or put it in the off line mode\" ， balancer-manager is an administrative interface which should only be accessible to trusted users. Due to the fact the SecurityRisk is Low. ， - - 1. Apache2 Cross-Site Request Forgery ( CSRF ) Vulnerability - ， During the fact that all actions are performed by GET method there exist \"CSRF\" . ， The balancer-manager should use POST for requests which have side-effects ， which would significantly mitigate the \"CSRF\" issue. ， - - 2. Apache2 HTML Injection ( XSS ) Vulnerability - ， - - First XSS - ， The HTML Injection ( XSS ) vulnerability exist in \"mod_proxy_balancer.c\" . ， By Enabling Balancer Manager Support we can trigger XSS vulnerability . ， Input passed to the :  ， \"ss\" - called \"StickySession Identifier\" ,  ， \"wr\" - called \"Route\" ,  ， \"rr\" - called \"Route Redirect\" ,  ， parametrs in balancer-manager are not properly sanitised leading to execute arbitrary HTML and script code in a victim's browser. ， - - Second XSS - ， Input passed in the URL to \"balancer-mamanger\" is not properly sanitised leading to execute arbitrary HTML and script code in a victim's browser. ， - - 3. Apache2 Denial of Service Vulnerability - ， The Denial of Service is caused due to an error in the \"balancer_handler (  ) \" function that manages the loadfactors and member status. When attacker input invalid \"bb\" variable while editing worker settings leads to \"Denial of Service Vulnerability\". ， - - 4. Apache2 Memory Corruption - ， The Memory corruption is caused due to an error in the \"mod_proxy_balancer\" when attacker input in the URL 7390 or 7506 or 7622 \"A\" chars. ， - - 4. Exploit - ， SecurityReason is not going to release a exploit to the general public. ， Exploit was provided and tested for Apache Team . ， - - 5. How to fix - ， Update to Apache 2.2.7-dev ， - - 6. ， CSRF :  ， - - 7. Greets - ， For : Maksymilian Arciemowicz ( cXIb8O3 )  , Infospec , pi3 , p_e_a , mpp ， - - 8.
