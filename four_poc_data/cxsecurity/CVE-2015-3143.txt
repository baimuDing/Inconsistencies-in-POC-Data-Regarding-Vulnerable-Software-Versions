    "text": "vul_name : cURL libcurl 7.41.0 NTLM remote attackers connect as other users ， vul_cve : CVE-2015-3143 ， vul_poc : VULNERABILITY ， libcurl keeps a pool of its last few connections around after use to fascilitate easy , conventient and completely transparent connection re-use for applications. ， When doing HTTP requests NTLM authenticated , the entire connnection becomes authenticated and not just the specific HTTP request which is otherwise how HTTP works. This makes NTLM special and a subject for special treatment in the code. With NTLM , once the connection is authenticated , no further authentication is necessary until the connection gets closed. ， libcurl's connection re-use logic will select an existing connection for re-use when asked to do a request , and when asked to use NTLM libcurl have to pick a connection with matching credentials only. ， If a connection was first setup and used for an NTLM HTTP request with a specific set of credentials , that same connection could later wrongly get re-used in a subsequent HTTP request that was made to the same host - but without having any credentials set ! Since an NTLM connection was already authenticated due to how NTLM works , the subsequent request could then get sent over the wrong connection appearing as the initial user. ， This problem is very similar to the previous problem known as CVE-2014-0015. The main difference this time is that the subsequent request that wrongly re-use a connection doesn't ask for NTLM authentication. ， We are not aware of any exploits of this flaw. ， INFO ， This flaw can also affect the curl command line tool if a similar operation series is made with that. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures ( CVE ) project has assigned the name CVE-2015-3143 to this issue. ， AFFECTED VERSIONS ， Affected versions : from libcurl 7.10.6 to and including 7.41.0 ， Not affected versions : libcurl >= 7.42.0 ， libcurl is used by many applications , but not always advertised as such !  ， THE SOLUTION ， libcurl 7.42.0 makes sure that a connection that is re-used also have to have a matching set of credentials if it would re-use a connection already using NTLM. ， A patch for this problem is available at :  ， From d7d1bc8f08eea1a85ab0d794bc1561659462d937 Mon Sep 17 00 : 00 : 00 2001 ， From : Daniel Stenberg <daniel @ hax.se> ， Date : Thu , 16 Apr 2015 13 : 26 : 46 +0200",
