    "text": "vul_name : Avast SandBox Escape via IOCTL Requests ， vul_cve : CVE-2016-4025 ， vul_poc :  * CVE : CVE-2016-4025 ，  * Vendor : Avast ，  * Reported by : Kyriakos Economou ，  * Date of Release : 19/04/2016 ，  * Affected Products : Multiple ，  * Affected Version : Multiple ，  * Fixed Version : N/A ， Description :  ， A design flaw in Avast Sandbox allows a potentially harmful program to escape the sandbox and infect the host by ， dropping its files out of it and/or by modifying existing legitimate files of any type. ， Affected Products :  ， Avast Internet Security v11.x.x ， Avast Pro Antivirus v11.x.x ， Avast Premier v11.x.x ， Avast Free Antivirus v11.x.x ， Avast Business Security v11.x.x ， Avast Endpoint Protection v8.x.x ， Avast Endpoint Protection Plus v8.x.x ， Avast Endpoint Protection Suite v8.x.x ， Avast Endpoint Protection Suite Plus v8.x.x ， Avast File Server Security v8.x.x ， Avast Email Server Security v8.x.x ， Earlier and latest versions of these products are currently affected. ， Technical Details :  ， The Avast virtualization kernel mode driver ( aswSnx.sys ) handles specific IOCTL requests sent through the snxhk.dll ， module which is automatically loaded in the address space of all sandboxed processes. One of the features that this ， module attempts to provide , is to recognize user interaction with the GUI of the sandboxed application which ， facilitates saving a file out of the sandboxed process. For example , a user can still save a txt file out of a ， notepad.exe sandboxed process by navigating through the menu to the 'Save as' dialogue box of the application. The ， design flaw consists in the fact that there is no further authentication from the kernel driver itself with regards to ， the IOCTL requests , in order to verify that releasing a file out of the sandbox it is indeed an authorised action ， performed by the user. This vulnerability can be exploited by a malicious application in order to infect the host by ， dropping its files and/or infect existing legitimate files of any type without requiring user interaction. A ， ransomware that exploits this vulnerability will be able to encrypt all the targetted files while its process will be ， running in the sandbox. This vulnerability is critical since it totally breaks the purpose of the Sandbox protection ， and other features , such as DeepScreen , that rely on this. ， Further reading :  ， Disclosure Log :  ， Vendor Contacted : 01/11/2015 ， Request for Feedback : 23/11/2015 ， Request for Feedback : 01/04/2016 ， Public Disclosure : 19/04/2016 ， Copyright :  ， Copyright ( c ) Nettitude Limited 2016 , All rights reserved worldwide.",
