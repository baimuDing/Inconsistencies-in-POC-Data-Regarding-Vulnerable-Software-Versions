    "text": "vul_name : DotNetNuke Default Machine Key Exposure ， vul_cve : CVE-2008-6540 ， vul_poc : = ， DotNetNuke Default Machine Key Exposure ， Public Release Date : March 20 , 2008 ， Brian Holyfield - Gotham Digital Science ( labs ( at ) gdssecurity ( dot ) com [ email concealed ]  )  ， Affected Software : DotNetNuke <= 4.8.1 ， Severity : Critical ， 1. Summary ， DotNetNuke ( DNN ) is an open-source Web Application Framework used to create and deploy websites. The default web.config files distributed with DNN include an embedded Machine Key value ( both ValidationKey and DecryptionKey ) . Under certain circumstances these values may not be updated during the installation/upgrade process , resulting in the ability for an attacker to forge arbitrary ASP.NET forms authentication tickets that can then be used to circumvent all security within a DNN installation. This issue was confirmed to affect the production instance of DNN used on the DNN Homepage ( www.dotnetnuke.com ) . ， The vendor ( DotNetNuke Corporation ) was notified of this issue on March 3 , 2008. The vendor responded by releasing version 4.8.2 on March 19 , 2008 and has also issued a security bulletin (  ， abid/1148/Default.aspx ) . ， 2. Technical Details ， The default web.config files distributed with DotNetNuke ( DNN ) include the following embedded ValidationKey and DecryptionKey values :  ， <machineKey ， validationKey=\"F9D1A2D3E1D3E2F7B3D9F90FF3965ABDAC304902\" ， decryptionKey=\"F9D1A2D3E1D3E2F7B3D9F90FF3965ABDAC304902F8D923AC\" ， decryption=\"3DES\" ， validation=\"SHA1\"/> ， Normally , these values are overwritten by the web-based installation wizard during the initial website setup process. Specifically , the Config.UpdateMachineKey (  ) routine is called during the initial installation process. Under certain scenarios where the web server user account does not have access to update the web.config file during installation , the default value will fail to be updated resulting in a DNN installation that uses these values for authentication token encryption and validation. It is unclear how widespread this issue could potentially be , however it was confirmed that the production instance of DNN used on the DNN Homepage ( www.dotnetnuke.com ) was affected by this issue.",
