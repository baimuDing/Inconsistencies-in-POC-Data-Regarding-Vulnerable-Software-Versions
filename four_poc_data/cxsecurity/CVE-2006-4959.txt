INTRODUCTION ， Sun Secure Global Desktop ( SSGD , formerly known as Tarantella [ 1 ]  ) is an ， open-source remote desktop solution with a basic amount of security. ， More information is available at the official product demo web site at ， the following URL :  ， II. DESCRIPTION ， Marc Ruef at scip AG found six undisclosed web-based vulnerabilities in ， Sun Secure Global Desktop prior 4.3. These can be divided into two classes :  ， 1. Cross site scripting ， Some scripts that are not protected by any authentication procedure can ， be used to run arbitrary script code within a cross site scripting attack. ， 2. Revealing of sensitive information ， Some scripts that are not protected by any authentication procedure can ， be accessed to reveal sensitive information ( e.g. internal hostnames ,  ， applied software version , details about settings ) about the target host. ， III. EXPLOITATION ， Classic script injection techniques and unexpected input data within a ， browser session can be used to exploit these vulnerabilities. ， A plugin for the open-source exploiting framework \"Attack Tool Kit\" ，  ( ATK ) will be published in the near future. [ 2 ]  ， We are not going to publish any further technical details or an exploit ， suite due to Sun has not published any patches as far as we know. See ， vendor response and disclosure timeline for further details. ， IV. IMPACT ， Because non-authenticated parts of the software are affected , this ， vulnerabilities are serious for every secure environment. ， Non-authenticated users might be able to exploit the flaws to gain ， elevated privileges ( e.g. extracting sensitive cookie information or ， launch a buffer overflow attack against another web browser ) . ， V. DETECTION ， Detection of web based attacks requires a specialized web proxy and/or ， intrusion detection system. Patterns for such a detection are available ， and easy to implement. ， VI. SOLUTION ， We have informed sun on a very early stage. They said that the problems ， will be addressed with a bugfix for the currently shipping version 4.2 ， and will no longer be existing in the upcoming version 4.3. We were told ， that the public release for the patch is at the end of August 2006. Due ， to no public release was made and our last emails were not answered , we ， do not know what kind of official solution is available. This is why we ， are not going to publish any technical details or exploits at the ， moment. De-activate the following scripts to gain a higher level of ， security :  ， - ttaarchives.cgi ， - ttaAuthentication.jsp ， - ttalicense.cgi ， - ttawlogin.cgi ， - ttawebtop.cgi ， - ttaabout.cgi ， - test-cgi ， VII. VENDOR RESPONSE ， Sun Microsystems Inc. has been informed a first time at 07/04/2006 via ， email to contactus-at-sun.com. Because no reply came back we decided to ， send a forwarding at 07/18/2006 to security-alert-at-sun.com. A first ， response came back on the same day. Several email messages were ， exchanged to discuss the vulnerabilities and to co-ordinate the ， disclosure of this advisory. However , the last emails since 09/15/2006 ， have not been answered. ， VIII.
