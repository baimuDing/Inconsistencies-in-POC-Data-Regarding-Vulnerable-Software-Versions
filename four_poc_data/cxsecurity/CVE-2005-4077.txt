It can be installed on any ordinary PC ， or Mac. When these computers \"sleep\", the screen saver comes on and ， the computers communicate with each other by the internet to share ， the work of creating morphing abstract animations known as \"sheep.\" ， Description ， By spoofing the DNS entry for sheepserver.net or otherwise redirecting ， the Electric Sheep client to a malicious sheep server, it is possible ， to force the Electric Sheep client to download and display arbitrary ， mpegs due to a lack of authentication of the sheep server and sheep ， mpegs. At minimum, a rogue sheep server would need to respond to the ， Electric Sheep client with list.gz, a list of sheep available for ， download, and the referenced mpegs. To properly display the mpegs, they ， need to contain special footer information which can be found at the ， bottom of any pre-existing Electric Sheep mpegs. ， Electric sheep uses cURL internally for interaction with the Electric ， Sheep server. Two recent vulnerabilities in cURL can be exploited ， through malicious interaction with the Electric Sheep client. ， As in the previous vulnerability, spoofing the DNS entry of ， sheepserver.net or otherwise redirecting the Electric Sheep client ， to a malicious sheep server and replacing it with an appropriate HTTP ， 30x response can allow remote code execution through cURL due to an ， NTLM buffer overflow vulnerability [1,2]. ， Calling the Electric Sheep client by command line, configuration file, ， or otherwise with a malicious sheep server URL allows local code ， execution through cURL due to a URL buffer overflow vulnerability. ， In addition, by redirecting the Electric Sheep client to a rogue sheep ， server and supplying a list of maliciously formatted URLs it is ， possible to exploit the same cURL URL buffer overflow vulnerability ， remotely. This is possible because the Electric Sheep client makes ， direct system calls to the vulnerable cURL application from network ， supplied input [3,4]. ， Impact ， Spoofing the DNS entry for sheepserver.net or otherwise redirecting ， the Electric Sheep client to a rogue sheep server, it is possible to ， remotely control the video displayed or remotely execute code on all ， Electric Sheep clients affected by such a redirection. Local code ， execution is also possible due to a cURL vulnerability. ， Workaround ， The vendor was notified on November 18, 2005. The vendor was extremely ， responsive and cooperative in regards to these security issues. All ， issues are fixed in the CVS HEAD of Electric Sheep client development ， and will be included in the next release. ， [ 1 ] libcurl NTLM Buffer Overflow Vulnerability ， [ 2 ] CVE-2005-3185 ， [ 3 ] libcurl URL Buffer Overflow Vulnerability ， [ 4 ] CVE-2005-4077 ， About ， The Information Systems and Internet Security (ISIS) Laboratory is an ， NSF funded laboratory designed to facilitate hands-on experimentation ， and project work in issues related to information security. It provides ， the focus for multidisciplinary research and education in emerging ， areas of security. Polytechnic University, an NSA Center of Academic ， Excellence in Information Assurance Education, houses the lab. ， These vulnerabilities were discovered during coursework performed for ， \"Penetration Testing & Vulnerability Analysis\" offered at Polytechnic ， University ( during the Fall 2005 semester. ， License ， The contents of this document are licensed under the ， Creative Commons - Attribution / Share Alike license. ， Authors ， Daniel Guido dguido (at) gmail (dot) com [email concealed] ， Michael Aiello"
