I've verified that our grep 2.10 package ， segfaults on the amd64 platform with the simple reproducer: ， $ perl -e 'print \"x\"x(231)' | grep x > /dev/null ， Segmentation fault (core dumped) ， This specific problem was patched [2] with the following checkin: ， This checkin adds this text to the NEWS file: ， + grep no longer dumps core on lines whose lengths do not fit in 'int'. ， + (e.g., lines longer than 2 GiB on a typical 64-bit host). ， + Instead, grep either works as expected, or reports an error. ， + An error can occur if not enough main memory is available, or if the ， + GNU C library's regular expression functions cannot handle such long lines. ， + [bug present since \"the beginning\"] ， Please assign a CVE number for this problem. ， Several other checkins around the 2.11 timeframe also look like they ， may be security-relevant: ， PCRE over-long line fix: ， Integer overflow issues: ， Paul, are any security issues fixed with those patches? Did I overlook ， any other patches that need CVE numbers? ， Thanks ， 1: ， 2:"
