    "text": "vul_name : Dovecot 1.2.7 Insecure prmissions Local Privilege Escalation ， vul_cve : CVE-2009-3897 ， vul_poc :  ， This is mainly to fix the 0777 base_dir creation issue , which could be ， considered a security hole , exploitable by local users. An attacker ， could for example replace Dovecot's auth socket and log in as other ， users. Gaining root privileges isn't possible though. ， This affects only v1.2 users , v1.1 and older versions were creating the ， directory with 0755 permission. ， If your Dovecot's base_dir isn't in /var/run/dovecot/ , you should also ， make sure that the $ prefix/var/ and $ prefix/var/run/ ，  ( i.e. /usr/local/var/ , /usr/local/var/run/ by default ) aren't 0777. ，  * Dovecot v1.2.x had been creating base_dir ( and its parents if ， necessary ) with 0777 permissions. The base_dir's permissions get ， changed to 0755 automatically at startup , but you may need to ， chmod the parent directories manually. ， - acl : If user has rights from more than one group , merge them instead ， of choosing one group's rights and ignoring others. ， - virtual : When using a lot of mailboxes , the virtual mailbox's header ， could have grown over 32 kB and caused \"out of memory\" crashes. Also ， over 64 kB headers couldn't even be updated with existing transaction ， log records. Added a new record type that gets used with >= 64 kB ， headers. Older Dovecot versions don't understand this header and ， will log errors if they see it. ， - FETCH BODYSTRUCTURE didn't return RFC 2231 \"key * \" fields correctly",
