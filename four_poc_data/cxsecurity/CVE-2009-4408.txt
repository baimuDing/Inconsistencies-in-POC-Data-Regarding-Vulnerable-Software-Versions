The first allows arbitrary script to run when a post is viewed. The second allows attackers to submit forms ( such as changing password ) automatically without user's knowledge. ， XSS vulnerability lies in the BBcode parsing in module `models.parser`. The `img` and `url` tags do not sanitize inputs and hence are susceptible to script injection. ， CSRF vulnerability lies in the design of this web application. Forms do not have secure cookies and may be automatically submitted on behalf of the user. ， These bugs are rated at critical because they can be easily exploited and cause lost of integrity. ， These bugs may exist in older versions and in zForum , from which pyForum derives , too. ， Workaround ， There is no workaround. ， Fix ， There is no fix at the moment. ， Disclosure ， Blue Moon Consulting adapts `RFPolicy v2.0 < in notifying vendors. ，  : Initial vendor contact :  ， December 05 , 2009 : Notice sent to Julio Flores Schwarzbeck ( techfuel.net )  ， December 09 , 2009 : Reminder sent to Julio Flores Schwarzbeck ，  : Vendor response :  ，  : Further communication :  ，  : Public disclosure : December 15 , 2009",
