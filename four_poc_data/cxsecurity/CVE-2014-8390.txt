Advisory Information ， Title : Schneider Vampset Stack and Heap Buffer Overflow ， Advisory ID : CORE-2015-0007 ， Advisory URL :  ， Date published : 2015-03-30 ， Date of last update : 2015-03-27 ， Vendors contacted : Schneider ， Release mode : Coordinated release ， 2. Vulnerability Information ， Class : Heap-based Buffer Overflow [ CWE-122 ]  , Stack-based Buffer Overflow [ CWE-121 ]  ， Impact : Code execution ， Remotely Exploitable : No ， Locally Exploitable : Yes ， CVE Name : CVE-2014-8390 , CVE-2014-8390 ， 3. Vulnerability Description ， User-friendly and free of charge VAMPSET software [ 1 ] has been designed for setting parameters and configuring relays and is suitable for the entire VAMP range of protection relays , VAMP 321 arc flash protection unit and measuring and monitoring units. This indispensable setting and configuration tool allows relay parameters , configurations and recorded data to be exchanged between a computer and a VAMP relay using various communication cables. ， VAMPSET handles the relay settings as documents , vef-files. Settings of one physical device are considered one document. Documents can be read from the relay and transferred between similar relays. Documents can also be saved to the computer hard drive , and later loaded back to the relay using VAMPSET. ， VAMPSET is vulnerable to a Stack-based and Heap-based buffer overflow attack , which can be exploited by attackers to execute arbitrary code , by providing a malicious CFG or DAT file with specific parameters. ， 4. Vulnerable packages ， VAMPSET v2.2.145 ， Other versions are probably affected too , but they were not checked. ， 5. Vendor Information , Solutions and Workarounds ， Given that this is a client-side vulnerability , affected users should avoid opening untrusted .cfg or .dat files. Core Security also recommends those affected use third party software such as Sentinel [ 3 ] or EMET [ 2 ] that could help to prevent the exploitation of affected systems to some extent. ， The vendor published the following advisory [ 5 ] that includes mitigation instrucctions and a reference to the updated software. ， 6. Credits ， This vulnerability was discovered and researched by Ricardo Narvaja from Core Security Exploit Writing Team. The publication of this advisory was coordinated by Joaqun Rodrguez Varela from Core Security Advisories Team.",
