These chips are present in both mobile devices and Wi-Fi routers , and are capable of handling many Wi-Fi related events without delegating to the host OS. ， In order to allow fast roaming between access points in a wireless network , the Broadcom firmware supports the Fast BSS Transition feature ( IEEE 802.11r-2008 FT )  , allowing a client to roam between APs in the same mobility domain. When a client decides to roam to a different AP in an FT network ( in the same mobility domain )  , it first performs Authentication and then Reassociation. ， During the Reassociation process , the client parses the Fast Transition Information Element in order to decrypt and install the embedded GTK. The FT-IE has the following structure :  ，  | Tag ( 55 )  | Length | MIC CTRL | MIC | Anonce | Snonce | Sub-Elements |  ， 0 1 2 4 20 52 84 X ， Where each sub-element has the following structure :  ，  | Tag | Length | Key Info | Key Length | RSC | Key Data |  ， 0 1 2 4 5 13 X ，  ( See 802.11-2016 , 9.4.2.48 for more information ) . ， On the BCM4355C0 SoC with firmware version 9.44.78.27.0.1.56 the Fast Transition Reassociation process is handled by ROM function 0x8462C. This function retrieves the FT-IE from the last association response and parses it in order to extract the GTK. Here is the approximate high-level logic",
