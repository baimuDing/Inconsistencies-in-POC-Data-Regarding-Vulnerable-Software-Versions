The JupiterX Core plugin is required for the JupiterX theme. ， The classic Jupiter Theme contains a function , uninstallTemplate , which is intended to reset a site after a template is uninstalled , but has the additional effect of elevating the user calling the function to an administrator role. In JupiterX , this functionality has been migrated to the JupiterX Core plugin. Vulnerable versions register AJAX actions but do not perform any capability checks or nonce checks. ， On a site with a vulnerable version of the Jupiter Theme installed , any logged-in user can elevate their privileges to those of an administrator by sending an AJAX request with the action parameter set to abb_uninstall_template. ， This calls the uninstallTemplate function , which calls the resetWordpressDatabase function , where the site is effectively reinstalled with the currently logged-in user as the new site owner. ， On a site where a vulnerable version of the JupiterX Core plugin is installed , the same functionality can also be accessed by sending an AJAX request with the action parameter set to jupiterx_core_cp_uninstall_template. ， Description : Insufficient Access Control leading to Authenticated Arbitrary Plugin Deactivation and Settings Modification ， Affected Software : JupiterX Theme and JupiterX Core Plugin ， Slug ( s )  : jupiterx ( theme )  , jupiterx-core ( plugin )  ， Developer : ArtBees ， Affected Versions : JupiterX Theme <= 2.0.6 and JupiterX Core <= 2.0.6 ， CVE ID : CVE-2022-1656 ， CVSS score : 6.5 ( Medium )  ， CVSS Vector : CVSS : 3.1/AV : N/AC : L/PR : L/UI : N/S : U/C : N/I : H/A : N ， Researcher ( s )  : Ramuel Gall ， Fully Patched Versions : JupiterX Theme 2.0.7 and JupiterX Core Plugin 2.0.7 ， This vulnerability allows an attacker to reduce site security or damage functionality. ， Vulnerable versions of the JupiterX Theme allow any logged-in user , including subscriber-level users , to access any of the functions registered in lib/api/api/ajax.php , which also grant access to the jupiterx_api_ajax_ actions registered by the JupiterX Core Plugin. This includes the ability to deactivate arbitrary plugins as well as update the themes API key. ， Description : Authenticated Path Traversal and Local File Inclusion ， Affected Software : JupiterX Theme and Jupiter Theme ， Slug ( s )  : jupiterx ( theme )  , jupiter ( theme )  ， Developer : ArtBees ， Affected Versions : JupiterX Theme <= 2.0.6 and Jupiter Theme <= 6.10.1 ， CVE ID : CVE-2022-1657 ， CVSS score : 8.1 ( High )  ， CVSS Vector : CVSS : 3.1/AV : N/AC : L/PR : L/UI : N/S : U/C : H/I : H/A : N ， Researcher ( s )  : Ramuel Gall ， Fully Patched Versions : JupiterX Theme 2.0.7 and Jupiter Theme 6.10.2 ， This vulnerability could allow an attacker to obtain privileged information , such as nonce values , or perform restricted actions , by including and executing files from any location on the site. ， Vulnerable versions of the Jupiter and JupiterX Themes allow logged-in users , including subscriber-level users , to perform Path Traversal and Local File inclusion. ， In the JupiterX theme , the jupiterx_cp_load_pane_action AJAX action present in the lib/admin/control-panel/control-panel.php file calls the load_control_panel_pane function. It is possible to use this action to include any local PHP file via the slug parameter. ， The Jupiter theme has a nearly identical vulnerability which can be exploited via the mka_cp_load_pane_action AJAX action present in the framework/admin/control-panel/logic/functions.php file , which calls the mka_cp_load_pane_action function. ， Description : Insufficient Access Control leading to Authenticated Arbitrary Plugin Deletion ， Affected Software : Jupiter Theme ， Slug ( s )  : jupiter ( theme )  ， Developer : ArtBees ， Affected Versions : Jupiter Theme <= 6.10.1 ， CVE ID : CVE-2022-1658 ， CVSS score : 6.5 ( Medium )  ， CVSS Vector : CVSS : 3.1/AV : N/AC : L/PR : L/UI : N/S : U/C : N/I : H/A : N ， Researcher ( s )  : Ramuel Gall ， Fully Patched Versions : Jupiter Theme 6.10.2 ， This vulnerability allows an attacker to reduce site security or damage functionality. ， Vulnerable versions of the Jupiter Theme allow arbitrary plugin deletion by any authenticated user , including users with the subscriber role , via the abb_remove_plugin AJAX action registered in the framework/admin/control-panel/logic/plugin-management.php file. ， Using this functionality , any logged-in user can delete any installed plugin on the site. ， Description : Information Disclosure , Modification , and Denial of Service ， Affected Software : JupiterX Core Plugin ， Slug ( s )  : jupiterx-core ( plugin )  ， Developer : ArtBees ， Affected Versions : JupiterX Core Plugin <= 2.0.6 ， CVE ID : CVE-2022-1659 ， CVSS score : 6.3 ( Medium )  ， CVSS Vector : CVSS : 3.1/AV : N/AC : L/PR : L/UI : N/S : U/C : L/I : L/A : L ， Researcher ( s )  : Ramuel Gall ， Fully Patched Versions : JupiterX Core Plugin 2.0.7 ， This vulnerability allows an attacker to view site configuration and logged-in users , modify post conditions , or perform a denial of service attack. ， Vulnerable versions of the JupiterX Core plugin register an AJAX action jupiterx_conditional_manager which can be used to call any function in the includes/condition/class-condition-manager.php file by sending the desired function to call in the sub_action parameter. ， Timeline ， April 5 , 2022 - The Wordfence Threat Intelligence team finishes our investigation of the Jupiter and JupiterX Themes. We release a firewall rule to protect Wordfence Premium , Wordfence Care , and Wordfence Response customers. We contact the theme developer and send over the full disclosure. ， April 28 , 2022 - A partially patched version of the JupiterX theme and JupiterX Core plugin is released. ， May 3 , 2022 - We follow up with the theme developer about additional patches and notify them of an additional vulnerability we found in the Jupiter Theme. ， May 4 , 2022 - Firewall rule becomes available to Wordfence free users. ， May 10 , 2022 - Fully Patched versions of the Jupiter Theme and JupiterX Core plugin are released. We verify that all vulnerabilities are addressed. ， Conclusion ， In todays article , we covered a number of vulnerabilities present in the Jupiter and JupiterX themes and the JupiterX Core companion plugin. The most severe vulnerability allows any logged-in user to easily gain administrator privileges. ， Wordfence Premium , Wordfence Care , and Wordfence Response customers have been protected from these vulnerabilities since April 5 , 2022 , and free Wordfence users received the same protection on May 4 , 2022. ， We strongly recommend updating to the latest versions of the impacted themes and plugins available immediately. ， Since several versions across several slugs are impacted , well reiterate what you should update :  ， If you are running the Jupiter Theme version 6.10.1 or below , you should immediately update to version 6.10.2 or higher. ， If you are running the JupiterX Theme version 2.0.6 or below , you should immediately update to version 2.0.7 or higher. ， If you are running the JupiterX Core Plugin version 2.0.7 or below , you should immediately update it to version 2.0.8 or higher. ， If you know anyone using the Jupiter theme or the JupiterX theme , we urge you to forward this advisory to them as the most severe vulnerability allows complete site takeover. ， If you believe your site has been compromised as a result of this vulnerability or any other vulnerability , we offer Incident Response services via Wordfence Care. If you need your site cleaned immediately , Wordfence Response offers the same service with 24/7/365 availability and a 1-hour response time. Both these products include hands-on support in case you need further assistance.",
