After hours of gdb and caffeine , you've finally got a shell ，  * on your target's server. Maybe next time they will think twice about ，  * running MyFirstCompSciProjectFTPD on a production machine. As you take ，  * another sip of Mountain Dew and pick some of the cheetos out of your beard ,  ，  * you begin to plan your next move - it's time to tackle the kernel. ，  * What should be your goal? Privilege escalation? That's impossible , there's ，  * no such thing as a privilege escalation vulnerability on Linux. Denial of ，  * service? What are you , some kind of script kiddie? No , the answer is ，  * obvious. You must read the uninitialized bytes of the kernel stack , since ，  * these bytes contain all the secrets of the universe and the meaning of life. ，  * How can you accomplish this insidious feat? You immediately discard the ，  * notion of looking for uninitialized struct members that are copied back to ，  * userspace , since you clearly need something far more elite. In order to ，  * prove your superiority , your exploit must be as sophisticated as your taste ，  * in obscure electronic music. After scanning the kernel source for good ，  * candidates , you find your target and begin to code. ，  * by Dan Rosenberg ，  * Greets to kees , taviso , jono , spender , hawkes , and bla",
