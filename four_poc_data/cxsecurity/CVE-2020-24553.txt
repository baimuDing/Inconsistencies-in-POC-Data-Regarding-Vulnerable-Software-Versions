This may lead to cross-site scripting vulnerabilities even if ， uploaded data has been validated during upload. ， Details ， Product : Go ， Affected Versions : <= 1.14.7 , 1.15 ， Fixed Versions : 1.14.8 , 1.15.1 ， Vulnerability Type : Cross-Site Scripting ， Security Risk : medium ， Vendor URL :  ， Vendor Status : fixed version released ， Advisory URL :  ， Advisory Status : published ， CVE : CVE-2020-24553 ， CVE URL :  ， Introduction ， The Go standard library defines the ResponseWriter [ 1 ] interface in the ， net/http package for HTTP services. It allows serving content via ， arbitrary transports so the handler functions can be written without a ， specific transport in mind. The standard library contains an HTTP server ， implementation as well as CGI and FastCGI protocol implementations. The ， library also contains a mock implementation called ResponseRecorder [ 2 ]  ， in the net/http/httptest package for use in testing. There may even be ， more implementations outside the standard library. ， More Details ， In Go , the documentation of the interface describes the behavior all ， implementations should conform to. For the Write (  ) method of the ， interface , the following paragraph describes what happens if Write (  ) is ， called when the HTTP header Content-Type is not set ( via WriteHeader (  )  :  ， / If WriteHeader has not yet been called , Write calls ， / WriteHeader ( http.StatusOK ) before writing the data. If the Header ， / does not contain a Content-Type line , Write adds a Content-Type set ， / to the result of passing the initial 512 bytes of written data to ， / DetectContentType. Additionally , if the total size of all written ， / data is under a few KB and there are no Flush calls , the ， / Content-Length header is added automatically. ， If no Content-Type header is specified explicitly , all implementations ， of the ResponseWriter interface should therefore use the first 512 bytes ， of the data passed to Write (  ) to automatically detect and serve a ， sensible Content-Type according to the algorithm described in [ 3 ] . ， The HTTP server implementation as well as the ResponseRecorder mock ， implementation both exhibit the documented behavior. The CGI and FastCGI ， transports however were found to always set the Content-Type to",
