    "text": "vul_name : DoS attack on Windows 2000 Terminal Server ， vul_cve : CVE-2003-1544 ， vul_poc : This one's short and simple. ， Description ， Any user with sufficient permission to log on to a Windows 2000 Terminal ， Server ( via RDP or ICA ) and access its filesystem can reboot the server ， at will. ， Exploit ， - Open %SYSTEMROOT%\\SYSTEM32\\MSGINA.DLL for exclusive access ( read lock ) . ， I used Radsoft's HEXVIEW.EXE from Rix2K to do this. ， - Open a new connection to the server via RDP/ICA ， - Click the nice , helpful \"Restart\" button in the warning dialog that ， appears ( \"msgina.dll failed to load\" )  ， Tested on Windows 2000 Server ( IE55 , SP2 ) and Windows 2000 Server ( IE55 ,  ， SP3 ) . I do not have easy access to other platforms at the moment. ， Workaround ， - Remove all permissions from MSGINA.DLL for \"Power Users\" , \"Users\" and ， \"Everyone\" ， Note : The above workaround has been tested on Windows 2000 Server ( IE55 ,  ， SP2 ) and users were still able to log in as normal. I am not aware of a ， need for MSGINA.DLL to be accessible by normal users , but if there are ， any such circumstances Microsoft will need to produce an alternative fix. ， Vendor status ， Contacted on 16/01/2003. Replied to my email the next day requesting ， additional time to investigate. No further replies since 17/01/2003. ， Thanks ， Thanks to PPH for the use of a Windows 2000 Server IE55 , SP2 machine !
