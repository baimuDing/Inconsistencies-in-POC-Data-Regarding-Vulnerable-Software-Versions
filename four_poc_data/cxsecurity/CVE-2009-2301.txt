It enables PCI compliance by mitigating Web ， application security threats and vulnerabilities to prevent data theft ， and manipulation of sensitive corporate and customer information. ， AppWall incorporates advanced , patent-protected Web application security ， filtering technologies to seamlessly detect threats , block attacks and ， report events. ， Source :  ， Vulnerability Description ， The radware AppWall Web Application Firewall operates as a reverse proxy ， between the clients and the web server to be protected. All HTTP ， requests are checked before being forwarded to the web server. The ， system can be administered via a seperate management interface which is ， normally not accessible for external users. The web interface is ， realised using the PHP programming language. Some of the functionality ， is stored in include files and embedded when needed. The files have a ，  * .inc extension and are not interpreted by the web server. A ， user/attacker with access to the web management interface can therefore ， access parts of the product source code by requesting the included files ， directly. ， Proof of Conept ， The following example requests reveal product source code enabling an ， attacker to search for further implementation vulnerabilities :  ， Vulnerable Versions ， The tested version was Gateway Version 4.6.0.2 / AppWall Version ， 1.0.2.6. Prior versions are also likely to be vulnerable. ， Patch ， Currently we are not aware of any patch or update available. ， Contact Timeline ， 2009-06-01 : Vendor informed ， 2009-06-15 : No response yet.
