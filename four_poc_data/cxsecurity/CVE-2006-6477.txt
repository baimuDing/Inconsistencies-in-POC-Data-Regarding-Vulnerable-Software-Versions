The ， First Response agent (FRAgent.exe) can be installed and configured as a ， daemon on target hosts in order to collect information remotely via a ， First Response Command Console. Multiple vulnerabilities exist that could ， lead to a variety of attack payloads. Agents running in either HTTP or ， SSL mode are vulnerable to denial of service and server hijacking ， conditions. The server hijacking vulnerability present in HTTP agents can ， be further leveraged to allow a rogue process to intercept and modify ， legitimate agent/console communication, and force a Command Console to ， download arbitrary content and visit arbitrary URLs. ， Details: ， Vulnerability #1: Denial of Service against an SSL agent through malformed ， client requests ， When run in daemon mode, the First Response agent (FRAgent.exe) accepts ， remote connections from a First Response console via HTTP or a modified ， HTTPS implementation. By sending a series of specially-crafted requests ， to an SSL-enabled agent, it is possible to force the agent to throw an ， exception that is not properly handled. After this occurs, the agent's ， sockets will enter an indefinite CLOSE_WAIT state and all subsequent ， connection attempts will be refused. The service then must be restarted ， in order to recover and accept connections again. ， Vulnerability #2: Denial of Service against an HTTP or SSL agent through ， Agent hijacking ， An FRAgent daemon permits other processes to bind to the same socket ， addresses on which it is already listening. If FRAgent is bound to a ， 0.0.0.0 wildcard address (\"all interfaces\"), a rogue process can intercept ， client connections by subsequently binding to the same port on a specific ， IP address. By hijacking an agent with a non-responsive listener, an ， attacker can effectively prevent all legitimate client connections. ， Vulnerability #3: Command Console and Data Manipulation through HTTP ， Agent Hijacking ， If an HTTP FRAgent daemon is hijacked, the attacker can control the response ， data sent to and processed by a client, as well as other aspects of client ， behavior. A rogue process can conduct a man-in-the-middle attack to ， redirect and modify all requests and responses between the client and a ， legitimate agent. The attacker can also send specially-crafted HTTP ， responses that force the client to visit arbitrary URLs and/or download ， arbitrary content. (NOTE: The use of HTTPS/SSL is default behavior for First ， Response; using cleartext HTTP requires manual configuration.)"
