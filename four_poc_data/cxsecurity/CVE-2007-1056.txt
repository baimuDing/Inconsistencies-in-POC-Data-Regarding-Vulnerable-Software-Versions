    "text": "vul_name : VMware Workstation multiple denial of service and isolation manipulation vulnerabilities ， vul_cve : CVE-2007-1056 ， vul_poc :  ， Suggested severity level : Medium. ， Type of Risk : Denial of Service , Privilege Elevation , Un-authorize Access. ， Affected Software : VMware Workstation , version 5.5.3 build 34685 ( including ， installation of \"VMware Tools\" of the same version , in the guest OS ) . ，  ( Older versions and other products by the vendor using the same components ， may be affected as well , but they weren't tested due to lack of resources. ， I advise administrators who use the corporate products of VMware to test ， this issues if they use this products in a production environment )  ， Host and Guest OS : Windows XP Pro with SP2 and all the latest operational ， and security patches from the \"windows update\" site , up to 10-Feb-2007. ，  ( Older versions and other guest operating systems ( especially ones by ， Microsoft ) may be affected as well , but they weren't tested ) . ， Local / Remote activated : Local. ， Summary : If the \"Toolbox\" component of \"VMware Tools\" is installed on the ， guest OS , it is usually installed under the path ， \"c : \\program files\\vmware\\vmware tools\\\". ， When installed , the folder and its files inherit the security permissions ， from their father folder which itself inherits the permissions from the ， \"c : \\program files\\\" folder. ， Thus the permissions are as follows :  ， Creator Owner , System , Administrators = Full Control. ， Power Users = Modify. ， Users = Read & Execute. ， The \"VMware tools\" installation also creates a service named \"VMware tools ， service\" which handles the communication and commands between the guest OS ， and the host OS. ， This service is running using the \"System\" privileged account. ， The above mentioned directory holds files , that when executed by a local ， user with a highest local group membership of \"users\" , at the guest OS , can ， perform the following actions , which are prohibited by default to members of ， the local \"users\" group ( and allowed only to more privileged groups like ， \"Power Users\" and \"Administrators\" )  :  ， 1. Change the system time ( limited to setting the guest OS time to be ， in-sync or out-of-sync with the time of the host OS - thus changing the time ， accordingly , but not setting a specific date and/or time )  ， 2. Disable or enable the VM \"hardware\" devices ( limited to Network Interface ， Card , Optical drive , Floppy drive and the Audio card )  ， 3. Stop a service ( limited to the \"VMware tools service\" service )  ， This operations are performed at the VMware level , one level \"outside\" the ， OS , so the OS itself maintains its security rights model working normally ， and enforcing its rules - but since the \"VMware Tools\" component is enabling ， direct access to the machine's \"hardware\" , the effective result is similar ， to privileges elevation ( at a partial scope , as mentioned above ) . ， I guess the main reason for this happening is because VMware Workstation ， does not enforce any authentication and authorization mechanism , within the ， guest OS , when performing this actions. ， Thus it looks like any user in the guest OS , probably at any security group ， membership level , can perform this actions if he has the access to read and ， execute the needed files. ， Further tests I have performed shows that even if the permissions will be ， hardened at the above path or even if the Toolbox component will be ， uninstalled completely ( also removing the \"VMware tools service\" service ) - ， them from any path - the results will be the same ( for the \"hardware\" ， related actions ) since the vulnerability is built-in from the way this files ， communicate with VM \"hardware\". ， Possible Abuses :  ， 1. Changing the system time of the guest OS , to be in-sync or out-of-sync ， with the host OS - thus causing a global system change , effecting events ， scheduling , files and folders time stamps , event logs records time stamps ,  ， etc. . ， 2. Shutting down hardware components , which the most important of them is ， the network card. ， 3. Activating disabled hardware components ( that may have been disabled to ， assure isolation between the guest OS and the host OS ) can grant the ， abilities to :  ， 3.1. Play sounds and voices from the guest OS to the host OS physical ， environment. ， 3.2. Allow access to read and write data stored on removable storage devices ，  ( CD/DVD and/or floppy ) . ， 3.3. Connect an isolated guest OS to the host OS and its network ( s ) and ， maybe to the internet , by enabling the network card. ， 4. Stopping the service that connects and controls the operations between ， the guest and the host operating systems ( the \"VMware tools service\" ， service ) .",
