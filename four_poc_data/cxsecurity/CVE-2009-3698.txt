The malformed SMS ， message consists of a badly formatted WAP Push message which causes an ， Java ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException in the phone application ，  ( android.com.phone ) . ， The phone application silently restarts without user awareness , this leads ， to a temporary loss of connectivity ( as well as dropping of current calls ,  ， due to required PIN re-entry and the need for user attention. Triggering ， this bug ( repeatedly in case no PIN is present ) is considered a remote DoS ， condition. ， The second report addresses a number of issues discovered in the Android's ， Dalvik API , one of them has been classified by the Android team as a DoS ， vulnerability which leads to restarting the system process. ， A specific malicious application can be crafted so that if it is ， downloaded and executed by the user , it would trigger the vulnerable API ， function and restart the system process. The same condition could occur if ， a developer unintentionally places the vulnerable function in a place ， where the execution path leads to that function call. Triggering this bug ， is considered a DoS condition. ， All the reported issues have been patched. ， Affected version :  ， Malformed SMS DoS :  ， Android all 1.5 CRBx versions ( where xx are digits )  ， Dalvik API DoS :  ， Android <= 1.5 ， Fixed version :  ， Malformed SMS DoS :  ， Android 1.5 CBDx , CRCx and COCx ( where xx are digits )  ， Dalvik API DoS :  ， Android >= Donut DRC79 ， Credit : Charlie Miller , Collin Mulliner ( malformed SMS DoS ) .
