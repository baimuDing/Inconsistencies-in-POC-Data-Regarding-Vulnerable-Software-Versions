It has a threaded daemon which periodically ， runs from cron. It works with small .nfo files which hold router ， information and optionally connection details , colors , min max ,  ， bandwidth settings , etc , etc. RRDBrowse uses a small caching mechanism ， to store interface names. It's much MRTG like in it's current state\". ， More information about the product can be found online at ， IV - DETAILS ， Due to inproper input validation , the CGI application \"rrdbrowse\" ，  ( versions <= 1.6 ) is vulnerable to an arbitrary file disclosure ， vulnerability. It allows an unauthenticated remote attacker to read any ， file on the remote system if the user the webserver is running as has ， permissions to do so. Thus an attacker is able to gain access ， potentially sensitive information. ， V - EXPLOIT CODE ， The vulnerability is trivial to exploit and only requires specifying an ， URL with a relative file path on the remote system such as ， /passwd ， As the input to the \"file\" parameter is not validated in any way ， accessing this URL will expose the contents of /etc/passwd to a remote ， attacker ( interestingly except the first line ) . ， VI - WORKAROUND/FIX ， To address this problem , the author of rrdbrowse ( Tommy van Leeuwen ) has ， released an updated CVS version ( 1.7 ) of the software which is available ， at Hence all users of rrdbrowse are asked to ， test and install this version as soon as possible.",
