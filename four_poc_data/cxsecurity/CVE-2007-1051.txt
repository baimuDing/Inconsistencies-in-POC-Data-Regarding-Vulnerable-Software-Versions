    "text": "vul_name : Comodo DLL injection via weak hash function exploitation Vulnerability ， vul_cve : CVE-2007-1051 ， vul_poc : Hello ,  ， We would like to inform you about a vulnerability in Comodo Firewall Pro. ， Description :  ， Comodo Firewall Pro ( former Comodo Personal Firewall ) implements a component control , which is based on a checksum ， comparison of process modules. Probably to achieve a better performance , cyclic redundancy check ( CRC32 ) is used as a ， checksum function in its implementation. However , CRC32 was developed for error detection purposes and can not be used ， as a reliable cryptographic hashing function because it is possible to generate collisions in real time. The character ， of CRC32 allows attacker to construct a malicious module with the same CRC32 checksum as a chosen trusted module in the ， target system and thus bypass the protection of the component control. ， Vulnerable software :  ，  * Comodo Firewall Pro 2.4.17.183 ，  * Comodo Firewall Pro 2.4.16.174 ，  * Comodo Personal Firewall 2.3.6.81 ，  * probably all older versions of Comodo Personal Firewall 2 ，  * possibly older versions of Comodo Personal Firewall ， More details and a proof of concept including its source code are available here :  ， sh-function-exploitation.php ， Regards ,  ， Matousec - Transparent security Research",
