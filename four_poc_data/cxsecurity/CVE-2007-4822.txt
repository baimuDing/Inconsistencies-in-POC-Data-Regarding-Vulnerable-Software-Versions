Thus, it is possible for an attacker to perform any ， administrative action in the management interface. These include ， e.g. changing administrative password or adding new firewall rules. ， Details: ， Buffalo AirStation WHR-G54S Ver.1.20 device management interface ， does not validate the origin of an HTTP request. If attacker is able ， to make user visit a hostile web page, a device can be controlled ， by submitting suitable forms. It is possible to add new users for ， example. ， Successful attack requires that the attacker knows the management ， interface address for the target device. As authentication is done ， using HTTP Basic authentication, exploiting this vulnerability ， requires more effort compared to forms authentication."
