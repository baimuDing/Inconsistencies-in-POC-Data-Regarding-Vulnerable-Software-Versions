    "text": "vul_name : Apache Tomcat 5.x / 6.x / 7.x DIGEST Authentication Weaknesses ， vul_cve : CVE-2012-3439 ， vul_poc : CVE-2012-3439 Apache Tomcat DIGEST authentication weaknesses ， Severity : Moderate ， Vendor : The Apache Software Foundation ， Versions Affected :  ， - - Tomcat 7.0.0 to 7.0.29 ， - - Tomcat 6.0.0 to 6.0.35 ， - - Tomcat 5.5.0 to 5.5.35 ， - - Earlier , unsupported versions may also be affected ， Description :  ， Three weaknesses in Tomcat's implementation of DIGEST authentication ， were identified and resolved :  ， 1. Tomcat tracked client rather than server nonces and nonce count. ， 2. When a session ID was present , authentication was bypassed. ， 3. The user name and password were not checked before when indicating ， that a nonce was stale. ， These issues reduced the security of DIGEST authentication making ， replay attacks possible in some circumstances. ， Mitigation :  ， Users of affected versions should apply one of the following mitigations :  ， - - Tomcat 7.0.x users should upgrade to 7.0.30 or later ， - - Tomcat 6.0.x users should upgrade to 6.0.36 or later ， - - Tomcat 5.5.x users should upgrade to 5.5.36 or later ， Credit :  ， The first issue was identified by Tilmann Kuhn. The second and third ， issues were identified by the Tomcat security team during the code ， review resulting from the first issue.",
