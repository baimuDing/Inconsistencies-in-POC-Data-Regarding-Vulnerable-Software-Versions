While researching CVE-2019-0841 ，  # originally reported by Nabeel Ahmed , I have found that AppXSvc can be forced ，  # to overwrite an arbitrary file by deleting all registry data files before ，  # creating the file hard link. As Nabeel Ahmed described in his write-up of ，  # CVE-2019-0841 , if the settings.dat file is corrupted it will be replaced with ，  # the original settings.dat template. However , additional settings.dat.LOG1 and ，  # settings.dat.LOG2 files are also created during the initialization process. ，  # Substituting the settings.dat.LOG1 or the settings.dat.LOG2 file with a hard ，  # link allows a low privileged user to overwrite an arbitrary file with registry ，  # data or just simply empty it , respectively. A low privileged user could exploit ，  # this vulnerability to cause denial of service by overwriting critical system ，  # files.",
