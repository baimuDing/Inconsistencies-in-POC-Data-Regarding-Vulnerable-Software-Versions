The full ， advisory with technical details is available at the following link :  ， _ ， I. Impact ， If the HiSuite software is installed on a Windows system , any authenticated user can escalate privileges to become the SYSTEM user by placing a crafted DLL file in the HiSuite service directory and triggering or waiting for the next system reboot. ， II. Technical Details ， Huawei HiSuite is a mobile synchronization software that helps mobile phone users to manage their mobile phones. It handles contacts , media and all installed applications. It also has some backup functionality. ， HiSuite installs a Windows service called HuaweiHiSuiteService64.exe which is running as SYSTEM. The service binary of the same name is located in the directory \"C : \\ProgramData\\HandSetService\\\". ， The ACLs set on this directory allow any authenticated user to create new files as can be seen by the FILE_WRITE_DATA access right below :  ， C : \\>cacls c : \\programdata\\HandSetService ， c : \\programdata\\HandSetService NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM :  ( OI )  ( CI )  ( ID ) F ， BUILTIN\\Administrators :  ( OI )  ( CI )  ( ID ) F ， CREATOR OWNER :  ( OI )  ( CI )  ( IO )  ( ID ) F ， BUILTIN\\Users :  ( OI )  ( CI )  ( ID ) R ， BUILTIN\\Users :  ( CI )  ( ID )  ( special access :  )  ， FILE_WRITE_DATA ， FILE_APPEND_DATA ， FILE_WRITE_EA ， FILE_WRITE_ATTRIBUTES ， When the service is started it tries to load several non-existing DLL files from the service directory such as SspiCli.dll or USERENV.dll. ， A user can place a malicious DLL file with one of the expected names into that directory and wait until the service is restarted. The service can not be restarted by normal users but an attacker could just reboot the system or wait for the next reboot to happen. ， Afterwards his malicious DLL file would be loaded by the service which is running with SYSTEM privileges which would give the attacker full control over the machine. ， III. Mitigation ， Software update HiSuite 4.0.4.204_ove ( Out of China ) or HiSuite 4.0.4.301 ( China ) should be installed. Alternatively the ACLs on the service directory should be adjusted to prevent normal users from writing to this directory.",
