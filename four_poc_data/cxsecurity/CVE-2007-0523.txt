    "text": "vul_name : Bluetooth DoS by obex push [ readable ]  ， vul_cve : CVE-2007-0524 , CVE-2007-0523 , CVE-2007-0522 , CVE-2007-0521 ， vul_poc : Sorry for the trouble with the wrong characters , below the corrected text with attachment in plain text :  ， Using ussp-push [ 1 ]  , it is possible to send out files very quickly. By continuously trying to push a file , the target is flooded with prompts whether to accept the file or not , which disables any other usage on the phone , including the ability to turn off Bluetooth. ， We confirmed the attack to work on the following phones ( all tested ones !  )  :  ， - Sony Ericsson K700i ， - Nokia N70 ， - Motorola MOTORAZR V3 ， - Sony Ericsson W810i ， - LG Chocolate KG800 ， and expect nearly all available phones with Bluetooth to be vulnerable ( in contrary to the previous DoS by l2ping ) . ， A proof-of-concept code is attached , using ussp-push and targeting a known MAC. This could be easily extended to target all visible devices. ， Plus , a user could be forced to accept a possibly malicious file with this attack. Using only one Bluetooth-Dongle , we were able to practically disable three phones simlutaneously. ， Best regards ,  ， Stefan Ekerfelt and Armin Hornung ，  [ 1 ] ",
