The Java ， applet used for testing will not deliver any exploit code but just checks ， whether Java applets are loaded correctly. ， Fixes :  ， Execution of Java applets is blocked for emails from the internet in Notes ， 8.5.3 FP4 Interim Fix 1 and Notes 9.0 Interim Fix 1. ， See also ， Workarounds :  ， Turn off the execution of Java applets using the EnableJavaApplets=0 ， directive in notes.ini. It is also recommended to turn off LiveConnect with ， EnableLiveConnect=0 as this provides another way to execute Java code even ， Alternatively , the File -> Preferences -> Basic Notes ， Client Preferences GUI can be used to uncheck the Enable Java applets\" and ， the \"Enable Java access from JavaScript\" options. ， As Java applets are still executed for internal emails , it is strongly ， recommended to turn off this feature regardless of the implementation of the ， above-mentioned fix. ， _",
