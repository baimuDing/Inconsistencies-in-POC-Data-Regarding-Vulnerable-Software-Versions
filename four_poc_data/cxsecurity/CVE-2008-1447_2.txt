It consists of two parts :  ， 1. A DLL ( cygwin1.dll ) which acts as a Linux API emulation layer providing ， substantial Linux API functionality. ， 2. A collection of tools which provide Linux look and feel. ， SUMMARY ， Cygwin is a Linux-like environment for Microsoft Windows copyrighted by ， Red Hat , Inc. Tarball software packages are installed and updated via ， setup.exe. This program downloads a package list and packages from ， mirrors over plaintext HTTP or FTP. The package list contains MD5 ， checksums for verifying package integrity. If a rogue server answers the ， HTTP request responsible for package updates and responds with a ， modified MD5 string setup.exe will download and install a malicious package. ， ANALYSIS ， To successfully exploit this vulnerability an attacker must be able to ， somehow position themself such that they can impersonate a Cygwin mirror. ， As a proof-of-concept the local hosts file was modified but an attack ， that occurs in the wild can be accomplished through DNS cache ， poisoning , ARP redirection , TCP hijacking , impersonation of a Wi-Fi ， Access Point , etc. The attacker also would have configured a rogue web ， server to push out package code of their choosing. The success of ， attacks that utilize the DNS cache poisoning approach has recently been ， compounded by Kaminsky's birthday paradox technique ( CVE-2008-1447. )  ， For testing purposes , gzip was used as the malicious package although ， any and all packages can be trojanned ( including base-files. ) gzip was ， chosen for testing purposes because it is so common. A real attacker ， would probably target more of a lynchpin package like bash. The version ,  ， time , size , and MD5 sum of the gzip entry in the setup.ini file was ， modified for the rogue Cygwin server. The location of the altered gzip ， package was /sourceware/cygwin/release/gzip/gzip-3.1.33-7.tar.bz2. ， When setup.exe is executed it will automatically download the modified ， package from the rogue server. /usr/bin/gzip was replaced by /usr/bin/ls ， during Security Objectives' testing. In a real attack scenario bash ， could be trojanned or a complete rootkit could be installed. The user is ， likely to not even notice the malicious package being setup as it is ， auto-selected for installation. ， WORKAROUND ， Refrain from using Cygwin setup.exe versions prior to 2.573.2.3. ， VENDOR RESPONSE ， Cygwin Setup.exe version 2.573.2.3 addresses this vulnerability.",
