This allows loading arbitrary shared objects from ， the trusted library search path with the privileges of the suid user. ， This module uses LD_AUDIT to load the libpcprofile.so shared object ,  ， distributed with some versions of glibc , and leverages arbitrary file ， creation functionality in the library constructor to write a root-owned ， world-writable file to a system trusted search path ( usually /lib ) . ， The file is then overwritten with a shared object then loaded with ， LD_AUDIT resulting in arbitrary code execution. ， This module has been tested successfully on glibc version 2.12 on ， RHEL 5. ， Thanks to Brendan Coles and all Metasploit staff. ， }",
