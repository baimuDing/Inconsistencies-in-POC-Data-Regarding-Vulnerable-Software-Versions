    "text": "vul_name : Multiple vulnerabilities in Norman NVC 5.82 driver ， vul_cve : CVE-2007-4648 ， vul_poc : Abstract :  ， There are multiple bugs in nvcoaft51 driver from Norman products. ， These bugs could be locally exploited by a malicious user in order ， to gain unlimited access to the system. ， Nvcoaft51 driver creates a device named NvcOa without a restrictive ， security descriptor , so any user can open it and send control codes ， directly to the device driver. Arbitrary code execution at kernel mode ， is possible because the code that manages IOCTL's is not bug free. ， Detailed information and proof of concept exploit code of a tricky ， kernel pool overflow can be downloaded here :  ， Cheers ,  ， InocraM ? inocram [ at ] 48bits [ dot ] com ，  [ 48Bits I+D Team ] ",
