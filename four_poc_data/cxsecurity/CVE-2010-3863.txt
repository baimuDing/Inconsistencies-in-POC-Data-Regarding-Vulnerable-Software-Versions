The result is that Shiro filter ， chain matching logic was susceptible to potential path traversal attacks. ， Mitigation :  ， All users should upgrade to 1.1.0 ， Example :  ， For a shiro.ini [ urls ] section entry :  ， /account/ = authc , . ， / = anon ， This states that all requests to the /account/ pages should be ， authenticated ( as indicated by the 'authc' ( authentication ) filter ) in the ， chain definition. ， A malicious request could be sent :  ， GET /./account/index.jsp HTTP/1.1 ， And access would be granted because the path was not normalized to ， /account/index.jsp before evaluating the path for a match. ， Credit :  ， This issue was discovered by Luke Taylor of SpringSource. ， Les Hazlewood",
