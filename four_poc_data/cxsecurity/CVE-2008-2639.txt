Citect& # 39 ; s ， products are distributed in over 80 countries through a network of more ， than 500 partners. According to Citect& # 39 ; s website [ 1 ] the company , a ， fully owned subsidiary of Schneider Electric , has more than 150 , 000 ， licenses of its software sold to date. Citect& # 39 ; s products are used by ， organizations worldwide in numerous industries including Aerospace & ， Defense , Oil & Gas , Power/Utilities , Chemical , Pharmaceutical ,  ， Manufacturing and others. ， CitectSCADA ( Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition ) is a system with ， the primary function of collecting data and providing an interface to ， control equipment such as Programmable Logic Controllers ( PLCs )  , Remote ， Terminal Units ( RTUs ) etc. with an integrated Human Machine Interface ，  ( HMI ) / SCADA solution to deliver a scalable and reliable control and ， monitoring system. The system is composed by software installed on ， standard computer equipment running on commercial-of-the-shelf Microsoft ， Windows operating systems. ， A vulnerability was found in CitectSCADA that could allow a remote ， un-authenticated attacker to force an abnormal termination of the ， vulnerable software ( Denial of Service ) or to execute arbitrary code on ， vulnerable systems to gain complete control of the software. To ， accomplish such goal the would-be attacker must be able to connect to ， the vulnerable service on a TCP high-port. ，  * Vulnerable Packages *  ， . CitectSCADA v6 ， . CitectSCADA v7 ， . CitectFacilities v7 ，  * Non-vulnerable Packages *  ， . Contact the vendor for fixed versions of the product. ，  * Vendor Information , Solutions and Workarounds *  ， In general process control networks should be physically isolated from ， corporate or other publicly accessible data networks as such an isolated ， network will limit the exposure of systems with network facing ， vulnerabilities only to accidental disruption or potentially malicious ， users or systems within the process control network itself. ， However , if physical isolation of the process control network is not ， feasible it is strongly recommended to enforce and monitor strict ， network access control mechanisms to verify that only the absolute ， minimal required set of systems from both within and outside the process ， control network are allowed to connect to any systems within the process ， control network. In this particular case , access control mechanisms on ， both end-systems and network boundary devices such as firewalls and ， IPSes must ensure that only hardened and trusted systems from that ， minimal set can connect to systems in the process control network ， running potentially vulnerable software. Nonetheless systems on that ， minimal set must still be considered potential attack vectors into the ， process control network and should they become compromised , providers of ， transitive trust from the process control network to external untrusted ， systems. ， Besides the recommendation of a secure network architecture with strict ， network access control measures , OS hardening and other sound system ， administration practices a specific workaround for the vulnerability ， reported in this advisory is provided below. ， The vulnerability is located in the ODBC server service , vulnerable",
