    "text": "title : Apple QuickTime 7.6.7 _Marshaled_pUnk Code Execution  ， detail : This Metasploit module exploits a memory trust issue in Apple QuickTime 7.6.7. When processing a specially-crafted HTML page , the QuickTime ActiveX control will treat a supplied parameter as a trusted pointer. It will then use it as a COM-type pUnknown and lead to arbitrary code execution. This exploit utilizes a combination of heap spraying and the QuickTimeAuthoring.qtx module to bypass DEP and ASLR. This Metasploit module does not opt-in to ASLR. As such , this module should be reliable on all Windows versions. NOTE : The addresses may need to be adjusted for older versions of QuickTime.  ， cve : advisories | CVE-2010-1818  ，  ， desc :  #   ，  #  $ Id : apple_quicktime_marshaled_punk.rb 10196 2010-08-30 21 : 52 : 45Z jduck $   ，   ，  # This file is part of the Metasploit Framework and may be subject to  ，  # redistribution and commercial restrictions.
