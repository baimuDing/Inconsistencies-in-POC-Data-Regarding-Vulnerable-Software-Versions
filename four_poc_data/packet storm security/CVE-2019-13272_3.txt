    "text": "title : Linux Polkit pkexec Helper PTRACE_TRACEME Local Root  ， detail : This Metasploit module exploits an issue in ptrace_link in kernel/ptrace.c before Linux kernel 5.1.17. This issue can be exploited from a Linux desktop terminal , but not over an SSH session , as it requires execution from within the context of a user with an active Polkit agent. In the Linux kernel before 5.1.17 , ptrace_link in kernel/ptrace.c mishandles the recording of the credentials of a process that wants to create a ptrace relationship , which allows local users to obtain root access by leveraging certain scenarios with a parent-child process relationship , where a parent drops privileges and calls execve ( potentially allowing control by an attacker ) . One contributing factor is an object lifetime issue ( which can also cause a panic ) . Another contributing factor is incorrect marking of a ptrace relationship as privileged , which is exploitable through ( for example ) Polkit's pkexec helper with PTRACE_TRACEME.  ， cve : advisories | CVE-2019-13272  ，  ， desc :  #   ，  # This module requires Metasploit : https : /metasploit.com/download  ，  # Current source : https : /github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework",
