A new blocklist is added , and then an update is forced ( gravity ) to pull in the blocklist content. PHP content is then written to a file within the webroot. Phase 1 writes a sudo pihole command to launch teleporter , effectively running a privilege escalation. Phase 2 writes our payload to teleporter.php , overwriting the content. Lastly , the phase 1 PHP file is called in the web root , which launches our payload in teleporter.php with root privileges.  ， cve : advisories | CVE-2020-11108  ，  ， desc :  #   ，  # This module requires Metasploit : https : /metasploit.com/download  ，  # Current source : https : /github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework  ，   ， 'Description' => %q{  ， This exploits a command execution in Pi-Hole <= 4.4.
