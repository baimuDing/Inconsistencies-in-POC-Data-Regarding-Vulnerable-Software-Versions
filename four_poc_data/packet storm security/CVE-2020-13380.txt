    "text": "title : openSIS 7.4 SQL Injection  ， detail : openSIS versions 7.4 and below suffer from multiple remote SQL injection vulnerabilities.  ， cve : advisories | CVE-2020-13380 , CVE-2020-13381  ，  ， desc : -  ， openSIS <= 7.4 Multiple SQL Injection Vulnerabilities  ，  ，  [ - ] Software Link :   ， https : /opensis.com/  ，  [ - ] Affected Versions :   ， Version 7.4 and prior versions.  ，  [ - ] Vulnerabilities Description :   ， The application is affected by multiple SQL Injection vulnerabilities ,   ， following are some examples :   ， 1 ) User input passed through the \"api_key\" and \"api_secret\" parameters  ， to '/api/SchoolInfo.php' ,   ， '/api/StaffInfo.php' , and '/api/StudentEnrollmentInfo.php' is not  ， properly sanitized before being  ， used to construct a SQL query. This can be exploited by unauthenticated  ， attackers to e.g. read  ， sensitive data from the database through error-based SQL Injection  ， attacks.  ， 2 ) User input passed through the \"event_id\" parameter to  ， '/CalendarModal.php' is not properly  ， sanitized before being used to construct a SQL query. This can be  ， exploited by remote attackers  ， to e.g. read sensitive data from the database through in-band SQL  ， Injection attacks.  ， 3 ) User input passed through the \"course_id\" parameter to  ， '/modules/scheduling/MassSchedule.php'  ， is not properly sanitized before being used to construct a SQL query.  ， This can be exploited by  ， remote attackers to e.g. read sensitive data from the database through  ， SQL Injection attacks.  ， 4 ) User input passed through the \"student\" parameter to  ， '/modules/attendance/AddAbsences.php'  ， is not properly sanitized before being used to construct a SQL query.  ， This can be exploited by  ， remote attackers to e.g. read sensitive data from the database through  ， SQL Injection attacks.  ， NOTE : certain SQL Injection vulnerabilities in openSIS - like ( 3 ) or ( 4 )   ， - could also be  ， abused to execute arbitrary PHP code due to an unsafe use of the  ， \"eval (  ) \" PHP function  ， within the \"DBGet (  ) \" function defined in the '/functions/DbGetFnc.php'  ， script.  ，  [ - ] Solution :   ， Upgrade to version 7.4 to remediate vulnerabilities ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) .  ， No official solution is currently available for the other  ， vulnerabilities.",
