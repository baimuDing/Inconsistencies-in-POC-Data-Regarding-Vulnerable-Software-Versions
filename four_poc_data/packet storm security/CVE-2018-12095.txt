Most CMSs include Web-based publishing , format management , history editing and version control , indexing , search , and retrieval.  ， By their nature , content management systems support the separation of content and presentation.  ，   ， Vulnerability Disclosure :   ，  ， 2018-06-10 : Public Disclosure  ，   ， CVE - ID :   ，  ， CVE-2018-12095  ，   ， Affected Product ( s )  :   ，  ， OEcms v3.1  ，   ， Exploitation Technique :   ，  ， Remote  ，   ， Severity Level :   ，  ， High  ，   ， Technical Details & Description :   ，  ， A Reflected Cross-Site Scripting web vulnerability has been discovered in the \"OEcms v3.1\" web-application.  ， The vulnerability is located in the 'mod' parameter of the`info.php` action GET method request.  ，   ， Request Method ( s )  :   ，   ，  [ + ] GET  ，   ， Vulnerable Function ( s )  :   ，   ，  [ + ] info.php  ，   ， Vulnerable Parameter ( s )  :   ，   ，  [ + ] mod  ，   ， Proof of Concept ( PoC )  :   ，  ， Cross-Site Scripting , also known as XSS , is one of the most common attacks carried out in web applications.  ， The concept of XSS is to manipulate the client-side scripts of a web application to perform actions planned by a malicious user.  ， Reflected Cross-Site Scripting occurs when data sent by the attacker to the application is displayed on the page without the need to be stored somewhere.  ，   ，  [ + ] http : /www.fullviewgarden.com/cms/info.php?mod=list\"</ | \\><plaintext/onmouseover=prompt ( /XSS/ ) >  ，   ， Solution  ，  ， For a prevention of Cross Site Scripting , some measures should be considered :   ， Never enter untrusted data except in locations defined for this purpose.  ， The principle of this rule is to deny everything and mostly do not JavaScript code from an unknown source and then run it.  ， Validate the escape characters before inserting them inside the HTML element. Failure to validate inputs may allow malicious code to be injected into the application.  ， Validate URL parameters and check information that sends our HTTP requests , hex escapes us in URLs such as% 25 , aawhere 25 is the ASCII code of the character \"%\".  ， Avoid HTML injection attacks by resorting to libraries that parse the inserted HTML such as : HtmlSanitizer , OWASP Java HTML Sanitizer.  ， Another recommendation to mitigate such security flaws in a web application is an application of a Web Application Firewall ( WAF ) such as ModSecurity , Ironbee and others.",
