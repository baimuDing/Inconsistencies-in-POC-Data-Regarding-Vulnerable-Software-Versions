Bucci <bucci @ sas.upenn.edu>  ， Date : 18 March , 2013  ， CVE-2013-2294  ， Description of Vulnerability :   ，  ， ViewGit \"is a git web repository viewer that aims to be easy to set up  ， and upgrade , light on dependencies , and comfortable to use.\"  ，  ( http : /viewgit.fealdia.org/ ) .  ， ViewGit contains multiple persistent arbitrary script injection ( XSS )   ， vulnerabilities in its \"Shortlog\" and \"Heads\" tables. These  ， vulnerabilities are triggered by malicious data inserted via the branch  ， or tag systems of git by one of the users of the repository.  ， Systems affected :   ，  ， ViewGit 0.0.6 installed on CentOS 6.3 with PHP 5.3.3 and Apache 2.2.15  ， was tested and shown to be vulnerable.  ， Impact :   ，  ， Users viewing the ViewGit web interface could be exposed to arbitrary  ， HTML source authored by an attacker , including malicious Flash or Java  ， objects , remotely sourced iFrame tags , malicious JavaScript , or other  ， content , that would be associated with the trust zone of the ViewGit web  ， interface. This could result in bypass of cross site request forgery  ， mitigation , account compromise , drive by download attacks or other  ， impacts. For more information about the potential impacts of client side  ， attacks see the BeEF Project at http : /beefproject.com/.  ， Mitigating factors :   ，  ， In order to inject arbitrary script , attackers must have the ability to  ， manipulate the git repository. Specifically , the attacker must be able  ， to create branches or tags.",
