    "text": "title : Dropbear SSHD xauth Command Injection / Bypass  ， detail : Dropbear sshd versions 2015.71 and below suffer from a command injection vulnerability via xauth. An authenticated user may inject arbitrary xauth commands by sending an x11 channel request that includes a newline character in the x11 cookie. The newline acts as a command separator to the xauth binary. This attack requires the server to have 'X11Forwarding yes' enabled. Disabling it , mitigates this vector.  ， cve : advisories | CVE-2016-3116  ，  ， desc : Author : <github.com/tintinweb>  ， Ref : https : /github.com/tintinweb/pub/tree/master/pocs/cve-2016-3116  ， Version : 0.2  ， Date : Mar 3rd , 2016  ， Tag : dropbearsshd xauth command injection may lead to forced-command bypass  ， Overview  ，  ， Name : dropbear  ， Vendor : Matt Johnston  ， References :  * https : /matt.ucc.asn.au/dropbear/dropbear.html [ 1 ]   ， Version : 2015.71  ， Latest Version : 2015.71  ， Other Versions : <= 2015.71 ( basically all versions with x11fwd support ; v0.44 ~ 11 years )   ， Platform ( s )  : linux  ， Technology : c  ， Vuln Classes : CWE-93 - Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences ( 'CRLF Injection' )   ， Origin : remote  ， Min. Privs. : post auth  ， CVE : CVE-2016-3116  ， Description  ，  ， quote website [ 1 ]   ， >Dropbear is a relatively small SSH server and client. It runs on a variety of POSIX-based platforms. Dropbear is open source software , distributed under a MIT-style license. Dropbear is particularly useful for \"embedded\"-type Linux ( or other Unix ) systems , such as wireless routers.  ， Summary  ，  ， An authenticated user may inject arbitrary xauth commands by sending an  ， x11 channel request that includes a newline character in the x11 cookie.  ， The newline acts as a command separator to the xauth binary. This attack requires  ， the server to have 'X11Forwarding yes' enabled. Disabling it , mitigates this vector.  ， By injecting xauth commands one gains limited * read/write arbitrary files ,   ， information leakage or xauth-connect capabilities. These capabilities can be  ， leveraged by an authenticated restricted user - e.g. one with configured forced-commands - to bypass  ， account restriction. This is generally not expected.  ， The injected xauth commands are performed with the effective permissions of the  ， logged in user as the sshd already dropped its privileges.  ， Quick-Info :   ，  * requires : X11Forwarding yes  ，  * does * NOT * bypass /bin/false due to special treatment ( like nologin )   ，  * bypasses forced-commands ( allows arbitr. read/write )   ， Capabilities ( xauth )  :   ，  * Xauth",
