    "text": "title : Samba chain_reply Memory Corruption ( Linux x86 )   ， detail : This exploits a memory corruption vulnerability present in Samba versions prior to 3.3.13. When handling chained response packets , Samba fails to validate the offset value used when building the next part. By setting this value to a number larger than the destination buffer size , an attacker can corrupt memory. Additionally , setting this value to a value smaller than 'smb_wct' ( 0x24 ) will cause the header of the input buffer chunk to be corrupted. After close inspection , it appears that 3.0.x versions of Samba are not exploitable. Since they use an \"InputBuffer\" size of 0x20441 , an attacker cannot cause memory to be corrupted in an exploitable way. It is possible to corrupt the heap header of the \"InputBuffer\" , but it didn't seem possible to get the chunk to be processed again prior to process exit. In order to gain code execution , this exploit attempts to overwrite a \"talloc chunk\" destructor function pointer. This particular module is capable of exploiting the flaw on x86 Linux systems that do not have the nx memory protection. NOTE : It is possible to make exploitation attempts indefinitely since Samba forks for user sessions in the default configuration.  ， cve : advisories | CVE-2010-2063  ，  ， desc :  #   ，  #  $ Id : chain_reply.rb 9852 2010-07-17 01 : 28 : 27Z jduck $   ，   ，  # This file is part of the Metasploit Framework and may be subject to  ，  # redistribution and commercial restrictions.
