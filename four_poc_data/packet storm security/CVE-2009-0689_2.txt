    "text": "title : J 6.02.023 Array Overrun  ， detail : J version 6.02.023 suffers from an array overrun vulnerability.  ， cve : advisories | CVE-2009-0689  ，  ， desc :  [ J 6.02.023 Array Overrun ( code execution )  ]   ， Author : Maksymilian Arciemowicz and sp3x  ， http : /SecurityReason.com  ， Date :   ， - Dis. : 07.05.2009  ， - Pub. : 08.01.2010  ， CVE : CVE-2009-0689  ， CWE : CWE-119  ， Risk : High  ， Remote : Yes  ， Affected Software :   ， - J 6.02.023 Array Overrun ( code execution )   ， NOTE : Prior versions may also be affected.  ， Original URL :   ， http : /securityreason.com/achievement_securityalert/79  ， - 0.Description -  ， The J programming language , developed in the early 1990s by Ken Iverson  ， and Roger Hui , is a synthesis of APL ( also by Iverson ) and the FP and FL  ， function-level languages created by John Backus.  ， To avoid repeating the APL special character problem , J requires only  ， the basic ASCII character set , resorting to the use of digraphs formed  ， using the dot or colon characters to extend the meaning of the basic  ， characters available. Additionally , to keep parsing and the language  ， simple , and to compensate for the lack of character variation in ASCII ,   ， J treats many characters which might need to be balanced in other  ， languages ( such as [  ] {} \" ` or <> ) as stand alone tokens or ( with  ， digraphs ) treats them as part of a multi-character token.  ， Being an array programming language , J is very terse and powerful , and  ， is most suited to mathematical and statistical programming , especially  ， when performing operations on matrices. J is a MIMD language.  ， - 1. J 6.02.023 Array Overrun ( code execution ) -  ， The main problem exist in dtoa implementation. J has the same dtoa as  ， MatLab , OpenBSD , MacOS , Google , Opera etc.  ， and it is the same like SREASONRES : 20090625.  ， http : /securityreason.com/achievement_securityalert/63  ， but fix for SREASONRES : 20090625 , used by openbsd was not good.  ， More information about fix for openbsd and similars SREASONRES : 20091030 ,   ， http : /securityreason.com/achievement_securityalert/69  ， We can create any number of float , which will overwrite the memory. In  ， Kmax has defined 15. Functions in dtoa , don't checks Kmax limit , and it  ， is possible to call 16 <= elements of freelist array.  ， - 2. Proof of Concept ( PoC ) -  ， There are several ways to make a successful attack. Simplest assumed the  ， creation of a script with a defective floating-point variable and  ， execution it. This will allow the possibility of code execution.  ， -expl.ijs-",
