    "text": "title : Mozilla Firefox 7 / 8 Out-Of-Bounds Access  ， detail : This Metasploit module exploits an out-of-bounds access flaw in Firefox 7 and 8 ( versions 8.0.1 and below ) . The notification of nsSVGValue observers via nsSVGValue : NotifyObservers ( x , y ) uses a loop which can result in an out-of-bounds access to attacker-controlled memory. The mObserver ElementAt (  ) function ( which picks up pointers )  , does not validate if a given index is out of bound. If a custom observer of nsSVGValue is created , which removes elements from the original observer , and memory layout is manipulated properly , the ElementAt (  ) function might pick up an attacker provided pointer , which can be leveraged to gain remote arbitrary code execution.  ， cve : advisories | CVE-2011-3658  ，  ， desc :  #   ，  # This file is part of the Metasploit Framework and may be subject to  ，  # redistribution and commercial restrictions.
