    "text": "title : SuiteCRM 7.11.18 Remote Code Execution  ， detail : This Metasploit module exploits an input validation error on the log file extension parameter of SuiteCRM version 7.11.18. It does not properly validate upper/lower case characters. Once this occurs , the application log file will be treated as a php file. The log file can then be populated with php code by changing the username of a valid user , as this info is logged. The php code in the file can then be executed by sending an HTTP request to the log file. A similar issue was reported by the same researcher where a blank file extension could be supplied and the extension could be provided in the file name. This exploit will work on those versions as well , and those references are included.  ， cve : advisories | CVE-2020-28328 , CVE-2021-42840  ，  ， desc :  #   ，  # This module requires Metasploit : https : /metasploit.com/download  ，  # Current source : https : /github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework  ，   ， 'Description' => %q{  ， This module exploits an input validation error on the log file extension parameter.
