If successful , it plants a JSP-based backdoor in the public web directory , then executes that backdoor. The core vulnerability is a path-traversal issue in the cpio command-line utility that can extract an arbitrary file to an arbitrary location on a Linux system ( CVE-2015-1197 ) . Most Linux distros have chosen not to fix it. This issue is exploitable on Red Hat-based systems ( and other hosts without pax installed ) running versions Zimbra Collaboration Suite 9.0.0 Patch 26 and below and Zimbra Collaboration Suite 8.8.15 Patch 33 and below.  ， cve : advisories | CVE-2015-1197 , CVE-2022-41352  ，  ， desc :  #   ，  # This module requires Metasploit : https : /metasploit.com/download  ，  # Current source : https : /github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework  ，   ， 'Description' => %q{  ， This module creates a .tar file that can be emailed to a Zimbra server  ， to exploit CVE-2022-41352.
