    "text": "title : Firefox 15.0.1 Code Execution  ， detail : On versions of Firefox from 5.0 to 15.0.1 , the InstallTrigger global , when given invalid input , would throw an exception that did not have an _exposedProps_ property set. By re-setting this property on the exception object's prototype , the chrome-based defineProperty method is made available. With the defineProperty method , functions belonging to window and document can be overriden with a function that gets called from chrome-privileged context. From here , another vulnerability in the crypto.generateCRMFRequest function is used to \"peek\" into the context's private scope. Since the window does not have a chrome : / URL , the insecure parts of Components.classes are not available , so instead the AddonManager API is invoked to silently install a malicious plugin.  ， cve : advisories | CVE-2012-3993 , CVE-2013-1710 , OSVDB-86111 , OSVDB-96019  ，  ， desc :  #   ，  # This module requires Metasploit : http/metasploit.com/download  ，  # Current source : https : /github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework  ，  ， require 'msf/core'",
