    "text": "title : GitLab File Read Remote Code Execution  ， detail : This Metasploit module provides remote code execution against GitLab Community Edition ( CE ) and Enterprise Edition ( EE ) . It combines an arbitrary file read to extract the Rails secret_key_base , and gains remote code execution with a deserialization vulnerability of a signed experimentation_subject_id cookie that GitLab uses internally for A/B testing. Note that the arbitrary file read exists in GitLab EE/CE 8.5 and later , and was fixed in 12.9.1 , 12.8.8 , and 12.7.8. However , the RCE only affects versions 12.4.0 and above when the vulnerable experimentation_subject_id cookie was introduced. Tested on GitLab 12.8.1 and 12.4.0.  ， cve : advisories | CVE-2020-10977  ，  ， desc :  #   ，  # This module requires Metasploit : https : /metasploit.com/download  ，  # Current source : https : /github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework  ，   ， 'Description' => %q{  ， This module provides remote code execution against GitLab Community  ， Edition ( CE ) and Enterprise Edition ( EE ) .
