It can  ， also be used as a denail of service against kadmind.  ， root 1834 1 0 22 : 29 ? 00 : 00 : 00 /usr/kerberos/sbin/krb5kdc  ， root 6600 1 0 23 : 00 ? 00 : 00 : 00 /usr/kerberos/sbin/kadmind  ， To trigger the exploit , a valid user account has to first of all authenticate to the Kerberos service and have a ticket  ， generated , the user therefor must be or have access to an admin account that can access thre remote kadmind  ， service , which limits the scope of the attack slightly. However , this still allows anyone with the most limited access  ， to the service to kill it or gain root access and as such should be treated as critical.  ， A trivial issue encountered was that the kadmin client would filter out crazy strings passed to it , so you can't use it  ， by default to send in shellcode and return addresses. To get around that we modify the client source code a bit to  ， honour our malicious values and then upload it to our user directory , and as if by magic it will no longer bail when it  ， encounters these strings ;  )   ， Following is the vulnerable function with the unused code , ifdefs and comments removed to make it easier to read  ， / * krb5-1.5.1/src/lib/kadm5/logger.c  ， static int",
