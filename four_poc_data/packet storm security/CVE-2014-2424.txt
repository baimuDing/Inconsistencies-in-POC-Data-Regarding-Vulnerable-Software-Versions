    "text": "title : Oracle Event Processing FileUploadServlet Arbitrary File Upload  ， detail : This Metasploit module exploits an Arbitrary File Upload vulnerability in Oracle Event Processing 11.1.1.7.0. The FileUploadServlet component , which requires no authentication , can be abused to upload a malicious file onto an arbitrary location due to a directory traversal flaw , and compromise the server. By default Oracle Event Processing uses a Jetty Application Server without JSP support , which limits the attack to WbemExec. The current WbemExec technique only requires arbitrary write to the file system , but at the moment the module only supports Windows 2003 SP2 or older.  ， cve : advisories | CVE-2014-2424  ，  ， desc :  #   ，  # This module requires Metasploit : http/metasploit.com/download  ，  # Current source : https : /github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework  ，  ， require 'msf/core'",
