The scripts that process configuration changes do not  ， require authentication and therefore can be altered _remotely_ via simple form submissions written  ， in HTML and submitted using JavaScript. Please refer to the bottom of this text for my previous  ， findings and the demo page with sample exploits.  ， + | Let's Get Dirty  ，  ， You may find my original demonstration page at https : /kinqpinz.info/lib/wrt54g/. It basically shows  ， how forms can be constructed in HTML that take advantage of the major flaws present within the  ， insecure router. In my previous documentation I showed how it is possible to alter configuration  ， parameters both via Linux command line using curl and HTML form submissions. In this text I  ， demonstrate how to do these very same things transparently using a combination of HTML form  ， construction with JavaScript that automagically submits our desired changes.  ， The JavaScript is simple and is only used for submitting the form - a user-free mechanism that will  ， redirect the user to their router and prompts them to log in. Once again , THE REQUEST TO  ， AUTHENTICATE TO THE DEVICE IS NOT REQUIRED IN ORDER TO CHANGE ITS SETTINGS. The following is all  ， that is required in order to submit our form that will be constructed using GET parameters observed  ， from the device's Web interface.  ， document.f.submit (  )  ;   ， This submits forms hidden within the Webpage. Our first example code enables wireless access with an  ， SSID of our choosing. In this instance , I will use the SSID \"kinqpinz\".",
