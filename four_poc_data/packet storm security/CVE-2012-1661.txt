    "text": "date_time:Jun 14, 2012 ， title:ESRI ArcMap Arbitrary Code Execution  ， detail:ESRI ArcMap suffers from an arbitrary code execution vulnerability when handling a specially crafted map file.  ， cve:advisories | CVE-2012-1661  ， date_time:Jun 14, 2012  ， desc:Description:  ， Opening a specially crafted mxd file will execute arbitrary  ， code without prompting and without a crash of the application.  ， This is due to a flaw in the programs ability to prompt a user  ， before executing embedded VBA. Mxd files are not filtered by  ， email systems so this allows a remote attacker to trick a user  ， into opening a map file via email and unknowingly gain control  ， over their system.  ， Versions affected (maybe more):  ， ArcMap 9  ， ArcGIS Desktop 10  ， Release Version: 10.0  ， Product Version: 10.0.1.2800  ， ArcGIS Service Pack: 1 (build 10.0.1.2800)  ， ArcGIS Desktop 10  ， Release Version: 10.0  ， Product Version: 10.0.2.3200  ， ArcGIS Service Pack: 2 (build 10.0.2.3200)"
