    "text": "title : vmwgfx Driver File Descriptor Handling Privilege Escalation  ， detail : If the vmwgfx driver fails to copy the fence_rep object to userland , it tries to recover by deallocating the ( already populated ) file descriptor. This is wrong , as the fd gets released via put_unused_fd (  ) which shouldn't be used , as the fd table slot was already populated via the previous call to fd_install (  ) . This leaves userland with a valid fd table entry pointing to a freed file object. The authors use this bug to overwrite a SUID binary with their payload and gain root. Linux kernel versions 4.14-rc1 - 5.17-rc1 are vulnerable. Successfully tested against Ubuntu 22.04.01 with kernel 5.13.12-051312-generic.  ， cve : advisories | CVE-2022-22942  ，  ， desc :  #   ，  # This module requires Metasploit : https : /metasploit.com/download  ，  # Current source : https : /github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework  ，   ， 'Description' => %q{  ， If the vmwgfx driver fails to copy the 'fence_rep' object to userland , it tries to  ， recover by deallocating the ( already populated ) file descriptor.
