The garbage  ， collector code will use this data as a virtual function table ( vftable )   ， in order  ， to make a virtual function call. An attacker has enough control over  ， this data  ， to allow execution of arbitrary code.  ， Known affected software and attack vectors  ，  ， + * Microsoft Internet Explorer 11 *  ( all versions before the June 2016  ， patch )   ， An attacker would need to get a target user to open a specially crafted  ， webpage. Disabling JavaScript should prevent an attacker from  ， triggering the  ， vulnerable code path.  ， Repro",
