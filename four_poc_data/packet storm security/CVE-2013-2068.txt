    "text": "title : Red Hat CloudForms Management Engine 5.1 agent/linuxpkgs Path Traversal  ， detail : This Metasploit module exploits a path traversal vulnerability in the \"linuxpkgs\" action of \"agent\" controller of the Red Hat CloudForms Management Engine 5.1 ( ManageIQ Enterprise Virtualization Manager 5.0 and earlier ) . It uploads a fake controller to the controllers directory of the Rails application with the encoded payload as an action and sends a request to this action to execute the payload. Optionally , it can also upload a routing file containing a route to the action. ( Which is not necessary , since the application already contains a general default route. )   ， cve : advisories | CVE-2013-2068  ，  ， desc :  #   ，  # This module requires Metasploit : http/metasploit.com/download  ，  # Current source : https : /github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework  ，  ， require 'msf/core'",
