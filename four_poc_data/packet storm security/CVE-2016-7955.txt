    "text": "title : Alienvault OSSIM / USM 5.3.0 Authentication Bypass  ， detail : Alienvault OSSIM / USM versions 5.3.0 and below suffer from an authentication bypass vulnerability.  ， cve : advisories | CVE-2016-7955  ，  ， desc : Details  ，  ， Product : Alienvault OSSIM/USM  ， Vulnerability : Authentication Bypass  ， Author : Peter Lapp , lappsec (  ) gmail com  ， CVE : CVE-2016-7955  ， Vulnerable Versions : <= 5.3.0  ， Fixed Version : 5.3.1  ， Vulnerability Details  ，  ， This vulnerability allows remote attackers to bypass authentication  ， requirements on vulnerable installations of AlienVault Unified  ， Security Manager. Authentication is not required to exploit this  ， vulnerability.  ， The specific flaw exists within the logcheck function in session.inc.  ， By providing a specific value as a user-agent , an attacker can bypass  ， authentication to a number of pages. In addition to viewing  ， information , it's possible to modify the application and achieve  ， arbitrary code execution as root.  ， References  ，  ， http : /www.zerodayinitiative.com/advisories/ZDI-16-517/  ， https : /www.alienvault.com/forums/discussion/7765/alienvault-v5-3-1-hotfix  ， POC  ，  ， The python script below was cobbled together to demonstrate the use of  ， this vulnerability to gain command execution as root. The script uses  ， the vulnerability to retrieve the engine ID ( CTX )  , create an email  ， action , change the email action to an exec action with the payload ,   ， and then creates a policy that triggers that action on ANY event.  ， It will work against any USM instance without a hitch , but will only  ， work against OSSIM if there is some sort of action already created.  ， Because of the way OSSIM handles engine ID's and the lack of a  ， session , it's not possible to retrieve the engine ID required to  ， create an action.  ， This is just a POC so use at your own risk.",
