Impact on Business  ，  ， By exploiting this vulnerability a remote unauthenticated attacker would be  ， able to overwrite sensitive business data stored on the remote system.  ， Risk Level: High  ， 2. Advisory Information  ，  ， - - Public Release Date: 2015-02-25  ， - - Subscriber Notification Date: 2015-02-25  ， - - Last Revised: 2015-02-25  ， - - Security Advisory ID: ONAPSIS-2015-003  ， - - Onapsis SVS ID: ONAPSIS-00109  ， - - CVE: CVE-2015-2074  ， - - Researcher: Will Vandevanter  ， - - Initial Base CVSS v2: 6.4 (AV:N/AC:L/AU:N/C:N/I:P/A:P)  ， 3. Vulnerability Information  ，  ， - - Vendor: SAP  ， - - Affected Components:  ， - BussinessObjects Edge 4.0  ， (Check SAP Note 2018681 for detailed information on affected releases)  ， - - Vulnerability Class: External Control of File Name or Path (CWE-73)  ， - - Remotely Exploitable: Yes  ， - - Locally Exploitable: No  ， - - Authentication Required: No  ， - - Original Advisory:  ， http:/www.onapsis.com/research/security-advisories/sap-business-objects-unauthorized-file-repository-server-write-via-corba  ， 4. Affected Components Description  ，  ， Business Objects is part of the Business Intelligence platform from SAP.  ， It has components that provide performance management, planning,  ， reporting, query and analysis and enterprise information management.  ， Every Business Objects installation provides a web service to interact  ， with different platform services.  ， 5. Vulnerability Details  ，  ， The BusinessObjects File Repositoy Server (FRS) CORBA listener allows  ， the writing of any file stored in the FRS without authentication. If the  ， attacker wishes to overwrite a file, the only requirement is that the  ， user know the name of the file in the FRS. For example,  ， frs:/Input/a_103/019/000/4967/1b14796c5b0d5f2c.rpt. With  ， knowledge of this filename, the user can write the file remotely without  ， authentication.  ， Note, using CORBA it is also possible to test if a directory or file  ， exists on the file system. Therefore, although unlikely, an attacker  ， could guess directories and then filenames brute-forcing files to  ， overwrite. This would be considerably easier with a predictable file  ， naming convention.  ， 6. Solution  ，  ， SAP has released SAP Note 2018681 which provides patched versions of the  ， affected components.  ， The patches can be downloaded from  ， https:/service.sap.com/sap/support/notes/2018681  ， Onapsis strongly recommends SAP customers to download the related  ， security fixes and apply them to the affected components in order to  ， reduce business risks."
