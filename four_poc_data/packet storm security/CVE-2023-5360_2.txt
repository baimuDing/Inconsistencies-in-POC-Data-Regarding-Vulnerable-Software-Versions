    "text": "title : WordPress Royal Elementor 1.3.78 Shell Upload  ， detail : WordPress Royal Elementor plugin versions 1.3.78 and below suffer from a remote shell upload vulnerability.  ， cve : advisories | CVE-2023-5360  ，  ， desc : Today , on October 13 , 2023 , the Wordfence Threat Intelligence Team became aware of a vulnerability that was recently patched in Royal Elementor Addons and Templates , a WordPress plugin installed on over 200 , 000 sites , that makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to upload arbitrary files to vulnerable sites.  ， This allows unauthenticated attackers to upload PHP files containing malicious content , such as a backdoor , that makes remote code execution possible and leads to a complete compromise of the site. We have blocked over 46 , 169 attacks targeting this vulnerability in the past 30 days , and reviewing our data revealed that attacks started on or around August 30th , 2023 , though we also have evidence that the exploit was being actively developed as early as July 27 , 2023.  ， All Wordfence users running Premium , Care , or Response , as well as those still running the free version of the Wordfence plugin , are protected by the Wordfence firewalls built in malicious file upload protection. However , we still strongly encourage users to ensure their sites are updated to the latest patched version of the plugin which is 1.3.79 due to the fact that this vulnerability is being actively exploited.  ， This vulnerability was originally discovered by Fioravante Souza from WPScan , and you can find all applicable references in the Wordfence Intelligence Database.  ， Description : Royal Elementor Addons and Templates <= 1.3.78 Unauthenticated Arbitrary File Upload  ， Affected Plugin : Royal Elementor Addons and Templates  ， Plugin slug : royal-elementor-addons  ， Vendor : WP Royal  ， Affected versions : <= 1.3.78  ， CVE ID : CVE-2023-5360  ， CVSS Score : 9.8 ( Critical )   ， CVSS Vector : CVSS : 3.1/AV : N/AC : L/PR : N/UI : N/S : U/C : H/I : H/A : H  ， Researcher : Fioravante Souza ( WPScan )   ， Fully Patched Version : 1.3.79  ， Wordfence Intelligence Reference  ， The Royal Elementor Addons and Templates plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads in all versions up to , and including , 1.3.78. This is due to insufficient file type validation in the handle_file_upload (  ) function called via AJAX which allows attackers to supply a preferred filetype extension to the allowed_file_types parameter , with a special character , which makes it possible for the uploaded file to bypass their filter list. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to upload arbitrary files on the affected sites server which may make remote code execution possible.  ， Due to the fact that this vulnerability is being actively exploited , we are keeping information about the technical specifications of this vulnerability limited.  ， Indicators of Compromise  ， Our earliest indicator that this vulnerability was targeted was on August 30th , well before the vulnerability was patched , however , we only see a few attacks here and there around the early days with attacks starting to ramp up later around October 3rd , 2023. In the past 30 days , we have blocked over 46 , 169 attacks.  ， A majority of the attacks appear to be coming from just the following three IP Addresses :   ， - 65.21.22.78 with 33 , 255 attacks blocked.  ， - 2a01 : 4f9 : 3080 : 4eea : 2 with 12 , 289 attacks blocked.  ， - 135.181.181.50 with 206 attacks blocked.  ， >From our data , it appears that attackers have been attempting to place files named b1ack [ . ] p $ hp , which has an md5 hash of 1635f34d9c1da30ff5438e06d3ea6590 and can be used to place additional PHP files on the site , as well as wp.ph $ p which has an md5 hash of bac83f216eba23a865c591dbea427f22 and inserts a malicious administrator. The Wordfence scanner has had detection for b1ack [ . ] p $ hp since December 2019 , and we have written a signature to detect wp [ . ] ph $ p which will be released as soon as it passes our quality assurance process.",
