( formerly Apple Computer , Inc. ) for their Macintosh line of computer systems. The Macintosh user experience is credited with popularizing the graphical user interface. The original form of what Apple would later name the \"Mac OS\" was the integral and unnamed system software first introduced in 1984 with the original Macintosh , usually referred to simply as the System software.  ， - - 1. MacOS X 10.5/10.6 libc/strtod ( 3 ) buffer overflow -  ， The main problem exist in dtoa implementation. MacOS X has the same dtoa as OpenBSD , NetBSD etc. This problem affects not only libc/gdtoa. Affected is also strtod ( 3 ) function.  ， For more information , please see SREASONRES : 20090625.  ， http : /securityreason.com/achievement_securityalert/63  ， but fix for SREASONRES : 20090625 , used by openbsd was not good.  ， More information about fix for openbsd and similars SREASONRES : 20091030 ,   ， http : /securityreason.com/achievement_securityalert/69  ， We can create any number of float , which will overwrite the memory. In  ， Kmax has defined 15. Functions in dtoa , don't checks Kmax limit , and  ， it is possible to call 16 <= elements of freelist array.  ， It is true that the examples presented in the previous notes , using the printf ( 1 ) do not work under MacOS X. This does not mean the MacOSX C library is safe.  ， More :   ， http : /cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/119.html  ， - - 2.
