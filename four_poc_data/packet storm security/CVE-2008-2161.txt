    "text": "title : OpenTFTP SP 1.4 Error Packet Overflow  ， detail : This Metasploit module exploits a buffer overflow in OpenTFTP Server SP 1.4. The vulnerable condition triggers when the TFTP opcode is configured as an error packet , the TFTP service will then format the message using a sprintf (  ) function , which causes an overflow , therefore allowing remote code execution under the context of SYSTEM. The offset ( to EIP ) is specific to how the TFTP was started ( as a 'Stand Alone' , or 'Service' ) . By default the target is set to 'Service' because that's the default configuration during OpenTFTP Server SP 1.4's installation.  ， cve : advisories | CVE-2008-2161  ，  ， desc :  #   ，  # This file is part of the Metasploit Framework and may be subject to  ，  # redistribution and commercial restrictions.
