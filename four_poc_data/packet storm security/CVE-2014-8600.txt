KDE  ， CVE : CVE-2014-8600  ， Vendor : KDE e.V.  ， Product : KDE  ， Affected version : kwebkitpart <= 1.3.4 , kde-runtime <= 4.14.3 , kio-extras <= 5.1.1  ， Fixed version : Contact distribution vendor  ， Reported by : T. Brown and D.

It is possible for an attacker to inject JavaScript by manipulating IO slave URI such that the JavaScript from the manipulated request is returned in the response. Example IO slaves that trigger this behaviour include :   ， zip  ， trash  ， tar  ， thumbnail  ， smtps  ， smtp  ， smb  ， remote  ， recentdocuments  ， nntps  ， nntp  ， network  ， mbox  ， ldaps  ， ldap  ， fonts  ， file  ， desktop  ， cgi  ， bookmarks  ， ar  ， The following code will trigger all vulnerable IO slaves : ",
