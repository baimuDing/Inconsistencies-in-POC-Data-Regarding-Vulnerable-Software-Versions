    "text": "title : Splunk XSLT Upload Remote Code Execution  ， detail : This Metasploit module exploits a remote code execution vulnerability in Splunk Enterprise. The affected versions include 9.0.x before 9.0.7 and 9.1.x before 9.1.2. The exploitation process leverages a weakness in the XSLT transformation functionality of Splunk. Successful exploitation requires valid credentials , typically admin : changeme by default. The exploit involves uploading a malicious XSLT file to the target system. This file , when processed by the vulnerable Splunk server , leads to the execution of arbitrary code. The module then utilizes the runshellscript capability in Splunk to execute the payload , which can be tailored to establish a reverse shell. This provides the attacker with remote control over the compromised Splunk instance. The module is designed to work seamlessly , ensuring successful exploitation under the right conditions.  ， cve : advisories | CVE-2023-46214  ，  ， desc :  #   ，  # This module requires Metasploit : https : /metasploit.com/download  ，  # Current source : https : /github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework  ，   ， 'Description' => %q{  ， This Metasploit module exploits a Remote Code Execution ( RCE ) vulnerability in Splunk Enterprise.  ， The affected versions include 9.0.x before 9.0.7 and 9.1.x before 9.1.2.
