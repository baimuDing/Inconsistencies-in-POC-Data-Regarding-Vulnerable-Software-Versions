At worst , if DEP is enabled for the Apache process , you could cause  ，  * a constant DoS by looping this ( since apache will automatically restart )  :  )   ，  ，  * Note that the exploit code may need to be run multiple times before a shell is spawned ( 70%  ，  * success rate - tested on three different systems ) . Furthermore , the exploit code may require  ，  * modification to exploit this vulnerability on different platforms. This is due to loaded memory  ，  * references to the unloaded DLL ( they will be different for each ISAPI module ) . Do not test  ，  * this code in a VM otherwise the code may fail to send the RESET packet ( something to do with  ，  * VMware gracefully closing the connection , instead of sending a RESET packet ) - I didnt want  ，  * to have to use raw packets on Windows.",
