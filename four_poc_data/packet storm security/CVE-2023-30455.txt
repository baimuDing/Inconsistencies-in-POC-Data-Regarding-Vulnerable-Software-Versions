    "text": "title : ebankIT 6 Denial Of Service  ， detail : ebankIT versions prior to 7 suffer from a denial of service vulnerability.  ， cve : advisories | CVE-2023-30455  ，  ， desc : CVE-2023-30455  ，  [ Description ]   ， An issue was discovered in ebankIT before version 7.  ， A Denial-of-Service attack is possible through the GET parameter  ， EStatementsIds located on the  ， /Controls/Generic/EBMK/Handlers/EStatements/DownloadEStatement.ashx endpoint.  ， The GET parameter accepts over 100 comma-separated e-statement IDs  ， without throwing an error. When this many IDs are supplied , the server  ， takes around 60 seconds to respond and successfully generate the  ， expected ZIP archive ( during this time period , no other pages load ) . A  ， threat actor could issue a request to this endpoint with 100+ statement  ， IDs every 30 seconds , potentially resulting in an overload of the  ， server for all users.  ，  ，  [ VulnerabilityType Other ]   ， Denial of Service  ，  ，  [ Vendor of Product ]   ， ebankIT  ，  ，  [ Affected Product Code Base ]   ， ebankIT - Omnichannel Digital Banking Platform - Version 6 , patched in version 7  ，  ，  [ Affected Component ]   ， The endpoint existing at /Controls/Generic/EBMK/Handlers/EStatements/DownloadEStatement.ashx?EStatementsIds= * id *  ,  * id *  ,  * id *  , etc  ，  ，  [ Attack Type ]   ， Remote  ，  ，  [ Impact Denial of Service ]   ， true  ，  ，  [ Attack Vectors ]   ， I discovered it was possible to perform a Denial-of-Service attack on  ， the ebankIT platform , potentially resulting in a single user rendering  ， the entire application inaccessible. The vulnerable endpoint exists on  ， /Controls/Generic/EBMK/Handlers/EStatements/DownloadEStatement.ashx  ， and the EStatementsIds GET parameter accepts over 100  ， comma-separated e-statement IDs without throwing an error. When this  ， many IDs are supplied , the server takes around 60 seconds to respond  ， and successfully generate the expected zip file ( during this 60  ， seconds , no other pages load ) . A threat actor could issue a request to  ， this endpoint with 100+ statement ID s every 30 seconds , potentially  ， resulting in overloading the server for all users of the ebankIT  ， platform. I believe this is being caused by a thread commitment issue  ， where there are no dedicated threads to individual processes.  ，  ，  [ Discoverer ]   ， Jake Murphy",
