Once uploaded to the server , depending on server configuration ,   ， the attacker can access the malicious PNG file via HTTP or HTTPS , thereby executing the malicious PHP code and  ， gaining access to the system.  ， This vulnerability does not require authentication because there is a missing authentication check in the  ， loadUser (  ) method in include/MVC/SugarApplication.php. After a failed login , the session does not get  ， destroyed and hence the attacker can continue to send valid requests to the application.  ， Because of this , any remote attacker , regardless of authentication , can exploit this vulnerability to gain  ， access to the underlying operating system as the user that the web services are running as ( typically www-data ) .  ， }",
