BACKGROUND  ，  ， vBulletin ( vB ) is a proprietary Internet forum software package developed by  ， vBulletin Solutions , Inc. , a division of Internet Brands.  ， https : /www.vbulletin.com/  ， https : /en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VBulletin  ， A google search for \"Powered by vBulletin\" returns over 19 million sites  ， that are hosting a vBulletin forum :   ， https : /www.google.co.uk/?gws_rd=ssl # q=%22Powered+by+vBulletin%22  ， III. INTRODUCTION  ，  ， vBulletin forum software is affected by a SSRF vulnerability that allows  ， unauthenticated remote attackers to access internal services ( such as mail  ， servers , memcached , couchDB , zabbix etc. ) running on the server hosting  ， vBulletin as well as services on other servers on the local network that are  ， accessible from the target.  ， This advisory provides a PoC exploit that demonstrates how an unauthenticated  ， attacker could perform a port scan of the internal services as well as execute  ， arbitrary system commands on a target vBulletin host with a locally installed  ， Zabbix Agent monitoring service.  ， IV. DESCRIPTION  ，  ， vBulletin allows forum users to share media fiels by uploading them to the  ， remote server. Some pages allow users to specify a URL to a media file  ， that a user wants to share which will then be retrieved by vBulletin.  ， The user-provided links are validated to make sure that users can only access  ， resources from HTTP/HTTPS protocols and that connections are not allowed in to  ， the localhost.",
