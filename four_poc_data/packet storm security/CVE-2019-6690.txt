    "text": "title : Python GnuPG 0.4.3 Improper Input Validation  ， detail : Researchers discovered a way to inject data through the passphrase property of the gnupg.GPG.encrypt (  ) and gnupg.GPG.decrypt (  ) methods when symmetric encryption is used. The supplied passphrase is not validated for newlines , and the library passes -passphrase-fd=0 to the gpg executable , which expects the passphrase on the first line of stdin , and the ciphertext to be decrypted or plaintext to be encrypted on subsequent lines. By supplying a passphrase containing a newline an attacker can control/modify the ciphertext/plaintext being decrypted/encrypted. Proof of concept exploit included. Version 0.4.3 is affected.  ， cve : advisories | CVE-2019-6690  ，  ， desc : ",
