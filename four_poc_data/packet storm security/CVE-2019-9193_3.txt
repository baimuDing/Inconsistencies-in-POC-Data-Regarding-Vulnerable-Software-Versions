    "text": "title : PostgreSQL COPY FROM PROGRAM Command Execution  ， detail : Installations running Postgres 9.3 and above have functionality which allows for the superuser and users with 'pg_execute_server_program' to pipe to and from an external program using COPY. This allows arbitrary command execution as though you have console access. This module attempts to create a new table , then execute system commands in the context of copying the command output into the table. This Metasploit module should work on all Postgres systems running version 9.3 and above. For Linux and OSX systems , target 1 is used with cmd payloads such as : cmd/unix/reverse_perl. For Windows Systems , target 2 is used with powershell payloads such as : cmd/windows/powershell_reverse_tcp. Alternatively target 3 can be used to execute generic commands , such as a web_delivery meterpreter powershell payload or other customized command.  ， cve : advisories | CVE-2019-9193  ，  ， desc :  #   ，  # This module requires Metasploit : https : /metasploit.com/download  ，  # Current source : https : /github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework  ，  ， require 'msf/core/exploit/postgres'",
