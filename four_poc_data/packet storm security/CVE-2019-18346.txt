    "text": "title : DAViCal CalDAV Server 1.1.8 Cross Site Request Forgery  ， detail : DAViCal CalDAV Server versions 1.1.8 and below suffer from a cross site request forgery vulnerability.  ， cve : advisories | CVE-2019-18346  ，  ， desc : Original text at :   ， https : /hackdefense.com/publications/cve-2019-18346-davical-caldav-server-vulnerability/  ， At HackDefense , we were evaluating various calendaring solutions , and  ， during installation and configuration of DAViCal we discovered three  ，  ( severe ) vulnerabilities. We reported these vulnerabilities to the  ， vendor. Unfortunately , the DAViCal project itself was not able to fix  ， these vulnerabilities. As DAViCal is an open source project we decided  ， to contribute patches for these vulnerabilities ourselves. DAViCal has  ， accepted our patches in the 1.1.9.1 release. If you use DAViCal as a  ， calendaring server , we recommend upgrading to version 1.1.9.1  ， immediately to remediate the issues weve discovered.  ， All three vulnerabilities exist in the web-based management pages that  ， come with DAViCal. We have written three separate advisories to describe  ， the vulnerabilities :   ， CVE-2019-18345Reflected Cross-Site Scripting  ， CVE-2019-18346 ( this advisory ) Cross-Site Request Forgery  ， CVE-2019-18347 Persistent Cross-Site Scripting  ， CVE Reference : CVE-2019-18346  ， CVSS score : 8.8  ， CVSS vector : CVSS : 3.1/AV : N/AC : L/PR : N/UI : R/S : U/C : H/I : H/A : H  ， About DAViCal  ，  ， DAViCal is a server for calendar sharing. It is an implementation of the  ， CalDAV protocol which is designed for storing calendaring resources on a  ， remote shared server. It can be used by various email and calendaring  ， clients to centrally store and share calendars.  ， It includes a web-based management application. It was in these pages  ， that we discovered this vulnerability.  ， Affected systems  ，  ， DAViCal CalDAV Server 1.1.8 and prior  ， Overview  ，  ， The application has no protection against CSRF attacks. If an  ， authenticated user visits an attacker-controlled webpage ( for example ,   ， in another browser tab )  , the attacker can send arbitrary requests in the  ， name of the user to the application , including requests that result in a  ， state change.  ， For example , if an attacker includes the following HTML code on his/her  ， site and an authenticated DAViCal administrator visits , a new  ， administrative account hacker ( password also hacker ) will  ， automatically be created in the background , giving the attacker full  ， access to the calendaring application : ",
