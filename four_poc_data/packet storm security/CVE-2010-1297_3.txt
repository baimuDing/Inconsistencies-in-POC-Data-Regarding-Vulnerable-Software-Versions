    "text": "title : Adobe Flash Player newfucntion Invalid Pointer Use  ， detail : This Metasploit module exploits a vulnerability in the DoABC tag handling within versions 9.x and 10.0 of Adobe Flash Player. Adobe Reader and Acrobat are also vulnerable , as are any other applications that may embed Flash player. Arbitrary code execution is achieved by embedding a specially crafted Flash movie into a PDF document. An AcroJS heap spray is used in order to ensure that the memory used by the invalid pointer issue is controlled. NOTE : This Metasploit module uses a similar DEP bypass method to that used within the adobe_libtiff module. This method is unlikely to work across various Windows versions due a the hardcoded syscall number.  ， cve : advisories | CVE-2010-1297  ，  ， desc :  #   ，  #  $ Id : adobe_flashplayer_newfunction.rb 9477 2010-06-10 20 : 55 : 17Z jduck $   ，   ，  # This file is part of the Metasploit Framework and may be subject to  ，  # redistribution and commercial restrictions.
