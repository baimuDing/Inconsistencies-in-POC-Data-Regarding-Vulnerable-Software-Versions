However to  ， follows at least some of the responsable disclosure rules , no exploit code will be  ， released. Instead , only a proof-of-concept code is released to demonstrate  ， the vulnerability.  ， regards  ，  ， Paul Starzetz  ， iSEC Security Research  ， http : /isec.pl/  ， Synopsis : Linux kernel ELF core dump privilege elevation  ， Product : Linux kernel  ， Version : 2.2 up to and including 2.2.27-rc2 , 2.4 up to and including  ， 2.4.31-pre1 , 2.6 up to and including 2.6.12-rc4  ， Vendor : http : /www.kernel.org/  ， URL : http : /isec.pl/vulnerabilities/isec-0023-coredump.txt  ， CVE : CAN-2005-1263  ， Severity : local ( 9 )   ， Author : Paul Starzetz <ihaquer @ isec.pl>  ， Date : May 11 , 2005  ， Issue :   ，  ， A locally exploitable flaw has been found in the Linux ELF binary format  ， loader's core dump function that allows local users to gain root  ， privileges and also execute arbitrary code at kernel privilege level.  ， Details :   ，  ， The Linux kernel contains a binary format loader layer to load ( execute )   ， programs in different binary formats like ELF or a.out. Some of the  ， binary format modules like ELF provide an additional function to the  ， kernel layer named core_dump (  ) . The kernel may call this function if a  ， fault ( e.g. memory access error ) occurs during the execution of the  ， binary. The core_dump (  ) function will be called by the kernel , if the  ， process's limit for the core file ( RLIMIT_CORE ) is sufficiently high and  ， the process's binary format supports core dumping.  ， The regular task of the core_dump (  ) function is to create an on disk  ， image of the faulty binary at the moment of the execution fault for  ， debugging purposes. In the case of an ELF binary , the image will contain",
