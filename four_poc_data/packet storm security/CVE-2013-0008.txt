    "text": "title : MS13-005 HWND_BROADCAST Low to Medium Integrity Privilege Escalation  ， detail : The Windows kernel does not properly isolate broadcast messages from low integrity applications from medium or high integrity applications. This allows commands to be broadcasted to an open medium or high integrity command prompts allowing escalation of privileges. We can spawn a medium integrity command prompt , after spawning a low integrity command prompt , by using the Win+Shift+ # combination to specify the position of the command prompt on the taskbar. We can then broadcast our command and hope that the user is away and doesn't corrupt it by interacting with the UI. Broadcast issue affects versions Windows Vista , 7 , 8 , Server 2008 , Server 2008 R2 , Server 2012 , RT. But Spawning a command prompt with the shortcut key does not work in Vista so you will have to check if the user is already running a command prompt and set SPAWN_PROMPT false. The WEB technique will execute a powershell encoded payload from a Web location. The FILE technique will drop an executable to the file system , set it to medium integrity and execute it. The TYPE technique will attempt to execute a powershell encoded payload directly from the command line but it may take some time to complete.  ， cve : advisories | CVE-2013-0008 , OSVDB-88966  ，  ， desc :  #   ，  #  # This file is part of the Metasploit Framework and may be subject to  ，  # redistribution and commercial restrictions.
