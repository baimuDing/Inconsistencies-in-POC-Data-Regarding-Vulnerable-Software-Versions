    "text": "title : Apport / ABRT chroot Privilege Escalation  ， detail : This Metasploit module attempts to gain root privileges on Linux systems by invoking the default coredump handler inside a namespace ( \"container\" ) . Apport versions 2.13 through 2.17.x before 2.17.1 on Ubuntu are vulnerable , due to a feature which allows forwarding reports to a container's Apport by changing the root directory before loading the crash report , causing 'usr/share/apport/apport' within the crashed task's directory to be executed. Similarly , Fedora is vulnerable when the kernel crash handler is configured to change root directory before executing ABRT , causing 'usr/libexec/abrt-hook-ccpp' within the crashed task's directory to be executed. In both instances , the crash handler does not drop privileges , resulting in code execution as root. This Metasploit module has been tested successfully on Apport 2.14.1 on Ubuntu 14.04.1 LTS x86 and x86_64 and ABRT on Fedora 19 and 20 x86_64.  ， cve : advisories | CVE-2015-1318  ，  ， desc :  #   ，  # This module requires Metasploit : https : /metasploit.com/download  ，  # Current source : https : /github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework",
