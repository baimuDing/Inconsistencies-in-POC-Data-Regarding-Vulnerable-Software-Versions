This module has been tested successfully on xscreensaver version 5.15 on Solaris 11.1 ( x86 ) and xscreensaver version 5.15 on Solaris 11.3 ( x86 ) .  ， cve : advisories | CVE-2019-3010  ，  ， desc :  #   ，  # This module requires Metasploit : https : /metasploit.com/download  ，  # Current source : https : /github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework",
