    "text": "title : MagnusBilling Remote Command Execution  ， detail : This Metasploit module exploits a command injection vulnerability in MagnusBilling application versions 6.x and 7.x that allows remote attackers to run arbitrary commands via an unauthenticated HTTP request. A piece of demonstration code is present in lib/icepay/icepay.php , with a call to an exec (  ) . The parameter to exec (  ) includes the GET parameter democ , which is controlled by the user and not properly sanitised/escaped. After successful exploitation , an unauthenticated user is able to execute arbitrary OS commands. The commands run with the privileges of the web server process , typically www-data or asterisk. At a minimum , this allows an attacker to compromise the billing system and its database.  ， cve : advisories | CVE-2023-30258  ，  ， desc :  #   ，  # This module requires Metasploit : https : /metasploit.com/download  ，  # Current source : https : /github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework  ，  ， require 'rex/stopwatch'  ，  ， 'Description' => %q{  ， A Command Injection vulnerability in MagnusBilling application 6.x and 7.x allows  ， remote attackers to run arbitrary commands via unauthenticated HTTP request.  ， A piece of demonstration code is present in `lib/icepay/icepay.php` , with a call to an exec (  ) .  ， The parameter to exec (  ) includes the GET parameter `democ` , which is controlled by the user and  ， not properly sanitised/escaped.  ， After successful exploitation , an unauthenticated user is able to execute arbitrary OS commands.  ， The commands run with the privileges of the web server process , typically `www-data` or `asterisk`.  ， At a minimum , this allows an attacker to compromise the billing system and its database.  ， The following MagnusBilling applications are vulnerable :   ， - MagnusBilling application version 6 ( all versions )  ;   ， - MagnusBilling application up to version 7.x without commit 7af21ed620 which fixes this vulnerability ;   ， }",
