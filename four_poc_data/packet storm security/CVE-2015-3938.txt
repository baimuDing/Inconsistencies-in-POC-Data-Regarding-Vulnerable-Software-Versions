Many functions of the ICS may be controlled via the built-in  ， HTTP-Server. By using specially crafted HTTP-messages all Ethernet based  ， communication may be permanently disrupted. This permanent denial of Service  ， can only be corrected via a cold restart of the ICS.  ， Detailed product description  ， We confirmed the bug on the following system :   ， FX3G-24M  ， CPU-Version : 2.10  ， FX3U-ENET-ADP Version : 1.20  ， Further products or firmware versions have not been tested  ， Description  ， The built-in HTTP application is unable to handle parameters with a length of  ， 100 bytes or more. This is true for all tested URLs but /fx_devmon.html. Even  ， parameters not used by the web applications trigger the DoS bug. This security  ， weakness can be exploited using both POST and GET HTTP requests.  ， As soon as any parameter with a length of at least 100 characters is  ， transmitted all Ethernet/IP/TCP communication is permanently halted. A  ， connected HMI looses its connection , the HTTP server is not available any more  ， and the System does not respond to ICMP ping requests or ARP requests.  ， The ICS has to undergo a cold restart be interrupting the power supply.  ， The PLC still continues to execute the internal logic program. Only the  ， Ethernet based communication is disrupted.  ， Proof of Concept  ， The following command ( all on one line ) crafts an GET request and sends it to  ， the PLC running on the IP address 192.168.155.80 : ",
