    "text": "title : Apache Struts 2 DefaultActionMapper Prefixes OGNL Code Execution  ， detail : The Struts 2 DefaultActionMapper supports a method for short-circuit navigation state changes by prefixing parameters with \"action : \" or \"redirect : \" , followed by a desired navigational target expression. This mechanism was intended to help with attaching navigational information to buttons within forms. In Struts 2 before 2.3.15.1 the information following \"action : \" , \"redirect : \" or \"redirectAction : \" is not properly sanitized. Since said information will be evaluated as OGNL expression against the value stack , this introduces the possibility to inject server side code. This Metasploit module has been tested successfully on Struts 2.3.15 over Tomcat 7 , with Windows 2003 SP2 and Ubuntu 10.04 operating systems.  ， cve : advisories | CVE-2013-2251 , OSVDB-95405  ，  ， desc :  #   ，  # This file is part of the Metasploit Framework and may be subject to  ，  # redistribution and commercial restrictions.
