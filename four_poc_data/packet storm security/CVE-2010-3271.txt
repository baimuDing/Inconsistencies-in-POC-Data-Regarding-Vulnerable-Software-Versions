Versions 7.0.0.11 and 7.0.0.13 are confirmed vulnerable.  ， cve : advisories | CVE-2010-3271  ，  ， desc : -BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-  ， Hash : SHA1  ， Core Security Technologies - CoreLabs Advisory  ， http : /corelabs.coresecurity.com/  ， IBM WebSphere Application Server Cross-Site Request Forgery  ， 1. * Advisory Information *   ， Title : IBM WebSphere Application Server Cross-Site Request Forgery  ， Advisory ID : CORE-2010-1021  ， Advisory URL : http : /www.coresecurity.com/content/IBM-WebSphere-CSRF  ， Date published : 2011-06-15  ， Date of last update : 2011-06-15  ， Vendors contacted : IBM  ， Release mode : User release  ， 2. * Vulnerability Information *   ， Class : Cross-Site Request Forgery ( CSRF )  [ CWE-352 ]   ， Impact : Code execution  ， Remotely Exploitable : Yes  ， Locally Exploitable : No  ， CVE Name : CVE-2010-3271  ， 3. * Vulnerability Description *   ， WebSphere is IBM's integration software platform. It includes the entire  ， middleware infrastructure -such as servers , services , and tools-  ， needed to write , run , and monitor 24x7 industrial-strength , on demand  ， Web applications and cross-platform , cross-product solutions. WebSphere  ， Application Server is the base for the infrastructure ; everything else  ， runs on top of it [ 1 ] .  ， The administrative console of IBM WebSphere Application Server is  ， vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery ( CSRF ) attacks , which can be  ， exploited by remote attackers to force a logged-in administrator to  ， perform unwanted actions on the IBM WebSphere administrative console , by  ， enticing him to visit a malicious web page.  ， 4. * Vulnerable packages *   ， . IBM WebSphere Application Server 7.0.0.11  ， . IBM WebSphere Application Server 7.0.0.13  ， . Older versions are probably affected too , but they were not checked.  ， 5. * Non-vulnerable packages *   ， Contact the vendor for a fix.  ， 6. * Vendor Information , Solutions and Workarounds *   ， Contact the vendor for a fix. The following are workarounds for this issue.  ， 6.1. * Server side *   ， According to OWASP [ 2 ]  , CSRF vulnerabilities can be avoided by checking  ， the referrer of the HTTP request and verifying that the request comes  ， from the original site. A potential workaround is thus to set a rule on  ， a Web Application Firewall that checks the referrer of the requests , and  ， verifies that all the requests to the WebSphere administrative console  ， are originated from the same site.  ， 6.2. * Client side *   ， An administrator of WebSphere administrative console could mitigate the  ， bug by using Firefox and the NoScript add-on ; more precisely by making  ， use of the ABE [ 3 ]  ( Application Boundaries Enforcer ) feature of  ， NoScript. With ABE it is possible to define rules such as the following :   ，  ， Site * .example.com  ， Accept from SELF  ， Deny  ，  ， This rule applies to * .example.com ; it will allow all the requests made  ， from the same site , and block all the requests directed to * .example.com  ， but generated from any other site , avoiding that Firefox sends the  ， request to the server. The syntax of the ABE rules is defined here :   ， http : /noscript.net/abe/abe_rules.pdf",
