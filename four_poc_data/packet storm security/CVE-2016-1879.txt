    "text": "title : FreeBSD SCTP ICMPv6 Denial Of Service  ， detail : FreeBSD suffers from an SCTP ICMPv6 error processing denial of service vulnerability.  ， cve : advisories | CVE-2016-1879  ，  ， desc :  #  ! /usr/bin/env python  ，  # - * - coding : utf-8 - * -  ，   ， '  ， Source : http : /blog.ptsecurity.com/2016/01/severe-vulnerabilities-detected-in.html  ，   ， SCTP ( stream control transmission protocol ) is a transport-layer protocol designed to transfer signaling messages in an IP environment. As a rule , mobile operators use this protocol in technological networks.  ，   ， This vulnerability threatens FreeBSD systems ( versions 9.3 , 10.1 , and 10.2 ) if they support SCTP and IPv6 ( default configuration ) . To exploit this flaw , a malefactor needs to send a specially crafted ICMPv6 message. And if he succeeds , he can conduct a DoS attack.  ，   ， Denial of service is caused by improper check of the length of an SCTP packet header received from the ICMPv6 error message. If the target recipient is unavailable , the router can generate an error message and send it to the sender via ICMPv6.  ，   ， This ICMPv6 packet includes the original IPv6 packet where the Next Header field indicates how SCTP is encapsulated.  ，   ， When the kernel receives the error message via ICMPv6 , it transfers the upper-level protocol packet to a necessary parser ( sctp6_ctlinput (  ) . The SCTP parser considers the incoming header has the required length , tries to copy it using m_copydata (  )  , which has offset values and the number of bytes. Since a twelve-byte chunk is expected , if the attacker sends a packet with an eleven-byte header , a NULL pointer is dereferenced causing kernel panic.  ，   ， There is no need for an open SCTP socket to successfully exploit this vulnerability. Scapy can help to create an ICMPv6 packet.  ， '",
