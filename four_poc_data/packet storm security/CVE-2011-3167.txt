    "text": "title : HP OpenView Network Node Manager ov.dll _OVBuildPath Buffer Overflow  ， detail : This Metasploit module exploits a stack buffer overflow in HP OpenView Network Node Manager 7.53 prior to NNM_01213 without the SSRT100649 hotfix. By specifying a long 'textFile' argument when calling the 'webappmon.exe' CGI program , an attacker can cause a stack-based buffer overflow and execute arbitrary code. The vulnerable code is within the \"_OVBuildPath\" function within \"ov.dll\". There are no stack cookies , so exploitation is achieved by overwriting the saved return address. The vulnerability is due to the use of the function \"_OVConcatPath\" which finally uses \"strcat\" in a insecure way. User controlled data is concatenated to a string which contains the OpenView installation path. To achieve reliable exploitation a directory traversal in OpenView5.exe ( OSVDB 44359 ) is being used to retrieve OpenView logs and disclose the installation path.  ， cve : advisories | CVE-2011-3167 , OSVDB-76775  ，  ， desc :  #   ，  # This file is part of the Metasploit Framework and may be subject to  ，  # redistribution and commercial restrictions.
