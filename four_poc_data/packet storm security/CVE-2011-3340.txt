    "text": "title : Netvolution CMS 2.5.8 Blind SQL Injection  ， detail : Netvolution CMS version 2.5.8 suffers from a remote blind SQL injection vulnerability via the HTTP referer header.  ， cve : advisories | CVE-2011-3340  ，  ， desc : Netvolution CMS v2.5.8 is vulnerable to a blind SQL injection attack  ， in the HTTP referer header. A malicious user may utilize this  ， vulnerability to modify content on the vulnerable website , inject  ， malicious javascript code to a visitors browser , collect CMS usernames  ， and plaintext passwords and , in some cases , execute commands on the  ， system hosting the database server. This is a critical vulnerability  ， since it does not require authentication and its exploitation may go  ， undetected.  ， Netvolution [ 1 ] is a commercial content management system by  ， ATCOM S.A. [ 2 ] with a large number of installations , most of them  ， belonging to Greek companies and organizations.  ， It appears that the Netvolution platform has both ASP and PHP  ， implementations. This advisory concerns a bug found in the ASP  ， implementation ( version 2.5.8 ) . We were unable to verify with the  ， vendor if this bug also affects other versions of the ASP ( or PHP )   ， codebase.  ， The bug is located in the code that parses the HTTP Referer header  ， value. An attacker may inject arbitrary SQL commands to the Netvolution  ， database by using a Referer header like the following :   ， Referer : 1' , '0' )  ; SQL  ， In the above example SQL is a placeholder ; the attacker would replace  ， this with the SQL commands to be executed by the database server.  ， The CMS does not provide feedback on the output of the SQL commands  ， but collection of this output is still possible through blind SQL  ， Injection techniques.  ， More information about this vulnerability and a Proof of Concept  ， are available here [ 3 ] .  ， As header field values are normally not included in HTTP transaction  ， logs , an attack based on this vulnerability may go unnoticed by web  ， server administrators.  ， We have repeatedly contacted the software vendor about this issue but  ， we have not received a reply.  ， Administrators of Netvolution websites are advised to check with the  ， software vendor to ensure that they are running a non-vulnerable  ， version of the CMS.  ， The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures ( CVE ) project has assigned  ， the candidate name CVE-2011-3340 to this issue.",
