    "text": "title : Dotclear 2.6.2 Arbitrary File Upload  ， detail : Dotclear versions 2.6.2 and below suffer from a remote shell upload vulnerability.  ， cve : advisories | CVE-2014-3782  ，  ， desc : -  ， Dotclear <= 2.6.2 ( Media Manager ) Unrestricted File Upload Vulnerability  ，  ，  [ - ] Software Link :   ， http : /dotclear.org/  ，  [ - ] Affected Versions :   ， Version 2.6.2 and probably prior versions.  ，  [ - ] Vulnerability Description :   ， The vulnerability exists because of the filemanager : isFileExclude (  ) method not properly verifying the extension of  ， uploaded files. This method just checks whether the uploaded file name matches the exclude_pattern regular expression ,   ， which by default is set to /\\.php $ /i. This could be exploited to execute arbitrary PHP code by uploading a file with  ， multiple extensions or other extensions ( like .php5 or .phtml ) which might be handled as PHP scripts. Successful  ， exploitation of this vulnerability requires an account with permissions to manage media items.  ，  [ - ] Solution :   ， Apply the vendor workaround or define a more secure media_exclusion setting ( PCRE value ) .",
