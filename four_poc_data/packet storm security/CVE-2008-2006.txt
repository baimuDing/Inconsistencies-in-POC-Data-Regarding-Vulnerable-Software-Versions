The calendar application can be used as a  ， stand-alone application or as a client-side component to calendar server  ， that lets users create and share multiple calendars and subscribe to  ， other user's calendars. Apple's iCal uses the iCalendar standard for its  ， calendar file format ( which uses the '.ics' filename extension )  [ 1 ] and  ， the CalDAV protocol for calendar sharing [ 2 ] . There is a growing number  ， of web sites providing calendars files and open subscription to calendar  ， updates [ 3 ]  [ 4 ]  [ 5 ] .  ， Three vulnerabilities discovered in the iCal application may allow  ， un-authenticated attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable  ， systems with ( and potentially without ) the assistance from the end user  ， of the application or to repeatean resource liberationdly execute a  ， denial of service attack to crash the iCal application.  ， The most serious of the three vulnerabilities is due to potential  ， memory corruption resulting from a resource liberation bug that can be  ， triggered with a malformed '.ics' calendar file specially crafted by a  ， would-be attacker.  ， The other two vulnerabilities lead to abnormal termination ( crash ) of  ， the iCal application due to null-pointer dereference bugs triggered  ，  ， execute arbitrary code on vulnerable systems using these two  ， vulnerabilities was researched but not proven possible.  ， Exploitation of these vulnerabilities in a client-side attack scenario  ， is possible with user assistance by opening or clicking on specially  ， crafted '.ics' file send over email or hosted on a malicious web server ;   ， or without direct user assistance if a would-be attacker has the ability  ， to legitimately add or modify calendar files on a CalDAV server.  ，  * Vulnerable Packages *   ， . iCal version 3.0.1 on MacOS X 10.5.1 ( Leopard ) .  ，  * Non-vulnerable Packages *   ， . Available through Apple security updates ( see vendor information below ) .  ，  * Vendor Information , Solutions and Workarounds *   ， The following information was provided by the vendor :   ， Availability  ， Apple security updates are available via the Software Update mechanism :   ， http : /support.apple.com/kb/HT1338  ， Apple security updates are also available for manual download via :   ， http : /www.apple.com/support/downloads/  ， Cross-References  ， If you provide cross-referencing information in your advisory please  ， link to the following URL : http : /support.apple.com/kb/HT1222",
