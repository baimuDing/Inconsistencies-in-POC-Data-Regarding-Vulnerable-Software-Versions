    "text": "title : HPE Systems Insight Manager AMF Deserialization Remote Code Execution  ， detail : A remotely exploitable vulnerability exists within HPE System Insight Manager ( SIM ) version 7.6.x that can be leveraged by a remote unauthenticated attacker to execute code within the context of HPE System Insight Manager's hpsimsvc.exe process , which runs with administrative privileges. The vulnerability occurs due to a failure to validate data during the deserialization process when a user submits a POST request to the /simsearch/messagebroker/amfsecure page. This module exploits this vulnerability by leveraging an outdated copy of Commons Collection , namely 3.2.2 , that ships with HPE SIM , to gain remote code execution as the administrative user running HPE SIM.  ， cve : advisories | CVE-2020-7200  ，  ， desc :  # This module requires Metasploit : https : /metasploit.com/download  ，  # Current source : https : /github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework  ，  ， 'Description' => %q{  ， A remotely exploitable vulnerability exists within HPE System Insight Manager ( SIM ) version 7.6.x that can be  ， leveraged by a remote unauthenticated attacker to execute code within the context of HPE System Insight  ， Manager's hpsimsvc.exe process , which runs with administrative privileges.
