All versions of SiteVision 4 until 4.5.6 and all versions of SiteVision 5 until 5.1.1 are vulnerable.  ， cve : advisories | CVE-2019-12733  ，  ， desc :  # SiteVision Remote Code Execution  ， CVE-2019-12733  ， https : /cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-12733  ， https : /www.cybercom.com/About-Cybercom/Blogs/Security-Advisories/high-risk-vulnerabilities-in-cms-product/  ，  # Summary  ， Attackers may execute arbitrary code as root on the target server after gaining access to a low-privilege account.  ，  # Vendor Description  ， SiteVision AB is a Swedish product company focused on developing the portal and web publishing platform SiteVision.  ，  # Affected Versions  ， All versions of SiteVision 4 until 4.5.6.  ， All versions of SiteVision 5 until 5.1.1.  ， Earlier major versions are assumed to be vulnerable.  ，  # Technical Details  ， The SiteVision application does not sufficiently validate whether or not the current user is permitted to add or edit modules of the \"script\" type. This means that a low-privilege user such as an Editor ( \"Redaktr\" ) can inject a new script module , or edit an existing one , and leverage it to execute arbitrary code.  ， The access control flaw allowing users to inject non-authorized modules are described separately in CVE-2019-12734.",
