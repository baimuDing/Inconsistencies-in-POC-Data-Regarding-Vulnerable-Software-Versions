All versions of Verax NMS prior to 2.1.0 are vulnerable.  ， cve : advisories | CVE-2013-1350  ，  ， desc : Verax NMS Authenication Bypass ( CVE-2013-1350 )   ， I. BACKGROUND  ，  ， Verax NMS provides a service-oriented , unified  ， management & monitoring of networks , applications  ， and infrastructure enabling quick problem detection ,   ， root-cause analysis , reporting and automating recovery ,   ， reducing costs and shortening downtimes of IT service delivery.  ， Source : http : /www.veraxsystems.com/en/products/nms  ， II. DESCRIPTION  ，  ， Verax NMS suffers from multiple authentication and  ， authorization flaws which allow a remote attacker to  ， add and delete users , change the passwords of other users ,   ， and access other critical application data. These issues  ， stem from unauthenticated methods , such as userGroupService.getAllGroups (  )  ,   ， which fail to validate that the user either 1 ) has ownership or  ， access rights to the requested objects/resources and 2 ) fails to  ， confirm whether or not the caller has properly authenticated to the  ， application and still maintains a valid session.  ， The below Python code can be used to test vulnerable installations. If  ， successful , the response will contain an array of user objects which  ， includes all user details , such as username , password , e-mail address , etc.  ，  ，  #  ! /usr/bin/python  ，  # just based on http : /www.pyamf.org/tutorials/general/client.html # basic-example",
