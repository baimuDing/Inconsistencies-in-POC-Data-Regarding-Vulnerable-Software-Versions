VLC versions 0.8.6d and below and Miro Player versions 1.1 and below are vulnerable. Proof of concept code included.  ， cve : advisories | CVE-2008-0984  ，  ， desc : -BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-  ， Hash : SHA1  ， Core Security Technologies - CoreLabs Advisory  ， http : /www.coresecurity.com/corelabs  ， VLC media player chunk context validation error  ，  * Advisory Information *   ， Title : VLC media player chunk context validation error  ， Advisory ID : CORE-2008-0130  ， Advisory URL : http : /www.coresecurity.com/?action=item&id=2147  ， Date published : 2008-02-27  ， Date of last update : 2008-02-27  ， Vendors contacted : VLC , Miro player  ， Release mode : Coordinated release  ，  * Vulnerability Information *   ， Class : Arbitrary memory corruption  ， Remotely Exploitable : Yes ( client-side )   ， Locally Exploitable : No  ， Bugtraq ID : 28007  ， CVE Name : CVE-2008-0984  ，  * Vulnerability Description *   ， VLC player [ 1 ] is an open-source popular multimedia player for various  ， audio and video formats , and various streaming protocols. It can also be  ， used as a server to stream in unicast or multicast in IPv4 or IPv6 on a  ， high-bandwidth network.  ， The VideoLAN ( VLC ) media player package is vulnerable to an arbitrary  ， memory corruption vulnerability , which can be exploited by malicious  ， remote attackers to compromise a user's system. The vulnerability is  ， caused due to the VLC ( 'demux/mp4/mp4.c' ) library not properly  ， sanitizing certain tags on a MOV file before using them to index an  ， array on the heap. This can be exploited to get arbitrary code execution  ， by opening a specially crafted file.  ，  * Vulnerable Packages *   ， . VLC 0.8.6d and earlier.  ， . Miro Player 1.1 and earlier , uses VLC code.  ，  * Non-vulnerable Packages *   ， . VLC 0.8.6e  ，  * Vendor Information , Solutions and Workarounds *   ， The VideoLAN project has issued a security advisory describing this  ， vulnerability [ 2 ]  , partially quoted below.  ， VLC media player's MPEG-4 file format parser ( a.k.a. the MP4 demuxer )   ， suffers from an arbitrary memory overwrite vulnerability when using  ， specially crafted ( invalid ) MP4 input files. If successful , a malicious  ， third party could trigger execution of arbitrary code within the context  ， of the VLC media player , or otherwise crash the player instance.  ， Exploitation of the MP4 demuxer problem requires the user to explicitly  ， open a specially crafted file. The user should refrain from opening  ， files from untrusted third parties or accessing untrusted Web sites ( or  ， disable the VLC browser plugins )  , until the patch is applied.  ， VLC media player 0.8.6e addresses these issues and introduces further  ， usability fixes. The source code patch can be downloaded separately here  ，  [ 3 ] . Pre-compiled packages will be available at the usual download  ， locations shortly.",
