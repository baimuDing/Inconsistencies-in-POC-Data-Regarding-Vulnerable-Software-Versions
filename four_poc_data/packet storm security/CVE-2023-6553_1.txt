    "text": "title : WordPress Backup Migration 1.3.7 Remote Command Execution  ， detail : This Metasploit module exploits an unauthenticated remote command execution vulnerability in WordPress Backup Migration plugin versions 1.3.7 and below. The vulnerability is exploitable through the Content-Dir header which is sent to the /wp-content/plugins/backup-backup/includes/backup-heart.php endpoint. The exploit makes use of a neat technique called PHP Filter Chaining which allows an attacker to prepend bytes to a string by continuously chaining character encoding conversions. This allows an attacker to prepend a PHP payload to a string which gets evaluated by a require statement , which results in command execution.  ， cve : advisories | CVE-2023-6553  ，  ， desc :  #   ，  # This module requires Metasploit : https : /metasploit.com/download  ，  # Current source : https : /github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework  ，   ， 'Description' => %q{  ， This module exploits an unauth RCE in the WordPress plugin : Backup Migration ( <= 1.3.7 ) .
