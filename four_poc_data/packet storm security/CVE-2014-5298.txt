    "text": "title : X2Engine 4.1.7 Unrestricted File Upload  ， detail : X2Engine versions 4.1.7 and below suffer from an unrestricted file upload vulnerability due to poor use of a blacklist.  ， cve : advisories | CVE-2014-5298  ，  ， desc : -  ， X2Engine <= 4.1.7 ( FileUploadsFilter.php ) Unrestricted File Upload Vulnerability  ，  ，  [ - ] Software Link :   ， http : /www.x2engine.com/  ，  [ - ] Affected Versions :   ， Version 4.1.7 and probably prior versions.  ，  [ - ] Vulnerability Description :   ， The vulnerability exists because of the FileUploadsFilter : EXT_BLACKLIST constant , which is a regular  ， expression for blacklisted files. Due to a lack of case-insensitive matching , the global upload filter  ， could be bypassed by uploading a malicious file with capital letters within the extension. This can be  ， exploited to upload and execute arbitrary PHP scripts if X2Engine is running on a case-insensitive  ， filesystem or if the web server is configured to handle files extensions in a case-insensitive fashion.  ，  [ - ] Solution :   ， Update to version 4.2 or later.",
