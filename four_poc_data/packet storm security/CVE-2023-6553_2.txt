This is due to an attacker being able to control the values passed to an include , and subsequently leverage that to achieve remote code execution. This makes it possible for unauthenticated threat actors to easily execute code on the server.  ， Technical Analysis  ， Line 118 within the /includes/backup-heart.php file used by the Backup Migration plugin attempts to include bypasser.php from the BMI_INCLUDES directory. The BMI_INCLUDES directory is defined by concatenating BMI_ROOT_DIR with the includes string on line 64. However , note that BMI_ROOT_DIR is defined via the content-dir HTTP header on line 62.  ， affected_code_image_2  ， This means that the BMI_ROOT_DIR is user-controllable. By submitting a specially-crafted request , threat-actors can leverage this issue to include arbitrary , malicious PHP code and execute arbitrary commands on the underlying server in the security context of the WordPress instance.",
