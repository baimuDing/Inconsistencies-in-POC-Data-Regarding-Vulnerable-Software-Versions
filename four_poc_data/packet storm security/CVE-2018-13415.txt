    "text": "title : Plex Media Server 1.13.2.5154 SSDP Processing XML Injection  ， detail : Plex Media Server version 1.13.2.5154 suffers from an XML external entity injection vulnerability in SSDP processing.  ， cve : advisories | CVE-2018-13415  ，  ， desc : Issue : Out-of-Band XE in Plex Media Server's SSDP Processing  ， Reserved CVE : CVE-2018-13415  ，   ，  # Vulnerability Overview  ， The XML parsing engine for Plex Media Server's SSDP/UPNP functionality is vulnerable to an XML External Entity Processing ( XE ) attack. Unauthenticated attackers on the same LAN can use this vulnerability to :   ，   ， - Access arbitrary files from the filesystem with the same permission as the user account running Plex.  ， - Initiate SMB connections to capture NetNTLM challenge/response and crack to clear-text password.  ， - Initiate SMB connections to relay NetNTLM challenge/response and achieve Remote Command Execution in Windows domains.  ，   ， Exploitation can be demonstrated using evil-ssdp ( https : /gitlab.com/initstring/evil-ssdp ) .  ，   ，  # Discovered By  ， Chris Moberly @ The Missing Link Security  ，   ，  # Vendor Status  ， Disclosed to Plex security team , pending resolution.  ，   ，  # Vulnerability Details  ， Attack type : Remote , unauthenticated  ， Impact : Information disclosure up to code execution  ， Affected component : Plex Media Server's SSDP discovery / parsing with libxml2  ， Operating Systems affected : Verified Windows 10 and Ubuntu Linux 18.10 ( likely all versions )   ， Plex version affected : Tested on 1.13.2.5154 ( current as of July 2018 ) . Older versions likely also vulnerable.  ， Attack vector : XE  ，   ，  # Technical Overview  ， Plex , like many other media servers , will attempt to discover other devices on a local network. The discovery process is handled by Simple Service Discovery Protocol ( SSDP )  , which sends a UDP multicast out to 239.255.255.250 on port 1900. This is the first step in finding and adding Universal Plug and Play ( UPNP ) devices.  ，   ， We can reply to that UDP multicast directly on the same port that the request initiated from , informing this client that we have a shared device. When we do this , we provide the location of an XML file containing more information about our device. This is called a Device Descriptor.  ，   ， Plex will automatically access the Device Descriptor over HTTP , parsing the XML content. This is expected behaviour for SSDP/UPNP.  ，   ， By hosting a specially crafted XML file at that location , we can force Plex Media Server to do several things. The POC used to prove this vulnerability ( POC 1 below ) contained the following XML content :   ，   ， `",
