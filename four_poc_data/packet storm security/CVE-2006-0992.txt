    "text": "title : Novell Messenger Server 2.0 Accept-Language Overflow  ， detail : This Metasploit module exploits a stack overflow in Novell GroupWise Messenger Server v2.0. This flaw is triggered by any HTTP request with an Accept-Language header greater than 16 bytes. To overwrite the return address on the stack , we must first pass a memcpy (  ) operation that uses pointers we supply. Due to the large list of restricted characters and the limitations of the current encoder modules , very few payloads are usable.  ， cve : advisories | CVE-2006-0992  ，  ， desc :  #   ，  #  $ Id $   ，   ，  # This file is part of the Metasploit Framework and may be subject to  ，  # redistribution and commercial restrictions.
