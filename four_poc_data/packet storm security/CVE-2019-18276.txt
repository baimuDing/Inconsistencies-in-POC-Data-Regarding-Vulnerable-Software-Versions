    "text": "title : Bash 5.0 Patch 11 Privilege Escalation  ， detail : An issue was discovered in disable_priv_mode in shell.c in GNU Bash through 5.0 patch 11. By default , if Bash is run with its effective UID not equal to its real UID , it will drop privileges by setting its effective UID to its real UID. However , it does so incorrectly. On Linux and other systems that support \"saved UID\" functionality , the saved UID is not dropped. An attacker with command execution in the shell can use \"enable -f\" for runtime loading of a new builtin , which can be a shared object that calls setuid (  ) and therefore regains privileges. However , binaries running with an effective UID of 0 are unaffected.  ， cve : advisories | CVE-2019-18276  ，  ， desc :  # Exploit Title : Bash 5.0 Patch 11 - SUID Priv Drop Exploit  ，  # Date : 2019-11-29  ，  # Original Author : Ian Pudney , Chet Ramey  ，  # Exploit Author : Mohin Paramasivam ( Shad0wQu35t )   ，  # Version : < Bash 5.0 Patch 11  ，  # Tested on Linux",
