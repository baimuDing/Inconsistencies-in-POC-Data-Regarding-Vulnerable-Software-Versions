The ability to create hard links to directories is  ， wrong implemented and such an issue is affecting os versions greater or  ， equal to 10.5. Officially Apple allows you to create hard links only for  ， your time machine. <see wiki> Vulnerability CVE-2013-6799 ( incomplete fix  ，  ， hard links may be freely high. To create N hard links , you must use a  ， special algorithm which creates links from the top of the file system tree.  ， This means that first we create the directory structure and once created we  ， need to go from up to down by creating hard links. The last time I've  ， mentioned of the possibility of a kernel crash by performing the 'ls'  ， command. This situation occurs in conjunction with the 'find' application.  ， Commands such as 'ls' behave in unexpected ways. Apple are going find this  ， crash point in code. To create huge hard links structure , use this code  ， http : /cert.cx/stuff/l2.c  ，  ， h1XSS : tysiak cx $ uname -a  ， Darwin 000000000000000.home 13.1.0 Darwin Kernel Version 13.1.0 : Thu Jan 16  ， 19 : 40 : 37 PST 2014 ; root : xnu-2422.90.20 ~ 2/RELEASE_X86_64 x86_64  ， h1xss : tysiak cx $ gcc -o l2 l2.c  ， h1xss : tysiak cx $ ./l2 1000  ， .  ， h1xss : tysiak cx $ cat loop.sh",
