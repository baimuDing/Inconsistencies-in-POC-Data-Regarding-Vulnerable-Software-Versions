    "text": "title : Unreal Tournament 2004 Overflow  ， detail : This is an exploit for the GameSpy secure query in the Unreal Engine. This exploit only requires one UDP packet , which can be both spoofed and sent to a broadcast address. Usually , the GameSpy query server listens on port 7787 , but you can manually specify the port as well. The RunServer.sh script will automatically restart the server upon a crash , giving us the ability to bruteforce the service and exploit it multiple times.  ， cve : advisories | CVE-2004-0608  ，  ， desc :  #   ，  #  $ Id $   ，   ，  # This file is part of the Metasploit Framework and may be subject to  ，  # redistribution and commercial restrictions.
