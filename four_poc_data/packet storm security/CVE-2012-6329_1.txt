    "text": "title : TWiki MAKETEXT Remote Command Execution  ， detail : This Metasploit module exploits a vulnerability in the MAKETEXT Twiki variable. By using a specially crafted MAKETEXT , a malicious user can execute shell commands since user input is passed to the Perl \"eval\" command without first being sanitized. The problem is caused by an underlying security issue in the CPAN : Locale : Maketext module. This works in TWiki sites that have user interface localization enabled ( UserInterfaceInternationalisation variable set ) . If USERNAME and PASSWORD aren't provided , anonymous access will be tried. Also , if the 'TwikiPage' option isn't provided , the module will try to create a random page on the SandBox space. The modules has been tested successfully on TWiki 5.1.2 as distributed with the official TWiki-VM-5.1.2-1 virtual machine.  ， cve : advisories | CVE-2012-6329 , OSVDB-88460  ，  ， desc :  #   ，  # This file is part of the Metasploit Framework and may be subject to  ，  # redistribution and commercial restrictions.
