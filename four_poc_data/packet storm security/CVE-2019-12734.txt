    "text": "title : SiteVision 4.x / 5.x Insufficient Module Access Control  ， detail : SiteVision suffers from an issue where attacker may inject non-authorized module when editing pages using a lower privileged account , which can lead to cross site scripting and remote code execution. All versions of SiteVision 4 until 4.5.6 and all versions of SiteVision 5 until 5.1.1 are vulnerable.  ， cve : advisories | CVE-2019-12734  ，  ， desc :  # SiteVision Insufficient Module Access Control  ， CVE-2019-12734  ， https : /cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-12734  ， https : /www.cybercom.com/About-Cybercom/Blogs/Security-Advisories/high-risk-vulnerabilities-in-cms-product/  ，  # Summary  ， Attackers may inject non-authorised modules when editing pages using a low-privilege account , leading to impacts ranging from Cross-Site Scripting to Remote Code Execution.  ，  # Vendor Description  ， SiteVision AB is a Swedish product company focused on developing the portal and web publishing platform SiteVision.  ，  # Affected Versions  ， All versions of SiteVision 4 until 4.5.6.  ， All versions of SiteVision 5 until 5.1.1.  ， Earlier major versions are assumed to be vulnerable.  ，  # Technical Details  ， This vulnerability allows remote code execution as described in CVE-2019-12733.  ， Modules are basic building blocks in SiteVision pages and templates ; they can feature display content such as headings and paragraphs , social functions and commenting , raw HTML , or server-side scripts.  ， The SiteVision application does not sufficiently assert whether or not the current user is authorised to add a specific module type to the current page , allowing attackers with low-privilege to add hostile content. This can trivially be reproduced by adding a paragraph text module , and changing \"text\" to \"html\" ( or any other type ) in the outgoing HTTP request. The application does not check whether or not the user is authorised to add the requested module ; it relies on the fact that the user interface does not expose a button for it.  ， Reproduced on SiteVision 4 and 5 ; the following steps applies to SiteVision 5 : ",
