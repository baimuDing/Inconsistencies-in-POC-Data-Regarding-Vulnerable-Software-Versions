    "text": "title : ABRT raceabrt Privilege Escalation  ， detail : This Metasploit module attempts to gain root privileges on Fedora systems with a vulnerable version of Automatic Bug Reporting Tool ( ABRT ) configured as the crash handler. A race condition allows local users to change ownership of arbitrary files ( CVE-2015-3315 ) . This Metasploit module uses a symlink attack on '/var/tmp/abrt/ * /maps' to change the ownership of /etc/passwd , then adds a new user with UID=0 GID=0 to gain root privileges. Winning the race could take a few minutes. This Metasploit module has been tested successfully on ABRT packaged version 2.1.5-1.fc19 on Fedora Desktop 19 x86_64 , 2.2.1-1.fc19 on Fedora Desktop 19 x86_64 and 2.2.2-2.fc20 on Fedora Desktop 20 x86_64. Fedora 21 and Red Hat 7 systems are reportedly affected , but untested.  ， cve : advisories | CVE-2015-3315  ，  ， desc :  #   ，  # This module requires Metasploit : https : /metasploit.com/download  ，  # Current source : https : /github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework",
