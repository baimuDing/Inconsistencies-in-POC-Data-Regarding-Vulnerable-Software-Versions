    "text": "title : Sera 1.2 Local Root / Password Disclosure  ， detail : Sera version 1.2 suffers from a password disclosure that can allow for root privilege escalation.  ， cve : advisories | CVE-2017-15918  ，  ， desc : Sera is a free app for mac and iOS that lets you unlock your mac automatically  ， when your iphone is within a configured proximity.  ， Unfortunately to facilitate this it stores the users login password in their  ， home directory at :   ，  ~ /Library/Preferences/no.ignitum.SeraOSX.plist  ， This makes root privilege escalation trivial and worse than that even  ， facilitates dumping the keychain as we can easily obtain the user's login  ， password. If they are an admin user we can even dump items from the system  ， keychain.  ， The author of Sera has said he will shut the project down and make the code  ， publicly available so no fix is likely to be forthcoming anytime soon.  ， It is strongly recommended not to use this app and if you have done so in the  ， past make sure you remove this file that contains your login password.  ， https : /m4.rkw.io/sera_1.2.sh.txt  ， dbf4f7b64cac8a60a2c7b3ba2a3988b84a148a3f6e31bcb58d4554e5e74d8edf",
