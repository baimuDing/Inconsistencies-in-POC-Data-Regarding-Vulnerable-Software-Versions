    "text": "title : FlexDotnetCMS 1.5.8 Arbitrary ASP File Upload  ， detail : This Metasploit module exploits an arbitrary file upload vulnerability in FlexDotnetCMS versions 1.5.8 and prior in order to execute arbitrary commands with elevated privileges.  ， cve : advisories | CVE-2020-27386  ，  ， desc :  #   ，  # This module requires Metasploit : https : /metasploit.com/download  ，  # Current source : https : /github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework  ，   ， 'Description' => %q{  ， This module exploits an arbitrary file upload vulnerability in  ， FlexDotnetCMS v1.5.8 and prior in order to execute arbitrary  ， commands with elevated privileges.  ， The module first tries to authenticate to FlexDotnetCMS via an HTTP  ， POST request to `/login`. It then attempts to upload a random TXT  ， file and subsequently uses the FlexDotnetCMS file editor to rename  ， the TXT file to an ASP file. If this succeeds , the target is  ， vulnerable and the ASP file is generated as a copy of the TXT file ,   ， which remains on the server.  ， Next , the module sends another request to rename the TXT file to an  ， ASP file , this time adding the payload. Finally , the module tries  ， to execute the ASP payload via a simple HTTP GET request to  ， `/media/uploads/asp_payload`  ， Valid credentials for a FlexDotnetCMS user with permissions to use  ， the FileManager are required. This module has been successfully  ， tested against FlexDotnetCMS v1.5.8 running on Windows Server 2012.  ， }",
