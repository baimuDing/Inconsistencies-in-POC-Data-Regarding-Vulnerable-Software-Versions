    "text": "title : SysAid Help Desk 'rdslogs' Arbitrary File Upload  ， detail : This Metasploit module exploits a file upload vulnerability in SysAid Help Desk v14.3 and v14.4. The vulnerability exists in the RdsLogsEntry servlet which accepts unauthenticated file uploads and handles zip file contents in a insecure way. By combining both weaknesses , a remote attacker can accomplish remote code execution. Note that this will only work if the target is running Java 6 or 7 up to 7u25 , as Java 7u40 and above introduces a protection against null byte injection in file names. This Metasploit module has been tested successfully on version v14.3.12 b22 and v14.4.32 b25 in Linux. In theory this module also works on Windows , but SysAid seems to bundle Java 7u40 and above with the Windows package which prevents the vulnerability from being exploited.  ， cve : advisories | CVE-2015-2995  ，  ， desc :  #   ，  # This module requires Metasploit : http : /metasploit.com/download  ，  # Current source : https : /github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework  ，  ， require 'msf/core'  ， require 'zlib'  ，  ， 'Description' => %q{  ， This module exploits a file upload vulnerability in SysAid Help Desk v14.3 and v14.4.  ， The vulnerability exists in the RdsLogsEntry servlet which accepts unauthenticated  ， file uploads and handles zip file contents in a insecure way.
