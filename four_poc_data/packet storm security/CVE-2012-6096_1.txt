It reminds me a  ，  # lot of some of my early experiments in C , back when I  ，  # still had no clue what I was doing. ( Ok , fair enough ,   ，  # I still don't , heheh. )   ，  ，  # Ok , I'll come clean. This exploit doesn't exactly  ，  # defeat FORTIFY. This approach is likely to work just FINE  ，  # on other crippled distro's though , think of stuff like  ，  # ArchLinux , Slackware , and all those Gentoo kids twiddling  ，  # their CFLAGS.
