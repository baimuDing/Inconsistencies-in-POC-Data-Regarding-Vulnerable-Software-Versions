    "text": "title : Microsoft Tagged Image File Format ( TIFF ) Integer Overflow  ， detail : This Metasploit module exploits a vulnerability found in Microsoft's Tagged Image File Format. It was originally discovered in the wild , targeting Windows XP and Windows Server 2003 users running Microsoft Office , specifically in the Middle East and South Asia region. The flaw is due to a DWORD value extracted from the TIFF file that is embedded as a drawing in Microsoft Office , and how it gets calculated with user-controlled inputs , and stored in the EAX register. The 32-bit register will run out of storage space to represent the large value , which ends up being 0 , but it still gets pushed as a dwBytes argument ( size ) for a HeapAlloc call. The HeapAlloc function will allocate a chunk anyway with size 0 , and the address of this chunk is used as the destination buffer of a memcpy function , where the source buffer is the EXIF data ( an extended image format supported by TIFF )  , and is also user-controlled. A function pointer in the chunk returned by HeapAlloc will end up being overwritten by the memcpy function , and then later used in OGL ! GdipCreatePath. By successfully controlling this function pointer , and the memory layout using ActiveX , it is possible to gain arbitrary code execution under the context of the user.  ， cve : advisories | CVE-2013-3906  ，  ， desc :  #   ，  # This module requires Metasploit : http/metasploit.com/download  ，  # Current source : https : /github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework  ，  ， require 'msf/core'  ， require 'rex/zip'  ， require 'nokogiri'  ， module : Nokogiri  ， module XML",
