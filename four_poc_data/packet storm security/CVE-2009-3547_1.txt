They haven't  ， innovated since they replaced exploitable string copies with  ， exploitable string truncations 6 or so years ago.  ，   ， The entire joke of a thread can be read here :   ， http : /www.pubbs.net/openbsd/200911/4582/  ， \"Our focus therefore is always on finding innovative ideas which make  ， bugs very hard to exploit succesfully.\"  ， \"He's too busy watching monkey porn instead of  ， building researching last-year's security technology that will stop  ， an exploit technique that has been exploited multiple times.\"  ， \"it seems that everyone else is slowly coming around to the  ， same solution.\"  ，   ， So let's talk about this \"innovation\" of theirs with their  ， implementation of mmap_min_addr :   ，   ， They implemented it in 2008 , a year after Linux implemented it , a  ， year after the public phrack article on the bug class , more than a  ， year after my mail to dailydave with the first public Linux kernel  ， exploit for the bug class , and over two years after UDEREF was  ， implemented in PaX ( providing complete protection against the smaller",
