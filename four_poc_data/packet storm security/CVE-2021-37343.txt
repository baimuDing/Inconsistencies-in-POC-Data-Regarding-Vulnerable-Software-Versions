    "text": "title : Nagios XI Autodiscovery Shell Upload  ， detail : This Metasploit module exploits a path traversal issue in Nagios XI before version 5.8.5. The path traversal allows a remote and authenticated administrator to upload a PHP web shell and execute code as www-data. The module achieves this by creating an autodiscovery job with an id field containing a path traversal to a writable and remotely accessible directory , and custom_ports field containing the web shell. A cron file will be created using the chosen path and file name , and the web shell is embedded in the file. After the web shell has been written to the victim , this module will then use the web shell to establish a Meterpreter session or a reverse shell. By default , the web shell is deleted by the module , and the autodiscovery job is removed as well.  ， cve : advisories | CVE-2021-37343  ，  ， desc :  #   ，  # This module requires Metasploit : https : /metasploit.com/download  ，  # Current source : https : /github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework  ，   ， 'Description' => %q{  ， This module exploits a path traversal issue in Nagios XI before version 5.8.5 ( CVE-2021-37343 ) .  ， The path traversal allows a remote and authenticated administrator to upload a PHP web shell  ， and execute code as `www-data`.
