Full details provided.  ， cve : advisories | CVE-2009-0244  ，  ， desc : Title : HTC / Android OBEX FTP Service Directory Traversal  ， Author : Alberto Moreno Tablado  ， Vendor : HTC  ， Products :   ， - HTC devices running Android 2.1  ， - HTC devices running Android 2.2  ， References : http : /www.seguridadmobile.com/android/android-security/HTC-Android-OBEX-FTP-Service-Directory-Traversal.html  ， Summary :   ， HTC devices running Android 2.1 and Android 2.2 are prone to a directory traversal vulnerability in the Bluetooth OBEX FTP Service. Exploiting this issue allows a remote authenticated attacker to list arbitrary directories , and read arbitrary files , via a ./ in a pathname.  ， Description :   ， In the present HTC / Android phones include a Bluetooth stack , which provides Bluetooth communications with other remote devices. The File Transfer Profile ( OBEX FTP ) is one among all the Bluetooth services that may be implemented in the stack.  ， The OBEX FTP service is a software implementation of the File Transfer Profile ( FTP ) . The File Transfer Profile ( FTP ) is intended for data exchange and it is based on the OBEX communications client-server protocol. The service is present in a large number of Bluetooth mobile phones. This service can be used for sending files from the phone to other remote devices and also allows remote devices to browse shared folders and download files from the phone.  ， In HTC / Android phones , the default directory of the OBEX FTP Server is the SDCard. Only files placed in the directory of the SDCard can be shared. The user cannot select other directory so sensitive files related to the operating system are not exposed.  ， There exists a Directory Traversal vulnerability in the OBEX FTP Service in the Bluetooth Stack implemented in HTC devices running Android 2.1 and Android 2.2. The OBEX FTP Server is a 3rd party driver developed by HTC and installed on HTC devices running Android operating system , so the vulnerability affects to this vendor specifically.  ， A remote attacker ( who previously owned authentication and authorization rights ) can use tools like ObexFTP or gnomevfs-ls over Linux to traverse to parent directories out of the default Bluetooth shared folder by using ./ or .\\ marks.  ， The only requirement is that the attacker must have authentication and authorization privileges over Bluetooth. Pairing up with the remote device should be enough to get it. However , more sophisticated attacks , such as sniffing the Bluetooth pairing , linkkey cracking and MAC address spoofing , can be used in order to avoid this. In case the attacker succeeded in getting the proper privileges , further actions will be transparent to the user.  ， Scope of the attack :   ， The Directory Traversal vulnerability allows a remote attacker to browse folders located anywhere in the file system and download any file contained in any folder.  ， 1 ) List arbitrary directories  ， Any directory within the file system of the phone can be browsed , beyond the limits of the default shared folder ( the SDCard ) .  ， The following example is the output of a command for listing a directory with ObexFTP. Given the Bluetooth MAC address of an HTC / Android based mobile phone and the path ./ , the command retrieves the content of the parent of the default directory of the FTP server , this is the root directory of the disk file system :   ， gospel @ ubuntu :  ~  $ obexftp -b 90 : 21 : 55 : 8C : 2C : 3A -l \"./\"  ， Browsing 90 : 21 : 55 : 8C : 2C : 3A .  ， Connecting.\\done  ， Tried to connect for 29ms  ， Receiving \"./\".
