    "text": "title : Persits XUpload ActiveX MakeHttpRequest Directory Traversal  ， detail : This Metasploit module exploits a directory traversal in Persits Software Inc's XUpload ActiveX control ( version 3.0.0.3 ) that's included in HP LoadRunner 9.5. By passing a string containing \".\\\" sequences to the MakeHttpRequest method , an attacker is able to write arbitrary files to arbitrary locations on disk. Code execution occurs by writing to the All Users Startup Programs directory. You may want to combine this module with the use of multi/handler since a user would have to log for the payload to execute.  ， cve : advisories | CVE-2009-3693  ，  ， desc :  #   ，  #  $ Id : persits_xupload_traversal.rb 7760 2009-12-08 21 : 24 : 45Z jduck $   ，   ，  # This file is part of the Metasploit Framework and may be subject to  ，  # redistribution and commercial restrictions.
