When SSL is re-established on a NDMP connection that previously has had SSL established, the BIO struct for the connection's previous SSL session is reused, even though it has previously been freed. This Metasploit module supports 3 specific versions of the Backup Exec agent in the 14, 15 and 16 series on 64-bit and 32-bit versions of Windows and has been tested from Vista to Windows 10.  ， cve:advisories | CVE-2017-8895  ， date_time:Jun 29, 2017  ， desc:#  ， # This module requires Metasploit: http:/metasploit.com/download  ， # Current source: https:/github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework  ，  ， require 'msf/core/exploit/ndmp_socket'  ， require 'openssl'  ， require 'xdr'"
