    "text": "title : FLIR AX8 1.46.16 Traversal / Access Control / Command Injection / XSS  ， detail : FLIR AX8 versions 1.46.16 and below suffer from command injection , directory traversal , improper access control , and cross site scripting vulnerabilities.  ， cve : advisories | CVE-2022-37060 , CVE-2022-37061 , CVE-2022-37062 , CVE-2022-37063  ，  ， desc :  # FLIR AX8 vulnerabilities.  ，  # Product description :   ， The FLIR AX8 is a thermal sensor with imaging capabilities , combining thermal and visual cameras that provides continuous temperature monitoring and alarming for critical electrical and mechanical equipment.  ，  # Affected products :   ， All FLIR AX8 thermal sensor cameras version up to and including `1.46.16`.  ，  # Summary of the 4 vulnerabilities found / What we were able to find :   ，  *  [ CVE-2022-37061 ] - Unauthenticated OS Command Injection.  ， FLIR AX8 is affected by an unauthenticated remote command injection vulnerability. This can be exploited to inject and execute arbitrary shell commands as the root user through the `id` HTTP POST parameter in `res.php` endpoint. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the underlying operating system with the root privileges. This issue affects all FLIR AX8 thermal sensor cameras version up to and including `1.46.16`.  ，  *  [ CVE-2022-37060 ] - Unauthenticated Directory Traversal.  ， FLIR AX8 is affected by a directory traversal vulnerability due to an improper access restriction. An unauthenticated , remote attacker can exploit this , by sending a URI that contains directory traversal characters , to disclose the contents of files located outside of the server's restricted path. This issue affects all FLIR AX8 thermal sensor cameras version up to and including `1.46.16`.  ，  *  [ CVE-2022-37062 ] - Improper Access Control.  ， FLIR AX8 is affected by an insecure design vulnerability due to an improper directory access restriction. An unauthenticated , remote attacker can exploit this , by sending a URI that contains the path of the SQLite users database , and download it. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to extract usernames and hashed passwords. This issue affects all FLIR AX8 thermal sensor cameras version up to and including `1.46.16`.  ，  *  [ CVE-2022-37063 ] - Reflected cross-site scripting.  ， FLIR AX8 is affected by a reflected cross-site scripting ( XSS ) vulnerability due to an improper input sanitization. An authenticated , remote attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the web management interface. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to insert malicious JavaScript code. This issue affects all FLIR AX8 thermal sensor cameras version up to and including `1.46.16`.  ，  # Step by Step Example ( How to Reproduce and verify ) the vulnerabilities :   ， 1. Unauthenticated Remote Command Injection.  ， The endpoint `/res.php` can be called remotely without user authentication as there is no cookie verification `Cookie : PHPSESSID=ID` to check if the request is legitimate. The second problem is that the POST parameter `id` can be injected to execute any Linux command. In the example below we create a crafted query that displays the contents of the `/etc/shadow` file.  ， The server returns a JSON response containing the contents of the `/etc/shadow` file. This command injection is due because there no sanitization check on the variable ` $ _POST [ \"id\" ] ` , line 65 , and can therefore take advantage of the `shell_exec (  ) ` function to execute unexpected arbitrary shell commands.  ， 2. Unauthenticated Directory Traversal.  ， The endpoint `/download.php` can be called remotely without user authentication as there is no cookie verification `Cookie : PHPSESSID=ID` to check if the request is legitimate. The second problem is that the GET parameter `file` can be injected with a relative file paths and download any files in the system. In the example below we create a crafted query that download the contents of the `/etc/passwd` file.",
