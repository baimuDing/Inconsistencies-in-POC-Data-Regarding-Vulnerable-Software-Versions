    "text": "title : Rocket Software Unidata 8.2.4 Build 3003 Buffer Overflow  ， detail : This Metasploit module exploits an authentication bypass vulnerability in the Linux version of udadmin_server , which is an RPC service that comes with the Rocket Software UniData server , which runs as root. This vulnerability affects UniData versions 8.2.4 build 3003 and earlier ( for Linux )  , but this module specifically targets UniData version 8.2.4 build 3001. Other versions will crash the forked process , but will not otherwise affect the RPC server. The username and password fields are copied to a stack-based buffer using a function that's equivalent to strcpy (  )  ( ie , has no bounds checking ) . Additionally , the password field is encoded in such a way that we can include NUL bytes.  ， cve : advisories | CVE-2023-28502  ，  ， desc :  #   ，  # This module requires Metasploit : https : /metasploit.com/download  ，  # Current source : https : /github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework  ，   ， 'Description' => %q{  ， This modlue exploits an authentication bypass vulnerability in the  ， Linux version of udadmin_server , which is an RPC service that comes  ， with the Rocket Software UniData server , which runs as root.  ， This vulnerability affects UniData versions 8.2.4 build 3003 and  ， earlier ( for Linux )  , but this module specifically targets UniData  ， version 8.2.4 build 3001.
