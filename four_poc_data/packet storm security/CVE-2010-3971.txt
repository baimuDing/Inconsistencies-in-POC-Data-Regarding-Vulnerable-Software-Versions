    "text": "date_time:Feb 10, 2011 ， title:Internet Explorer CSS Recursive Import Use After Free  ， detail:This Metasploit module exploits a memory corruption vulnerability within Microsoft's HTML engine (mshtml). When parsing an HTML page containing a recursive CSS import, a C+ object is deleted and later reused. This leads to arbitrary code execution. This exploit utilizes a combination of heap spraying and the .NET 2.0 'mscorie.dll' module to bypass DEP and ASLR. This Metasploit module does not opt-in to ASLR. As such, this module should be reliable on all Windows versions with .NET 2.0.50727 installed.  ， cve:advisories | CVE-2010-3971, OSVDB-69796  ， date_time:Feb 10, 2011  ， desc:#  ， # $Id: ms11_003_ie_css_import.rb 11730 2011-02-08 23:31:44Z jduck $  ，   ， # This file is part of the Metasploit Framework and may be subject to  ， # redistribution and commercial restrictions.
