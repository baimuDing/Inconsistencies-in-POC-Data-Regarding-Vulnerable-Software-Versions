    "text": "title : PRTG Network Monitor Remote Code Execution  ， detail : This Metasploit module exploits an authenticated remote code execution vulnerability in PRTG Network Monitor. Notifications can be created by an authenticated user and can execute scripts when triggered. Due to a poorly validated input on the script name , it is possible to chain it with a user-supplied command allowing command execution under the context of privileged user. The module uses provided credentials to log in to the web interface , then creates and triggers a malicious notification to perform remote code execution using a Powershell payload. It may require a few tries to get a shell because notifications are queued up on the server. This vulnerability affects versions prior to 18.2.39.  ， cve : advisories | CVE-2018-9276  ，  ， desc :  #   ，  # This module requires Metasploit : https : /metasploit.com/download  ，  # Current source : https : /github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework  ，  ， require 'msf/core/exploit/powershell'",
