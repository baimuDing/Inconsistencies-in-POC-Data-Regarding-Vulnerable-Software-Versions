    "text": "date_time:Sep 3, 2014 ， title:Mozilla Firefox Secret Leak  ， detail:The recent release of Firefox 32 fixes another interesting image parsing issue found by afl. Following a refactoring of memory management code, the past few versions of the browser ended up using uninitialized memory for certain types of truncated images, which is easily measurable with a simple <canvas> + toDataURL() harness that examines all the fuzzer-generated test cases. Depending on a variety of factors, problems like that may leak secrets across web origins, or more prosaically, may help attackers bypass security measures such as ASLR. This code is a proof of concept for versions prior to 32.  ， cve:advisories | CVE-2014-1564  ， date_time:Sep 3, 2014  ， desc:<style>  ， body {  ， background-color: #d0d0d0;  ， }  ， img {  ， border: 1px solid teal;  ， margin: 1ex;  ， }  ， canvas {  ， border: 1px solid crimson;  ， margin: 1ex;  ， }  ， </style>"
