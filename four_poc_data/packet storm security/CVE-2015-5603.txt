    "text": "title : Atlassian HipChat for Jira Plugin Velocity Template Injection  ， detail : Atlassian Hipchat is a web service for internal instant messaging. A plugin is available for Jira that allows team collaboration at real time. A message can be used to inject Java code into a Velocity template , and gain code execution as Jira. Authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability , and you must make sure the account you're using isn't protected by captcha. By default , Java payload will be used because it is cross-platform , but you can also specify which native payload you want ( Linux or Windows ) . HipChat for Jira plugin versions between 1.3.2 and 6.30.0 are affected. Jira versions between 6.3.5 and 6.4.10 are also affected by default , because they were bundled with a vulnerable copy of HipChat. When using the check command , if you supply a valid username and password , the module will be able to trigger the bug and check more accurately. If not , it falls back to passive , which can only tell if the target is running on a Jira version that is bundled with a vulnerable copy of Hipchat by default , which is less reliable. This vulnerability was originally discovered internally by Atlassian.  ， cve : advisories | CVE-2015-5603  ，  ， desc :  #   ，  # This module requires Metasploit : http : /metasploit.com/download  ，  # Current source : https : /github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework  ，  ， require 'msf/core'  ， require 'json'",
