Some  ， components have been spot-checked , while others have not been tested at all.  ， An attacker can get unauthorized access to the appliance and plant backdoors or  ， access configuration files containing credentials for other systems ( eg. Active  ， Directory/FTP login ) which can be used in further attacks.  ， Since all web traffic passes through the appliance , interception of HTTP as  ， well as the plaintext form of HTTPS traffic ( if HTTPS Scanning feature in use )  ,   ， including sensitive information like passwords and session Cookies is possible.  ， If HTTPS Scanning is enabled , the appliance holds a private key for a  ， Certificate Authority ( CA ) certificate that is installed/trusted on all  ， workstations in the company. If this private key is compromised by an attacker ,   ， arbitrary certificates can be signed. These certificates will then pass  ， validation on the client machines , enabling in various attacks targeting  ， clients ( MITM , phishing , evilgrade , . ) .  ， The recommendation of SEC Consult is to switch off the product until a  ， comprehensive security audit based on a security source code review has been  ， performed and all identified security deficiencies have been resolved by the  ， vendor.  ， Vulnerability overview/description :   ，  ， 1 ) Unauthenticated local file disclosure ( CVE-2013-2641 )   ， Unauthenticated users can read arbitrary files from the filesystem with the  ， privileges of the \"spiderman\" operating system user. These files include  ， configuration files containing sensitive information such as clear text  ， passwords which can be used in other attacks.  ， Furthermore the webserver log file which holds valid PHP session IDs can be  ， accessed. With this information administrator users can be impersonated.  ， 2 ) OS command injection ( CVE-2013-2642 )   ， Authenticated users can execute arbitrary commands on the underlying  ， operating system with the privileges of the \"spiderman\" operating system user.  ， This can be used to get persistent access to the affected system ( eg. by  ， planting backdoors )  , accessing all kinds locally stored information or  ， intercepting web traffic that passes through the appliance.  ， Unauthenticated users can exploit this kind of vulnerability too ( depends on  ， appliance configuration ) .  ， 3 ) Reflected Cross Site Scripting ( XSS )  ( CVE-2013-2643 )   ， Reflected Cross Site Scripting vulnerabilities were found. An attacker can use  ， these vulnerabilities the exploit other vulnerabilities in the web interface  ， or conducting phishing attacks.",
