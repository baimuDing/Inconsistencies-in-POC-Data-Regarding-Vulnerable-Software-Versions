Our passion lies in actively promoting the  ， energy transition with innovative ideas and pioneering products. And ,   ， because we dont do things by halves , our unwavering ambition is to create  ， integrated solutions that enable you to enjoy the highest possible degree  ， of independence and sustainability through self-generation of solar  ， electricity.  ， About SENEC Home :   ， SENEC.Home : The smart electricity storage device for your home  ， SENEC.Home is the heart of the your sustainable , affordable supply of solar  ， electricity. The smart battery storage device stores excess electricity  ， generated by your PV system so that you can use it when you need it such as  ， when your households energy consumption rises in the evening , or on rainy days  ， when your PV system generates less power.  ，  ， Vulnerability Details :   ， The management interface of the SENEC.Inverter is publicly accessible via the  ， Internet. This circumstance is recommended by the manufacturer and customers are  ， advised to open the necessary ports to enable remote maintenance.  ， As a result , anyone who manages to detect and successfully exploit security  ， vulnerabilities in SENEC.Inverter , for instance the authors of this report , can  ， access and compromise all devices available on the internet without  ， restrictions. To achieve this , it is possible to use an IoT search engine such as  ， Shodan to automatically obtain an up-to-date list of IP addresses of all devices  ， in just a few seconds.  ， Besides Shodan , there are other IoT search engines such as Censys or ZoomEye to  ， complement the list even further.  ， Consequently , it is very easy for an attacker to develop an exploit script for  ， the automated compromise of all SENEC.Inverter devices , e.g. to simul-  ， taneously shut down all appliances or to damage them through a targeted  ， overload. For this purpose , only the hard-coded credentials previously  ， identified in findings CVE-2023-39168 and CVE-2023-39169 need to be used in  ， conjunction with SENEC.Inverters built-in API.  ，  ， Proof of Concept ( PoC )  :   ， The attack consists of the following steps :   ， 1. use the shodan dork to obtain management-interfaces.  ，  ( no longer valid , patched by manufacturer )   ， https : /www.shodan.io/search?query=http.html%3A%3Ctitle%3ESENEC%3C%2Ftitle%  ， 3E  ，  ， Solution :   ， Patched by Manufacturer  ，  ( Rolled out until September 11 , 2023 ) ",
