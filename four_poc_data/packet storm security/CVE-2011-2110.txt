    "text": "title : Adobe Flash Player AVM Verification Logic Array Indexing Code Execution  ， detail : This Metasploit module exploits a vulnerability in Adobe Flash Player versions 10.3.181.23 and earlier. This issue is caused by a failure in the ActionScript3 AVM2 verification logic. This results in unsafe JIT ( Just-In-Time ) code being executed. This is the same vulnerability that was used for attacks against Korean based organizations. Specifically , this issue occurs when indexing an array using an arbitrary value , memory can be referenced and later executed. Taking advantage of this issue does not rely on heap spraying as the vulnerability can also be used for information leakage. Currently this exploit works for IE6 , IE7 , IE8 , Firefox 10.2 and likely several other browsers under multiple Windows platforms. This exploit bypasses ASLR/DEP and is very reliable.  ， cve : advisories | CVE-2011-2110 , OSVDB-48268  ，  ， desc :  #   ，  #  $ Id $   ，   ，  # This file is part of the Metasploit Framework and may be subject to  ，  # redistribution and commercial restrictions.
