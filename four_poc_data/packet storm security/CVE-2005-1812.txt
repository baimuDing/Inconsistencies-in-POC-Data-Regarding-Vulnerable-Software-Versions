    "text": "title : FutureSoft TFTP Server 2000 Transfer-Mode Overflow  ， detail : This Metasploit module exploits a stack overflow in the FutureSoft TFTP Server 2000 product. By sending an overly long transfer-mode string , we were able to overwrite both the SEH and the saved EIP. A subsequent write-exception that will occur allows the transferring of execution to our shellcode via the overwritten SEH. This Metasploit module has been tested against Windows 2000 Professional and for some reason does not seem to work against Windows 2000 Server ( could not trigger the overflow at all ) .  ， cve : advisories | CVE-2005-1812  ，  ， desc :  #   ，  #  $ Id $   ，   ，  # This file is part of the Metasploit Framework and may be subject to  ，  # redistribution and commercial restrictions.
