Desautels  ， Researcher : Kevin Finisterre  ， Advisory ID : NETRAGARD-20091219  ， Product Name : Mac OS X Java Runtime  ， Product Version : < Java for Mac OS X 10.6 Update 1  ， Vendor Name : http : /www.apple.com , http : /www.sun.com  ， Type of Vulnerability : Buffer Overflow  ， Impact : Arbitrary Code Execution  ， Vendor Notified : Yes  ， Patch Released : http : /support.apple.com/kb/HT3969  ， Discovery Date : 11/13/2009  ，  [ POSTING NOTICE ]   ，  ， If you intend to post this advisory on your web-site you must provide  ， a clickable link back to http : /www.netragard.com. The contents of  ， this advisory may be updated without notice.  ，  [ Product Description ]   ，  ， Mac OS X is the only major consumer operating system that comes complete  ， with a fully configured and ready-to-use Java runtime and development  ， environment. Professional Java developers are increasingly turning to  ， the feature-rich Mac OS X as the operating system of choice for both  ， Mac-based and cross-platform Java development projects. Mac OS X  ， includes  ， the full version of J2SE 1.5 , pre-installed with the Java Development  ， Kit ( JDK ) and the HotSpot virtual machine ( VM )  , so you don't have to  ， download , install , or configure anything.  ， Deploying Java applications on Mac OS X takes advantage of many built-in  ， features , including 64-bit support , resolution independence , automatic  ， support of multiprocessor hardware , native support for the Java  ， Accessibility API , and the native Aqua look and feel. As a result ,   ， Java applications on Mac OS X look and perform like native applications  ， on Mac OS X.  ，  [ Technical Summary ]   ，  ， On November 4th , 2009 ZDI-09-076 was released and subsequently credited  ， to 'Anonymous'. Given the historic track record with regards to lagging  ， behind 3rd party \"coordinated\" disclosures we decided to validate  ， wether or not OSX was vulnerable in its current state. More importantly  ， we wanted to validate that the vulnerable classes were reachable via  ， standard web browser.  ， The ZDI release contained limited information but that didn't prevent  ， us from creating a working Proof of Concept ( \"PoC\" ) for this issue.  ， As previously mentioned , the prime reason that we decided to look into  ， this  ， vulnerability was because we suspected that it was possible to remotely  ， trigger and exploit the risk via the Safari Web Browser. We were right.  ， The easiest way to validate this was to find an example applet that used  ， the getSoundbank (  ) function and then to modify  ， it.  ， A quick glance at the Sun manual page gave us a hint as to how to  ， use the function.  ， http : /java.sun.com/j2se/1.3/docs/api/javax/sound/midi/MidiSystem.html # getSoundbank ( java.net.URL )   ， public static Soundbank getSoundbank ( URL url )   ， throws InvalidMidiDataException , IOException  ， Constructs a Soundbank by reading it from the specified URL.  ， The URL must point to a valid MIDI soundbank file.  ， Parameters :   ， url - the source of the sound bank data  ， Returns :   ， the sound bank  ， Throws :   ， InvalidMidiDataException - if the URL does not point to valid MIDI  ， soundbank data recognized by the system  ， IOException - if an I/O error occurred when loading the soundbank  ， We used a google query to find an example :   ， http : /www.google.com/search?hl=en&source=hp&q=javax.sound.midi+getSoundbank+applet&aq=f&oq=&aqi=  ， Luckily the example was an applet which eliminates the question of  ， accessibility to the vulnerability via applet tag.  ， http : /music.columbia.edu/pipermail/jmsl/2004-November/000555.html  ， If you modify the above code example we can trigger the bug and get  ， and some additional information about it.  ， All of the testing below was done with appletviewer and the following  ， html page , coupled with our compiled proof of concept class.  ，  $ cat index.html",
