Privs. : post auth  ， CVE : CVE-2016-3115  ， Description  ，  ， quote website [ 1 ]   ， >OpenSSH is the premier connectivity tool for remote login with the SSH protocol. It encrypts all traffic to eliminate eavesdropping , connection hijacking , and other attacks. In addition , OpenSSH provides a large suite of secure tunneling capabilities , several authentication methods , and sophisticated configuration options.  ， Summary  ，  ， An authenticated user may inject arbitrary xauth commands by sending an  ， x11 channel request that includes a newline character in the x11 cookie.  ， The newline acts as a command separator to the xauth binary. This attack requires  ， the server to have 'X11Forwarding yes' enabled. Disabling it , mitigates this vector.  ， By injecting xauth commands one gains limited * read/write arbitrary files ,   ， information leakage or xauth-connect capabilities. These capabilities can be  ， leveraged by an authenticated restricted user - e.g. one with the login shell  ， configured as /bin/false or one with configured forced-commands - to bypass  ， account restriction. This is generally not expected.  ， The injected xauth commands are performed with the effective permissions of the  ， logged in user as the sshd already dropped its privileges.  ， Quick-Info :   ，  * requires : X11Forwarding yes  ，  * bypasses /bin/false and forced-commands  ，  * OpenSSH does not treat /bin/false like /bin/nologin ( in contrast to Dropbear )   ，  * does not bypass /bin/nologin ( as there is special treatment for this )   ， Capabilities ( xauth )  :   ，  * Xauth",
