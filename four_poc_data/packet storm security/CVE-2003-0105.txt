Detailed exploitation given.  ， cve : advisories | CVE-2003-0105  ，  ， desc : - Corsaire Security Advisory -  ， Title : Port80 Software ServerMask inconsistencies  ， Date : 24.02.03  ， Application : Port80 Software ServerMask 2.2 and prior  ， Environment : IIS 4 / IIS 5 / IIS 5.1  ， Author : Martin O'Neal [ martin.oneal @ corsaire.com ]   ， Audience : General distribution  ， Reference : c030224-001  ， - Scope -  ， The aim of this document is to clearly define some issues related to the  ， ServerMask product , as supplied by Port80 Software [ 1 ]   ， - History -  ， Discovered : 20.02.03 ( Martin O'Neal )   ， Vendor notified : 24.02.03  ， Document released : 10.08.04  ， The release process on this advisory has been drawn-out due to repeated  ， requests from Port80 , on the basis that a revised product which resolved  ， the issues would be available shortly. However , after eighteen months of  ， waiting ( during which time Port80 has continued to actively sell the  ， product ) it has become clear that no such fix is imminent.  ， This advisory has been publicly released without a vendor fix being  ， immediately available because the issues identified are not critical ,   ， and do not allow the host to be remotely compromised.  ， - Overview -  ， The ServerMask product is marketed as a solution for improving the  ， security of Microsoft IIS servers by obfuscating header fields within  ， HTTP responses :   ， \"ServerMask 2.0 removes or modifies unnecessary response data. The  ， software provides control over what Server header data , if any , is  ， visible in HTTP responses.\" [ 2 ]   ， In practise , ServerMask changes only a subset of the HTTP header fields ,   ， leaving a number of responses unmodified. These remaining headers still  ， provide reliable clues to the server being Microsoft IIS.  ， The stated goal of the product , anonymisation , is therefore not fully  ， achieved as only a subset of identifying traits are obfuscated.",
