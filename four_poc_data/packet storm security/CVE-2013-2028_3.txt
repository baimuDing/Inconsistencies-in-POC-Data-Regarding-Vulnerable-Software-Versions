    "text": "title : Nginx HTTP Server 1.3.9-1.4.0 Chunked Encoding Stack Buffer Overflow  ， detail : This Metasploit module exploits a stack buffer overflow in versions 1.3.9 to 1.4.0 of nginx. The exploit first triggers an integer overflow in the ngx_http_parse_chunked (  ) by supplying an overly long hex value as chunked block size. This value is later used when determining the number of bytes to read into a stack buffer , thus the overflow becomes possible.  ， cve : advisories | CVE-2013-2028 , OSVDB-93037  ，  ， desc :  #   ，  # This file is part of the Metasploit Framework and may be subject to  ，  # redistribution and commercial restrictions.
