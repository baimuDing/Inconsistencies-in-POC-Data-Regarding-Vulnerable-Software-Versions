This may include interfaces that are exposed to potentially hostile networks.  ， CWE-287 ( Improper Authentication )  : By default , the REST and memcache interfaces do not require authentication to access the cluster API to gain or inject information. Joining potentially rogue nodes to the cluster using the native Hazelcast API is possible by using a hardcoded password that's exposed by the source code.  ， CWE-200 ( Information Exposure )  : The cluster API exposes several critical information such as runtime data , network information. In cases where a distributed session storage is used , session information of logged in users may be accessed as well. Unnecessary APIs for memcache and REST are exposed.  ， Risk :   ， When running the Open-Xchange backend on a network that's directly attached to the Internet or other potentially hostile networks , an attacker may access and inject critical information. The exposed API could be used to influence systems availability by injecting arbitrary data or disconnect cluster nodes.",
