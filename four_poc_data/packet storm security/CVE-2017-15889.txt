    "text": "title : Synology DiskStation Manager smart.cgi Remote Command Execution  ， detail : This Metasploit module exploits a vulnerability found in Synology DiskStation Manager ( DSM ) versions prior to 5.2-5967-5 , which allows the execution of arbitrary commands under root privileges after website authentication. The vulnerability is located in webman/modules/StorageManager/smart.cgi , which allows appending of a command to the device to be scanned. However , the command with drive is limited to 30 characters. A somewhat valid drive name is required , thus /dev/sd is used , even though it does not exist. To circumvent the character restriction , a wget input file is staged in /a , and executed to download our payload to /b. From there the payload is executed. A wfsdelay is required to give time for the payload to download , and the execution of it to run.  ， cve : advisories | CVE-2017-15889  ，  ， desc :  #   ，  # This module requires Metasploit : https : /metasploit.com/download  ，  # Current source : https : /github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework  ，   ， 'Description' => %q{  ， This module exploits a vulnerability found in Synology DiskStation Manager ( DSM )   ， versions < 5.2-5967-5 , which allows the execution of arbitrary commands under root  ， privileges after website authentication.  ， The vulnerability is located in webman/modules/StorageManager/smart.cgi , which  ， allows appending of a command to the device to be scanned.
