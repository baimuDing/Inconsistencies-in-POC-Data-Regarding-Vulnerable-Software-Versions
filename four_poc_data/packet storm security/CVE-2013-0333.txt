    "text": "title : Ruby on Rails JSON Processor YAML Deserialization Code Execution  ， detail : This Metasploit module exploits a remote code execution vulnerability in the JSON request processor of the Ruby on Rails application framework. This vulnerability allows an attacker to instantiate a remote object , which in turn can be used to execute any ruby code remotely in the context of the application. This vulnerability is very similar to CVE-2013-0156. This Metasploit module has been tested successfully on RoR 3.0.9 , 3.0.19 , and 2.3.15. The technique used by this module requires the target to be running a fairly recent version of Ruby 1.9 ( since 2011 or so ) . Applications using Ruby 1.8 may still be exploitable using the init_with (  ) method , but this has not been demonstrated.  ， cve : advisories | CVE-2013-0333  ，  ， desc :  #   ，  # This file is part of the Metasploit Framework and may be subject to  ，  # redistribution and commercial restrictions.
