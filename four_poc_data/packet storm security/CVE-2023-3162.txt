This is due to insufficient verification on the user being supplied during a Stripe checkout through the plugin. This allows unauthenticated attackers to log in as users who have orders , who are typically customers.  ， Technical Analysis  ， The Stripe Payment Plugin for WooCommerce , according to its settings , integrates various Stripe payment methods. By default , the plugin provides inline payments , which means that customers can complete their transactions directly on the WordPress website without being redirected to the Stripe website.  ， However , the plugin also provides an option for checkout redirection. This means that customers can choose to be redirected to the Stripe website to complete their payment process. This allows them to have a familiar and secure payment experience on the Stripe platform. To enable the checkout redirection option , you would need to configure the plugin settings accordingly.  ， Examining the code reveals that Stripe Checkout has an order cancellation link. If the customer cancels the payment , they will be returned to the WordPress website.  ，  [ VIEW THIS CODE SNIPPET ON THE BLOG ]   ， The vulnerable 'eh_spg_stripe_cancel_order' function  ， If the link contains the createaccount parameter and its value is true , the plugin will log the customer in based on the order id , without any authentication. This means that it is possible to create a link that automatically logs into any user account associated with an order.  ， An attacker is limited to what users they can log in as due to the fact that it is only possible to login as a user with an order. Considering the requirement of an order , in most cases an attacker will only be able to log in as a customer-level user. However , it is common for shop managers or administrators to create test orders in order to verify order functionality. In these cases there is a chance that by exploiting the authentication bypass vulnerability , an attacker can gain access to an administrative user account , or another higher-level user account.  ， The normal order process looks like this :   ， woo-stripe-checkout-howto-wordfence  ， The exploit process looks like this :   ， woo-stripe-checkout-exploit-howto-wordfence",
