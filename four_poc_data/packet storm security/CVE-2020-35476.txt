    "text": "title : OpenTSDB 2.4.0 Command Injection  ， detail : This Metasploit module exploits an unauthenticated command injection vulnerability in the yrange parameter in OpenTSDB through 2.4.0 ( CVE-2020-35476 ) in order to achieve unauthenticated remote code execution as the root user. The module first attempts to obtain the OpenTSDB version via the api. If the version is 2.4.0 or lower , the module performs additional checks to obtain the configured metrics and aggregators. It then randomly selects one metric and one aggregator and uses those to instruct the target server to plot a graph. As part of this request , the yrange parameter is set to the payload , which will then be executed by the target if the latter is vulnerable. This module has been successfully tested against OpenTSDB version 2.3.0.  ， cve : advisories | CVE-2020-35476  ，  ， desc :  #   ，  # This module requires Metasploit : https : /metasploit.com/download  ，  # Current source : https : /github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework  ，   ， 'Description' => %q{  ， This module exploits an unauthenticated command injection  ， vulnerability in the yrange parameter in OpenTSDB through  ， 2.4.0 ( CVE-2020-35476 ) in order to achieve unauthenticated  ， remote code execution as the root user.  ， The module first attempts to obtain the OpenTSDB version via  ， the api.
