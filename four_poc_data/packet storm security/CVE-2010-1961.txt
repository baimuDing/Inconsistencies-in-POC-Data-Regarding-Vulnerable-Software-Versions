    "text": "title : HP OpenView Network Node Manager ovwebsnmpsrv.exe main Buffer Overflow  ， detail : This Metasploit module exploits a stack buffer overflow in HP OpenView Network Node Manager 7.53 prior to NNM_01203. By specifying a long 'arg' parameter when executing the 'jovgraph.exe' CGI program , an attacker can cause a stack-based buffer overflow and execute arbitrary code. This vulnerability is triggerable via either a GET or POST request. The buffer being written to is 1024 bytes in size. It is important to note that this vulnerability must be exploited by overwriting SEH. Otherwise , CVE-2010-1961 is triggered ! The vulnerable code is within the \"main\" function within \"ovwebsnmpsrv.exe\" with a timestamp prior to April 7th , 2010. There are no stack cookies , so exploitation is easily achieved by overwriting SEH structures. There exists some unreliability when running this exploit. It is not completely clear why at this time , but may be related to OVWDB or session management. Also , on some attempts OV NNM may report invalid characters in the URL. It is not clear what is causing this either.  ， cve : advisories | CVE-2010-1964 , OSVDB-65552  ，  ， desc :  #   ，  #  $ Id : hp_nnm_ovwebsnmpsrv_main.rb 12097 2011-03-23 15 : 45 : 48Z jduck $   ，   ，  # This file is part of the Metasploit Framework and may be subject to  ，  # redistribution and commercial restrictions.
