    "text": "title : hplip hpssd.py From Address Arbitrary Command Execution  ， detail : This Metasploit module exploits a command execution vulnerable in the hpssd.py daemon of the Hewlett-Packard Linux Imaging and Printing Project. According to MITRE , versions 1.x and 2.x before 2.7.10 are vulnerable. This Metasploit module was written and tested using the Fedora 6 Linux distribution. On the test system , the daemon listens on localhost only and runs with root privileges. Although the configuration shows the daemon is to listen on port 2207 , it actually listens on a dynamic port. NOTE : If the target system does not have a 'sendmail' command installed , this vulnerability cannot be exploited.  ， cve : advisories | CVE-2007-5208  ，  ， desc :  #   ，  #  $ Id : hplip_hpssd_exec.rb 8511 2010-02-16 00 : 27 : 45Z jduck $   ，   ，  # This file is part of the Metasploit Framework and may be subject to  ，  # redistribution and commercial restrictions.
