    "text": "title : Microsoft IIS 4.0 .HTR Path Overflow  ， detail : This exploits a buffer overflow in the ISAPI ISM.DLL used to process HTR scripting in IIS 4.0. This Metasploit module works against Windows NT 4 Service Packs 3 , 4 , and 5. The server will continue to process requests until the payload being executed has exited. If you've set EXITFUNC to 'seh' , the server will continue processing requests , but you will have trouble terminating a bind shell. If you set EXITFUNC to thread , the server will crash upon exit of the bind shell. The payload is alpha-numerically encoded without a NOP sled because otherwise the data gets mangled by the filters.  ， cve : advisories | CVE-1999-0874  ，  ， desc :  #   ，  #  $ Id $   ，   ，  # This file is part of the Metasploit Framework and may be subject to  ，  # redistribution and commercial restrictions.
