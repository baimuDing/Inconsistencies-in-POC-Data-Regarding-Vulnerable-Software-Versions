    "text": "title : Mac OS X libxpc MITM Privilege Escalation  ， detail : This Metasploit module exploits a vulnerability in libxpc on macOS versions 10.13.3 and below. The task_set_special_port API allows callers to overwrite their bootstrap port , which is used to communicate with launchd. This port is inherited across forks : child processes will use the same bootstrap port as the parent. By overwriting the bootstrap port and forking a child processes , we can now gain a MitM position between our child and launchd. To gain root we target the sudo binary and intercept its communication with opendirectoryd , which is used by sudo to verify credentials. We modify the replies from opendirectoryd to make it look like our password was valid.  ， cve : advisories | CVE-2018-4237  ，  ， desc :  #   ，  # This module requires Metasploit : https : /metasploit.com/download  ，  # Current source : https : /github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework",
