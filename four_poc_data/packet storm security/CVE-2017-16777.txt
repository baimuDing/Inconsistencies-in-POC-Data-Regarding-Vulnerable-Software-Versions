Not quite so serious this  ，  # time - this one is only exploitable if the user has the plugin installed but  ，  # VMware Fusion * not * installed. This is a fairly unlikely scenario but it's a  ，  # straight to root privesc with no user interaction so isn't the kind of thing  ，  # that should be shipping with any software.  ，   ，  # This occurs because the suid root sudo helper that I have discussed in previous  ，  # exploit writeups executes /Applications/VMware  ，  # Fusion.app/Contents/Library/vmnet-cli  ，  # as root , but if the application isn't installed and we're a local admin user we  ，  # can create a fake app directory with a payload in place of vmnet-cli that gets  ，  # executed as root.  ，   ，  # HashiCorp fixed this ( very quickly ) in 5.0.4.  ，   ，  # https : /m4.rkw.io/vagrant_vmware_privesc_5.0.3.sh.txt  ，  # 3c11083386b3f7352d60b327190eed4364383c0622351db5410d809f4bda746a",
