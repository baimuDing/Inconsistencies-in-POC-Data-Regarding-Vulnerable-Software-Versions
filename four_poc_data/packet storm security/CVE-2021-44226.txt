    "text": "title : Razer Synapse 3.6.x DLL Hijacking  ， detail : Razer Synapse versions prior to 3.7.0228.022817 suffer from a dll hijacking vulnerability.  ， cve : advisories | CVE-2021-44226  ，  ， desc : Advisory ID : SYSS-2021-058  ， Product : Razer Synapse  ， Manufacturer : Razer Inc.  ， Affected Version ( s )  : Versions prior to 3.7.0228.022817  ， Tested Version ( s )  : 3.6.0920.091710 , 3.6.1010.101113 ,   ， 3.6.1018.101823 ,   ， 3.6.1130.111217 , 3.6.1201.111814 ,   ， 3.7.0131.011810  ， Vulnerability Type : Improper Privilege Management ( CWE-269 )   ， Risk Level : Critical  ， Solution Status : Fixed  ， Manufacturer Notification : 2021-10-18  ， Solution Date : 2022-03-07  ， Public Disclosure : 2022-03-23  ， CVE Reference : CVE-2021-44226  ， Authors of Advisory : Dr. Oliver Schwarz , SySS GmbH  ， Matthias Deeg , SySS GmbH  ，  ， Overview :   ， Razer Synapse is an additional driver software for Razer gaming devices.  ， The manufacturer describes the product as a \"unified cloud-based hardware  ， configuration tool\" ( see [ 1 ]  ) .  ， Due to an unsafe installation path and improper privilege management ,   ， the associated system service \"Razer Synapse Service\" is vulnerable to  ， DLL hijacking.  ， As a result , local Windows users can abuse the Razer driver installer to  ， obtain administrative privileges on Windows.  ， In order to exploit the vulnerability , the attacker needs physical  ， access to the machine and needs to prepare the attack before Razer  ， Synapse is installed along with a Razer driver.  ，  ， Vulnerability Details :   ， The attack scenario considers a Windows machine without any previous  ， installation of any Razer device or software.  ， The attacker has a local unprivileged Windows account , physical access  ， to the machine , and a device which is either a Razer peripheral or able  ， to pretend to be one ( such as a Bash Bunny or a Raspberry Pi Zero ) .  ， The attacker aims at executing code with full system privileges.  ， The attack exploits the Razer Synapse Service which runs with elevated  ， privileges. While the main binary of the service is stored in the  ， protected location \"C : \\Program Files ( x86 ) \\Razer\\Synapse3\\Service\" , it  ， dynamically loads libraries from  ， \"C : \\ProgramData\\Razer\\Synapse3\\Service\\bin\".  ， Before the installation , standard users can write to this path , since  ， \"C : \\ProgramData\" is world-writable on a standard installation of Windows.  ， The Synapse installation procedure changes access privileges , so that  ， standard users cannot write to the path any longer. In addition , it  ， removes any previous files in that location.  ， Furthermore , upon service start , the location is checked for DLLs that  ， do not originate from Razer.  ， However , if the path is created before the driver installation , the  ， creator remains owner of the object and can still change directory and  ， file permissions. In particular , the creator can deny access for the  ， SYSTEM user and grant access for the attacker's user.  ， The attack consists of three phases :   ， 1. Before the installation of the driver/Synapse , the attacker creates  ， \"C : \\ProgramData\\Razer\\Synapse3\\Service\" and denies write-access for  ， SYSTEM.  ， 2. Afterwards , the attacker triggers the installation of Synapse.  ， This can be done without any elevated privileges by plugging in a  ， Razer device and following the installation procedure for Synapse ,   ，  ， Alternatively , a device such as Bash Bunny or a Raspberry Pi Zero  ， can be used and pretend to be a Razer device.  ， 3. After the installation of Synapse has finished , the attacker grants  ， full access to \"C : \\ProgramData\\Razer\\Synapse3\" for both the SYSTEM  ， user and the own low-privileged user account. Afterwards , the  ， attacker places a prepared set of DLLs into  ， \"C : \\ProgramData\\Razer\\Synapse3\\Service\\bin\" and restarts the Razer  ， Synapse Service , typically , by restarting the machine.  ， SySS GmbH chose the following set of DLLs for a proof of concept :   ，  * RzLightingEngine.dll from the original installation  ，  * RSy3_LightingEffects.dll from the original installation  ，  * userenv_orig.dll , a copy from the standard Windows DLL at  ， \"C : \\Windows\\SysWOW64\\userenv.dll\"  ，  * userenv.dll , a malicious 32-bit DLL that creates a new admin user  ， and redirects to userenv_orig.dll otherwise  ， The attack has been successfully tested for the following versions of  ， Razer Synapse :   ，  * 3.6.0920.091710  ，  * 3.6.1010.101113  ，  * 3.6.1018.101823  ，  * 3.6.1130.111217  ，  * 3.6.1201.111814  ， A modified version of the exploit has been successfully tested  ， against version 3.7.0131.011810.  ， The attack has been successfully tested on the following versions of  ， Windows :   ，  * Windows 10 Enterprise 20H2 19042.1237  ，  * Windows 10 Pro 20H2 19042.1237  ，  * Windows 10 Pro 21H1 19043.1237  ，  * Windows 10 Pro 21H1 19043.1266  ，  ， Solution :   ， Razer has published a patched version that will be deployed automatically  ， upon driver installation on current Windows builds.  ， To prevent similar attacks through other co-installers , system  ， administrators can disable them by setting the following key in the",
