    "text": "title : Wireshark LWRES Dissector getaddrsbyname_request Buffer Overflow ( loop )   ， detail : The LWRES dissector in Wireshark version 0.9.15 through 1.0.10 and 1.2.0 through 1.2.5 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code due to a stack-based buffer overflow. This bug found and reported by babi. This particular exploit targets the dissect_getaddrsbyname_request function. Several other functions also contain potentially exploitable stack-based buffer overflows. The Windows version ( of 1.2.5 at least ) is compiled with /GS , which prevents exploitation via the return address on the stack. Sending a larger string allows exploitation using the SEH bypass method. However , this packet will usually get fragmented , which may cause additional complications. NOTE : The vulnerable code is reached only when the packet dissection is rendered. If the packet is fragmented , all fragments must be captured and reassembled to exploit this issue. This version loops , sending the packet every X seconds until the job is killed.  ， cve : advisories | CVE-2010-0304  ，  ， desc :  #   ，  #  $ Id : wireshark_lwres_getaddrbyname.rb 8364 2010-02-03 18 : 24 : 42Z jduck $   ，   ，  # This file is part of the Metasploit Framework and may be subject to  ，  # redistribution and commercial restrictions.
