The player is a browser plugin for IE ( ActiveX ) and Firefox ( dll ) . When an unsuspecting user visits a web page referring to a specially crafted .dxstudio document , an attacker can execute arbitrary commands. Testing was conducted using plugin version 3.0.29.0 for Firefox 2.0.0.20 and IE 6 on Windows XP SP3. In IE , the user will be prompted if they wish to allow the plug-in to access local files. This prompt appears to occur only once per server host.
