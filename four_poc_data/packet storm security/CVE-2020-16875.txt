    "text": "title : Microsoft Exchange Server DlpUtils AddTenantDlpPolicy Remote Code Execution  ， detail : This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of Exchange Server. Authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability. Additionally , the target user must have the \"Data Loss Prevention\" role assigned and an active mailbox. If the user is in the \"Compliance Management\" or greater \"Organization Management\" role groups , then they have the \"Data Loss Prevention\" role. Since the user who installed Exchange is in the \"Organization Management\" role group , they transitively have the \"Data Loss Prevention\" role. The specific flaw exists within the processing of the New-DlpPolicy cmdlet. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied template data when creating a DLP policy. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of SYSTEM. Tested against Exchange Server 2016 CU14 on Windows Server 2016.  ， cve : advisories | CVE-2020-16875  ，  ， desc :  #   ，  # This module requires Metasploit : https : /metasploit.com/download  ，  # Current source : https : /github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework  ，   ， 'Description' => %q{  ， This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code  ， on affected installations of Exchange Server.
