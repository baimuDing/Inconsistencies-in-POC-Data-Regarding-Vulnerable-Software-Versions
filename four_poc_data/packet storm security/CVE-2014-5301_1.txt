    "text": "title : ManageEngine Multiple Products Authenticated File Upload  ， detail : This Metasploit module exploits a directory traversal vulnerability in ManageEngine ServiceDesk , AssetExplorer , SupportCenter and IT360 when uploading attachment files. The JSP that accepts the upload does not handle correctly './' sequences , which can be abused to write in the file system. Authentication is needed to exploit this vulnerability , but this module will attempt to login using the default credentials for the administrator and guest accounts. Alternatively you can provide a pre-authenticated cookie or a username / password combo. For IT360 targets enter the RPORT of the ServiceDesk instance ( usually 8400 ) . All versions of ServiceDesk prior v9 build 9031 ( including MSP but excluding v4 )  , AssetExplorer , SupportCenter and IT360 ( including MSP ) are vulnerable. At the time of release of this module , only ServiceDesk v9 has been fixed in build 9031 and above. This Metasploit module has been been tested successfully in Windows and Linux on several versions.  ， cve : advisories | CVE-2014-5301  ，  ， desc :  #   ，  # This module requires Metasploit : http : /metasploit.com/download  ，  # Current source : https : /github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework  ，  ， require 'msf/core'",
