    "text": "title : Apache Tomcat Privilege Escalation  ， detail : This Metasploit module exploits a vulnerability in RedHat based systems where improper file permissions are applied to /usr/lib/tmpfiles.d/tomcat.conf for Apache Tomcat versions before 7.0.54-8. The configuration files in tmpfiles.d are used by systemd-tmpfiles to manage temporary files including their creation. With this weak permission , you are able to inject commands into the systemd-tmpfiles service to write a cron job to execute a payload. systemd-tmpfiles is executed by default on boot on RedHat-based systems through systemd-tmpfiles-setup.service. Depending on the system in use , the execution of systemd-tmpfiles could also be triggered by other services , cronjobs , startup scripts etc. This module was tested against Tomcat 7.0.54-3 on Fedora 21.  ， cve : advisories | CVE-2016-5425  ，  ， desc :  #   ，  ，  # This exploit sample shows how an exploit module could be written to exploit  ，  # a bug in a command on a linux computer for priv esc.  ，   ，  ， 'Description' => %q{  ， This module exploits a vulnerability in RedHat based systems where  ， improper file permissions are applied to /usr/lib/tmpfiles.d/tomcat.conf  ，  ， The configuration files in tmpfiles.d are used by systemd-tmpfiles to manage  ， temporary files including their creation.  ， With this weak permission , we're able to inject commands into systemd-tmpfiles  ， service to write a cron job to execute our payload.  ， systemd-tmpfiles is executed by default on boot on RedHat-based systems  ， through systemd-tmpfiles-setup.service.
