An authenticated user can abuse this servlet to upload a WAR to the Apache Tomcat webapps directory and achieve remote code execution as root. This module exploits two other vulnerabilities , CVE-2019-1619 for authentication bypass on versions 10.4 ( 2 ) and below , and CVE-2019-1622 ( information disclosure ) to obtain the correct directory for the WAR file upload. This module was tested on the DCNM Linux virtual appliance 10.4 ( 2 )  , 11.0 ( 1 ) and 11.1 ( 1 )  , and should work on a few versions below 10.4 ( 2 ) . Only version 11.0 ( 1 ) requires authentication to exploit ( see References to understand why ) .  ， cve : advisories | CVE-2019-1619 , CVE-2019-1620 , CVE-2019-1622  ，  ， desc :  #   ，  # This module requires Metasploit : https : /metasploit.com/download  ，  # Current source : https : /github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework",
