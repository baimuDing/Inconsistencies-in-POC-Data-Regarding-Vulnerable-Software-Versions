    "text": "title : Ionic Identity Vault 5.0.4 PIN Unlock Lockout Bypass  ， detail : Ionic Identity Vault versions 5.0.4 and below suffer from a PIN unlock lockout bypass vulnerability on both Android and iOS.  ， cve : advisories | CVE-2021-44033  ，  ， desc :  #   ，  ，  # COMPASS SECURITY ADVISORY  ，  # https : /www.compass-security.com/research/advisories/  ，   ，  ，  # Product : Identity Vault  ，  # Vendor : Ionic  ，  # CSNC ID : CSNC-2021-020  ，  # CVE ID : CVE-2021-44033  ，  # Subject : PIN Unlock Lockout Bypass ( Android & iOS )   ，  # Severity : Medium  ，  # Effect : Authentication Bypass  ，  # Author : Emanuel Duss <emanuel.duss @ compass-security.com>  ，  # Date : 2021-11-19  ，   ， Introduction  ，  ， Ionic Identity Vault is a secure storage solution for Android and iOS mobile  ， apps which can e.g. be used to store authentication information like access  ， tokens [ 1 ] . This information can be protected , so that the user must  ， authenticate first , before the information is unlocked.  ， Identity Vault provides different authentication methods :   ， - Memory only storage ( not persisted at all )   ， - Secure storage ( without user authentication )   ， - Passcode ( PIN ) authentication  ， - Biometric authentication ( optionally with device PIN fallback )   ， The Passcode ( PIN ) authentication mechanism can be configured with a lockout  ， counter , which will clear the secure storage after a specified number of failed  ， unlocks.  ， During a customer project , we could bypass the PIN unlock lockout mechanism.  ， This allows an attacker with physical access to the device to brute force all  ， possible unlock PIN combinations without being blocked.  ， Affected  ，  ， - Vulnerable : Ionic Identity Vault <= 5.0.4  ， - Not vulnerable : Ionic Identity Vault >= 5.0.5  ， Description  ，  ， The failed unlock counter is only stored in memory and can therefore be  ， bypassed. An attacker with physical access to the phone is therefore able to  ， brute force the PIN of the user without being blocked.  ， For example , if the lockout threshold is set to 5 , an attacker can perform 4  ， failed unlocks and close the app to clear the failed unlock counter. The app can  ， then be opened again to get 4 more unlock attempts. This can be repeated until  ， the correct PIN was found.",
