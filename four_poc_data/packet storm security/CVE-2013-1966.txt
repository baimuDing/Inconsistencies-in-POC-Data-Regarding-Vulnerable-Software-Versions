    "text": "title : Apache Struts includeParams Remote Code Execution  ， detail : This Metasploit module exploits a remote command execution vulnerability in Apache Struts versions prior to 2.3.14.2. A specifically crafted request parameter can be used to inject arbitrary OGNL code into the stack bypassing Struts and OGNL library protections. When targeting an action which requires interaction through GET the payload should be split having into account the uri limits. In this case , if the rendered jsp has more than one point of injection , it could result in payload corruption. It should happen only when the payload is larger than the uri length.  ， cve : advisories | CVE-2013-2115 , CVE-2013-1966 , OSVDB-93645  ，  ， desc :  #   ，  # This file is part of the Metasploit Framework and may be subject to  ，  # redistribution and commercial restrictions.
