    "text": "title : Aerohive NetConfig 10.0r8a Local File Inclusion / Remote Code Execution  ， detail : This Metasploit module exploits local file inclusion and log poisoning vulnerabilities ( CVE-2020-16152 ) in Aerohive NetConfig , version 10.0r8a build-242466 and older in order to achieve unauthenticated remote code execution as the root user. NetConfig is the Aerohive/Extreme Networks HiveOS administrative webinterface. Vulnerable versions allow for LFI because they rely on a version of PHP 5 that is vulnerable to string truncation attacks. This module leverages this issue in conjunction with log poisoning to gain remote code execution as root. Upon successful exploitation , the Aerohive NetConfig application will hang for as long as the spawned shell remains open. Closing the session should render the application responsive again. The module provides an automatic cleanup option to clean the log. However , this option is disabled by default because any modifications to the /tmp/messages log , even via sed , may render the target ( temporarily ) unexploitable. This state can last over an hour. This module has been successfully tested against Aerohive NetConfig versions 8.2r4 and 10.0r7a.  ， cve : advisories | CVE-2020-16152  ，  ， desc :  #   ，  # This module requires Metasploit : https : /metasploit.com/download  ，  # Current source : https : /github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework  ，   ， 'Description' => %q{  ， This module exploits LFI and log poisoning vulnerabilities  ，  ( CVE-2020-16152 ) in Aerohive NetConfig , version 10.0r8a  ， build-242466 and older in order to achieve unauthenticated remote  ， code execution as the root user.
