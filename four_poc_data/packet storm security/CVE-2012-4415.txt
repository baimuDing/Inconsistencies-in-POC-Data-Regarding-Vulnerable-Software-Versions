In the Debian distribution the guacd 0.6.0-1 daemon runs as root and allows connections from unauthenticated users. However , it fortunately only listens on localhost by default. Proof of concept code included.  ， cve : advisories | CVE-2012-4415  ，  ， desc : Overview  ，  ， \"Guacamole is an HTML5 web application that provides access to desktop  ， environments using remote desktop protocols such as VNC or RDP. A  ， centralized server acts as a tunnel and proxy , allowing access to  ， multiple desktops through a web browser. No plugins are needed : the  ， client requires nothing more than a web browser supporting HTML5 and  ， AJAX.\"  ， - http : /guac-dev.org/  ， guacamole 0.6.0 contains a trivial buffer overflow vulnerability that  ， allows connected users to execute code with the privileges of the guacd  ， daemon. In the Debian distribution the guacd 0.6.0-1 daemon runs as root  ， and allows connections from unauthenticated users. However , it  ， fortunately only listens on localhost by default.  ， Analysis  ，  ， The server part of guacamole consists of a web application written in  ， Java and a proxy daemon ( \"guacd\" ) written in C. The proxy part parses  ， the guacamole protocol using the libguac library. This library contains  ， a trivial buffer overflow vulnerability. As you can see in the following  ， quote the code fails to validate the length of the user supplied input  ， before using strcpy to copy it to a fixed size buffer in stack : ",
