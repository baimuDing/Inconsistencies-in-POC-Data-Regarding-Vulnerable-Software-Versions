The second vulnerability lies within the image upload system provided to logged-in users ; there is no image validation function in the blogger to prevent an authenticated user from uploading any file type. The third vulnerability occurs within the blog comment functionality , allowing arbitrary files to be deleted.  ， cve : advisories | CVE-2005-2733  ，  ， desc :  #   ，  #  $ Id $   ，   ，  # This file is part of the Metasploit Framework and may be subject to  ，  # redistribution and commercial restrictions.
