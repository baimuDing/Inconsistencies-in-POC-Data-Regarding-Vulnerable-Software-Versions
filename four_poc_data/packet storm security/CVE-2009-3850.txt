Blender .blend project files can be modified to execute arbitrary commands without user intervention by design. An attacker can take full control of the machine where Blender is installed by sending a specially crafted .blend file and enticing the user to open it.  ， cve:advisories | CVE-2009-3850  ， date_time:Nov 5, 2009  ， desc:-BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-  ， Hash: SHA1  ，   ， Core Security Technologies - CoreLabs Advisory  ， http:/www.coresecurity.com/corelabs/  ， Blender .blend Project Arbitrary Command Execution  ， 1. *Advisory Information*  ， Title: Blender .blend Project Arbitrary Command Execution  ， Advisory Id: CORE-2009-0912  ， Advisory URL:  ， http:/www.coresecurity.com/content/blender-scripting-injection  ， Date published: 2009-11-05  ， Date of last update: 2009-11-04  ， Vendors contacted: Blender Foundation  ， Release mode: User release  ， 2. *Vulnerability Information*  ， Class: Failure to Sanitize Data into a Different Plane [CWE-74]  ， Impact: Code execution  ， Remotely Exploitable: Yes (client side)  ， Locally Exploitable: No  ， Bugtraq ID: 36838  ， CVE Name: CVE-2009-3850  ， 3. *Vulnerability Description*  ， Blender [2] is a 3D graphics application released as free software. It  ， can be used for modeling, texturing, rendering, particle, and other  ， simulations and creating interactive 3D applications, including games.  ， Blender embeds a python interpreter to extend its functionality.  ， Blender .blend project files can be modified to execute arbitrary  ， commands without user intervention by design. An attacker can take  ， full control of the machine where Blender is installed by sending a  ， specially crafted .blend file and enticing the user to open it.  ， 4. *Vulnerable packages*  ， . Blender 2.49b  ， . Blender 2.40  ， . Blender 2.35a  ， . Blender 2.34  ， . Older versions are probably affected too, but they were not checked.  ， 5. *Vendor Information, Solutions and Workarounds*  ， The vendor did not provide fixes or workaround information.  ， To determine if a .blend file is suspicious you could parse the  ， content of the file [3] searching for a SDNA [4] of type ScriptLink  ， [5] with python code bound to an \"onLoad\" action."
