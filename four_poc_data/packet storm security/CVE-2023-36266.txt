Note that the vendor disputes this for two reasons - the information is inherently available during a logged-in session when the attacker can read from arbitrary memory locations , and information only remains available after logout because of memory-management limitations of web browsers ( not because the Keeper technology itself is retaining the information ) .  ， cve : advisories | CVE-2023-36266  ，  ， desc :  # Exploit Title : Keeper Security desktop 16.10.2 & Browser Extension 16.5.4 - Password Dumping",
