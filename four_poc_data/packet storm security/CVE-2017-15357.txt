    "text": "title : Arq Backup 5.9.6 Local Root Privilege Escalation  ， detail : Arq Backup versions 5.9.6 and below suffer from a local root privilege escalation vulnerability.  ， cve : advisories | CVE-2017-15357  ，  ， desc : Arq Backup from Haystack Software is a great application for backing up macs and  ， windows machines. Unfortunately versions of Arq for mac before 5.9.7 are  ， vulnerable to a local root privilege escalation exploit.  ， The updater binary has a \"setpermissions\" function which sets the suid bit and  ， root ownership on itself but it suffers from a race condition that allows you to  ， swap the destination for these privileges using a symlink.  ， We can exploit this to get +s and root ownership on any arbitrary binary.  ， Other binaries in the application also suffer from the same issue.  ， This was fixed in Arq 5.9.7.  ， https : /m4.rkw.io/arq_5.9.6.sh.txt  ， 49cc82df33a3e23245c7a1659cc74c0e554d5fdbe2547ac14e838338e823956d",
