    "text": "title : PHP-FPM 7.x Remote Code Execution  ， detail : This Metasploit module exploits an underflow vulnerability in PHP-FPM versions 7.1.x below 7.1.33 , 7.2.x below 7.2.24 and 7.3.x below 7.3.11 of PHP-FPM on Nginx. Only servers with certain Nginx + PHP-FPM configurations are exploitable. This is a port of the original neex's exploit code ( see refs ) . First , it detects the correct parameters ( Query String Length and custom header length ) needed to trigger code execution. This step determines if the target is actually vulnerable ( Check method ) . Then , the exploit sets a series of PHP INI directives to create a file locally on the target , which enables code execution through a query string parameter. This is used to execute normal payload stagers. Finally , this module does some cleanup by killing local PHP-FPM workers ( those are spawned automatically once killed ) and removing the created local file.  ， cve : advisories | CVE-2019-11043  ，  ， desc :  #   ，  # This module requires Metasploit : https : /metasploit.com/download  ，  # Current source : https : /github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework",
