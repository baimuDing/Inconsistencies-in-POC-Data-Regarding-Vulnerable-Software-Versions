    "text": "title : Apache Commons Text 1.9 Remote Code Execution  ， detail : This Metasploit module exploit takes advantage of the StringSubstitutor interpolator class , which is included in the Commons Text library. A default interpolator allows for string lookups that can lead to remote code execution. This is due to a logic flaw that makes the script , dns and url lookup keys interpolated by default , as opposed to what it should be , according to the documentation of the StringLookupFactory class. Those keys allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code via lookups primarily using the script key. In order to exploit the vulnerabilities , the following requirements must be met : Run a version of Apache Commons Text from version 1.5 to 1.9 , use the StringSubstitutor interpolator , and the target should run JDK versions prior to 15.  ， cve : advisories | CVE-2022-42889  ，  ， desc :  #   ，  # This module requires Metasploit : https : /metasploit.com/download  ，  # Current source : https : /github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework  ，   ， 'Description' => %q{  ， This exploit takes advantage of the StringSubstitutor interpolator class ,   ， which is included in the Commons Text library.
