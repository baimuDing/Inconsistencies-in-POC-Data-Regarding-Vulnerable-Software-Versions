Due to a flaw in AfdNotifyRemoveIoCompletion , it is possible to create an arbitrary kernel Write-Where primitive , which can be used to manipulate internal I/O ring structures and achieve local privilege escalation. This exploit only supports Windows 11 22H2 up to build 22621.963 ( patched in January 2023 updates ) .  ， cve : advisories | CVE-2023-21768  ，  ， desc :  #   ，  # This module requires Metasploit : https : /metasploit.com/download  ，  # Current source : https : /github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework  ，   ， 'Description' => %q{  ， A vulnerability exists in the Windows Ancillary Function Driver for Winsock  ，  ( `afd.sys` ) can be leveraged by an attacker to escalate privileges to those of  ， NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM.
