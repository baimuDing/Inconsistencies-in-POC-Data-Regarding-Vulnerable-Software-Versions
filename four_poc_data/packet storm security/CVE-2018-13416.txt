    "text": "title : Universal Media Server 7.1.0 XML Injection  ， detail : Universal Media Server version 7.1.0 suffers from an XML external entity injection vulnerability in SSDP processing.  ， cve : advisories | CVE-2018-13416  ，  ， desc : Issue : Out-of-Band XE in Universal Media Server's SSDP Processing  ， Reserved CVE : CVE-2018-13416  ，  # Vulnerability Overview  ， The XML parsing engine for Universal Media Server's SSDP/UPNP functionality is vulnerable to an XML External Entity Processing ( XE ) attack. Unauthenticated attackers on the same LAN can use this vulnerability to :   ， - Access arbitrary files from the filesystem with the same permission as the user account running UMS.  ， - Initiate SMB connections to capture NetNTLM challenge/response and crack to clear-text password.  ， - Initiate SMB connections to relay NetNTLM challenge/response and achieve Remote Command Execution in Windows domains.  ， Exploitation can be demonstrated using evil-ssdp ( https : /gitlab.com/initstring/evil-ssdp ) .  ，  # Discovered By  ， Chris Moberly @ The Missing Link Security  ，  # Vendor Status  ， UMS team responded to notification within an hour , patch in progress.  ，  # Vulnerability Details  ， Atack type : Remote , unauthenticated  ， Impact : Information disclosure up to code execution  ， Affected component : UMS's SSDP discovery / XML parsing  ， Operating Systems affected : Verified Windows 10 ( likely all versions )   ， UMS version affected : Tested on 7.1.0 ( current as of July 2018 ) . Older versions likely also vulnerable.  ， Attack vector : XE  ，  # Technical Overview  ， UMS , like many other media servers , will attempt to discover other devices on a local network. The discovery process is handled by Simple Service Discovery Protocol ( SSDP )  , which sends a UDP multicast out to 239.255.255.250 on port 1900. This is the first step in finding and adding Universal Plug and Play ( UPNP ) devices.  ， We can reply to that UDP multicast directly on the same port that the request initiated from , informing this client that we have a shared device. When we do this , we provide the location of an XML file containing more information about our device. This is called a Device Descriptor.  ， UMS will automatically access the Device Descriptor over HTTP , parsing the XML content. This is expected behaviour for SSDP/UPNP.  ， By hosting a specially crafted XML file at that location , we can force UMS to do several things. The POC used to prove this vulnerability ( POC 1 below ) contained the following XML content :   ， `",
