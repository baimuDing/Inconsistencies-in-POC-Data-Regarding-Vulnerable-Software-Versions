    "text": "title : Veritas Backup Exec Name Service Overflow  ， detail : This Metasploit module exploits a vulnerability in the Veritas Backup Exec Agent Browser service. This vulnerability occurs when a recv (  ) call has a length value too long for the destination stack buffer. By sending an agent name value of 63 bytes or more , we can overwrite the return address of the recv function. Since we only have ~ 60 bytes of contiguous space for shellcode , a tiny findsock payload is sent which uses a hardcoded IAT address for the recv (  ) function. This payload will then roll the stack back to the beginning of the page , recv (  ) the real shellcode into it , and jump to it. This Metasploit module has been tested against Veritas 9.1 SP0 , 9.1 SP1 , and 8.6.  ， cve : advisories | CVE-2004-1172  ，  ， desc :  #   ，  #  $ Id $   ，   ，  # This file is part of the Metasploit Framework and may be subject to  ，  # redistribution and commercial restrictions.
