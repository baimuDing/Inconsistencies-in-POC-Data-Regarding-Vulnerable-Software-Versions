    "text": "title : CyberArk Credential Provider Race Condition / Authorization Bypass  ， detail : CyberArk's Credential Provider loopback communications on TCP port 18923 are encrypted with key material that has extremely low entropy. In all currently-known use cases , the effective key space is less than 2^16. For an attacker who understands the key derivation scheme and encryption mechanics , knowledge of the source port and access to the payloads of a given client-server exchange are sufficient to reduce effective key space to one. In cases where the source port is not known , the encrypted payloads will be unable to withstand a brute force attack. Additionally , the user identification mechanism used by CyberArk's Credential Provider is vulnerable to a race condition where an unauthorized/unprivileged user can submit one or more encrypted query requests. If the race is won , the attacker will be able to retrieve sensitive information including passwords and password metadata.
