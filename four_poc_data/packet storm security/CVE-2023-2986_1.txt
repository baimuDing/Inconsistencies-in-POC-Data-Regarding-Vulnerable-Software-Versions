    "text": "title : WordPress Abandoned Cart Lite For WooCommerce 5.14.2 Authentication Bypass  ， detail : WordPress Abandoned Cart Lite for WooCommerce plugin versions 5.14.2 and below suffer from an authentication bypass vulnerability.  ， cve : advisories | CVE-2023-2986  ，  ， desc : On May 29 , 2023 , our Wordfence Threat Intelligence team identified and began the responsible disclosure process for an Authentication Bypass vulnerability in Tyche Softwaress Abandoned Cart Lite for WooCommerce plugin , which is actively installed on more than 30 , 000 WordPress websites. This vulnerability makes it possible for an attacker to gain access to the accounts of users who have abandoned their carts , who are typically customers but can extend to other high-level users when the right conditions are met.  ， Wordfence Premium , Wordfence Care , and Wordfence Response users received a firewall rule to protect against any exploits targeting this vulnerability on June 7 , 2023. Sites still using the free version of Wordfence will receive the same protection on July 7 , 2023.  ， We contacted Tyche Softwares on May 30 , 2023 , and received a response the next day. After providing full disclosure details , the developer released a patch on June 6 , 2023. We would like to commend the Tyche Softwares development team for their prompt response and timely patch.  ， We urge users to update their sites with the latest patched version of Abandoned Cart Lite for WooCommerce , version 5.15.1 at the time of this writing , as soon as possible.  ， Vulnerability Summary from Wordfence Intelligence  ， Description : Abandoned Cart Lite for WooCommerce <= 5.14.2 Authentication Bypass  ， Affected Plugin : Abandoned Cart Lite for WooCommerce  ， Plugin Slug : woocommerce-abandoned-cart  ， Affected Versions : <= 5.14.2  ， CVE ID : CVE-2023-2986  ， CVSS Score : 9.8 ( Critical )   ， CVSS Vector : CVSS : 3.1/AV : N/AC : L/PR : N/UI : N/S : U/C : H/I : H/A : H  ， Researcher/s : Lana Codes  ， Fully Patched Version : 5.15.1  ， The Abandoned Cart Lite for WooCommerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authentication bypass in versions up to , and including , 5.14.2. This is due to insufficient encryption on the user being supplied during the abandoned cart link decode through the plugin. This allows unauthenticated attackers to log in as users who have abandoned the cart , who are typically customers.  ， Technical Analysis  ， The Abandoned Cart Lite for WooCommerce plugin , according to its settings , sends a notification to customers who have not completed the purchase process , who have , in other words , abandoned their cart. The notification contains a link that automatically logs in the customer to continue their purchase. Examining the code reveals that the link contains an encrypted value , which identifies the abandoned cart.  ，  [ View this code snippet on the blog ]   ， The link only works if it contains the properly encrypted value , which requires the encryption key to create. However , we found that the encryption key is hardcoded in the plugin , which means that threat actors also have access to it. Due to this , it is possible to create a link using the key that includes the abandoned cart identifier of other users , since each cart identifier is a sequentially increasing number starting from one.  ，  [ View this code snippet on the blog ]   ， An attacker is limited to what users they can log in as due to the fact that it is only possible to login as a user with an abandoned cart. Considering the requirement of an abandoned cart , in most cases an attacker will only be able to log in as a customer-level user. However , there is a chance that by exploiting the authentication bypass vulnerability , an attacker can gain access to an administrative user account , or another higher-level user account if they have been testing the abandoned cart functionality. Regardless , this is a severe vulnerability that can lead to customer sensitive information being exposed at its best and complete compromise of a site at its worst.  ， Update Notice and Recommendation  ， We would also like to make a note that the developers made the functionality backward compatible in version 5.15.0 , which means that old abandoned carts can be exploited even if the plugin is updated to that version. Further security hardening was introduced in version 5.15.1 that ensures sites are no longer vulnerable through old abandoned cart links , therefore , we recommend making sure all sites are updated to that version.",
