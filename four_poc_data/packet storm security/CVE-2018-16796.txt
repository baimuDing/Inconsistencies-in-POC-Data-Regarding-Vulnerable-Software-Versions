    "text": "title : HiScout GRC Suite File Upload  ， detail : HiScout GRC Suite versions prior to 3.1.5 suffer from a file upload vulnerability. An authenticated attacker with the permission to edit or add a \"WebSiteElement\" to the \"content\" pages is able to upload any file with any file extension to the data directory of the application. This directory is in the web root and the uploaded file is executed on the server if \".aspx\" is chosen as the file extension and if the file contains aspx source code. Any commands can be executed with the permissions of the web server user on the server by exploiting this vulnerability.  ， cve : advisories | CVE-2018-16796  ，  ， desc : -BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-  ， Hash : SHA512  ， Advisory ID : SYSS-2018-015  ， Product : HiScout GRC Suite  ， Manufacturer : HiScout GmbH  ， Affected Version ( s )  : < 3.1.5  ， Tested Version ( s )  : 3.1.3.12  ， Vulnerability Type : Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type  ， Risk Level : High  ， Solution Status : Fixed  ， Manufacturer Notification : 2018-07-26  ， Solution Date : 2018-09-03  ， Public Disclosure : 2018-09-12  ， CVE Reference : CVE-2018-16796  ， Author of Advisory : Sebastian Auwaerter , SySS GmbH  ，  ， Overview :   ， HiScout GRC Suite is a platform for managing IT governance , risk and  ， compliance.  ， The manufacturer describes the various modules of the  ， product as follows ( see [ 1 ]  )  :   ， The HiScout ISM module is geared toward meeting the requirements of the  ， ISO 27000 series of international standards , and provides a reliable  ， basis for the information management systems control loop.  ， The HiScout Grundschutz module fully supports operations toward BSI  ， standard 100-2.
