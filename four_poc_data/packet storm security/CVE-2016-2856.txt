    "text": "title : Ubuntu PT Chown Privilege Escalation  ， detail : Ubuntu versions prior to 15.10 suffer from a PT chown arbitrary PTs access via user namespace privilege escalation vulnerability.  ， cve : advisories | CVE-2016-2856  ，  ， desc : Source : http : /www.halfdog.net/Security/2015/PtChownArbitraryPtsAccessViaUserNamespace/  ，   ，  # Introduction  ，   ， Problem description : With Ubuntu Wily and earlier , /usr/lib/pt_chown was used to change ownership of slave pts devices in /dev/pts to the same uid holding the master file descriptor for the slave. This is done using the pt_chown SUID binary , which invokes the ptsname function on the master-fd , thus again performing a TIOCGPTN ioctl to get the slave pts number. Using the result from the ioctl , the pathname of the slave pts is constructed and chown invoked on it , see login/programs/pt_chown.c :   ，   ， pty = ptsname ( PTY_FILENO )  ;   ，  ， .  ， / * Get the group ID of the special `tty' group. * /  ， p = getgrnam ( TTY_GROUP )  ;   ， gid = p ? p->gr_gid : getgid (  )  ;   ，   ， / * Set the owner to the real user ID , and the group to that special  ， group ID. * /  ，   ，   ， / * Set the permission mode to readable and writable by the owner ,   ， and writable by the group. * /  ，  ， & chmod ( pty , S_IRUSR | S_IWUSR | S_IWGRP ) < 0 )   ，   ，   ，   ， The logic above is severely flawed , when there can be more than one master/slave pair having the same number and thus same name. But this condition can be easily created by creating an user namespace , mounting devpts with the newinstance option , create master and slave pts pairs until the number overlaps with a target pts outside the namespace on the host , where there is interest to gain ownership and then  ，   ，  # Methods  ，   ， Exploitation is trivial : At first use any user namespace demo to create the namespace needed , e.g. UserNamespaceExec.c ( http : /www.halfdog.net/Misc/Utils/UserNamespaceExec.c ) and work with standard shell commands , e.g. to take over /dev/pts/0 :   ，   ， test # who am I  ， test pts/1 2015-12-27 12 : 00",
