The socket layer uses several logical sublayers.  ， One of the layers , so called auxiliary message layer ( or scm layer )  ,   ， augments the socket API by an universal user-kernel message passing  ， capability ( see recvfrom ( 2 ) for more details on auxiliary messages ) .  ， One of the scm message parsing functions invoked from the kernel  ， sendmsg (  ) code is _scm_send (  ) and suffers from a deadlock condition if  ， carefully prepared auxiliary message ( s ) is sent to a socket by an  ， unprivileged application.  ， We believe that the 2.4 kernel branch is not further exploitable. The  ， 2.6 branch has not been extensively checked , however it may be locally  ， exploitable to gain elevated privileges due to its increased complexity.  ， Discussion :   ，  ， See attached code.  ， Impact :   ，  ， Unprivileged local users may hang a vulnerable Linux machine.",
