Tested against latest patchset (7100-04)  ，  ， # This exploit takes advantage of known issues with debugging functions  ， # within the AIX linker library. We are taking advantage of known  ， # functionality, and focusing on badly coded SUID binaries which do not  ， # adhere to proper security checks prior to seteuid/open/writes.  ，  ， # The CVEs we will be taking advantage of:  ， # - CVE-2009-1786: The malloc subsystem in libc in IBM AIX 5.3 and 6.1 allows  ， # local users to create or overwrite arbitrary files via a symlink attack on  ， # the log file associated with the MALLOCDEBUG environment variable.  ，  ， # - CVE-2009-2669: A certain debugging component in IBM AIX 5.3 and 6.1 does  ， # not properly handle the (1) _LIB_INIT_DBG and (2) _LIB_INIT_DBG_FILE  ， # environment variables, which allows local users to gain privileges by  ， # leveraging a setuid-root program to create an arbitrary root-owned file  ， # with world-writable permissions, related to libC.a (aka the XL C+ runtime  ， # library) in AIX 5.3 and libc.a in AIX 6.1.  ，  ， # - CVE-2014-3074: Runtime Linker Allows Privilege Escalation Via Arbitrary  ， # File Writes In IBM AIX.  ，  ， # In each instance of the aforementioned CVEs, IBM merely patched the binaries  ， # which were reported in the original reports as being used for escalation of  ， # the vulnerabilities. This allowed for the lquerylv binary to slip by their  ， # patches and become an attack vector.  ，  ， # Blog post URL: https:/rhinosecuritylabs.com/2016/11/03/unix-nostalgia-hunting-zeroday-vulnerabilities-ibm-aix/  ，  ， # lqueryroot.sh by @hxmonsegur [2016 /RSL]"
