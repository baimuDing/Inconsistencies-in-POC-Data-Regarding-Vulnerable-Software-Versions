    "text": "title : Mac OS X TimeMachine ( tmdiagnose ) Command Injection Privilege Escalation  ， detail : This Metasploit module exploits a command injection in TimeMachine on macOS <= 10.14.3 in order to run a payload as root. The tmdiagnose binary on OSX <= 10.14.3 suffers from a command injection vulnerability that can be exploited by creating a specially crafted disk label. The tmdiagnose binary uses awk to list every mounted volume , and composes shell commands based on the volume labels. By creating a volume label with the backtick character , we can have our own binary executed with root privileges.  ， cve : advisories | CVE-2019-8513  ，  ， desc :  #   ，  # This module requires Metasploit : https : /metasploit.com/download  ，  # Current source : https : /github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework",
