    "text": "title : TP-LINK Cloud Cameras NCX Hardcoded Encryption Key  ， detail : TP-LINK Cloud Cameras including products NC200 , NC210 , NC220 , NC230 , NC250 , NC260 , and NC450 suffer from having a hardcoded encryption key. The issue is located in the methods swSystemBackup and sym.swSystemRestoreFile , where a hardcoded encryption key is used in order to encrypt/decrypt a config backup file. The algorithm in use is DES ECB with modified s-boxes and permutation tables.  ， cve : advisories | CVE-2020-12110  ，  ， desc : Vulnerability title : TP-LINK Cloud Cameras NCX Hardcoded Encryption Key  ， Author : Pietro Oliva  ， CVE : CVE-2020-12110  ， Vendor : TP-LINK  ， Product : NC200 , NC210 , NC220 , NC230 , NC250 , NC260 , NC450  ， Affected version : NC200 <= 2.1.9 build 200225 , NC210 <= 1.0.9 build 200304 ,   ， NC220 <= 1.3.0 build 200304 , NC230 <= 1.3.0 build 200304 ,   ， NC250 <= 1.3.0 build 200304 , NC260 <= 1.5.2 build 200304 ,   ， NC450 <= 1.5.3 build 200304.  ， Fixed version : NC200 <= 2.1.10 build 200401 , NC210 <= 1.0.10 build 200401 ,   ， NC220 <= 1.3.1 build 200401 , NC230 <= 1.3.1 build 200401 ,   ， NC250 <= 1.3.1 build 200401 , NC260 <= 1.5.3 build_200401 ,   ， NC450 <= 1.5.4 build 200401  ， Description :   ， The issue is located in the methods swSystemBackup and sym.swSystemRestoreFile ,   ， where a hardcoded encryption key is used in order to encrypt/decrypt a config  ， backup file. The algorithm in use is DES ECB with modified s-boxes and  ， permutation tables.  ， Impact :   ， Attackers could exploit this vulnerability to decrypt backup files and get  ， access to sensitive data , such as the following :   ， -Alarm FTP server user and password  ， -Wlan passphrase  ， -PPPOE user and password  ， -Alarm SMTP server user and password  ， -DDNS user and password  ， In addition to that , attackers could forge an encrypted backup file that can  ， be restored via the web interface. This allowed arbitrary files to be written or  ， overwritten with arbitrary attacker-controlled contents. Needless to say , this  ， could result in permanent damage or code execution as root.  ， Exploitation :   ， An attacker would have to figure out the modified DES algorithm in order to be  ， able to encrypt/decrypt config backup files. This is not hard to do with some  ， google search. Once that has been done , attackers can either decrypt backup  ， files or create their own with custom contents , effectlively writing arbitrary  ， files on the device.  ， Evidence :   ， The disassembly of affected code from an NC200 camera is shown below : ",
