CDF versions 3.2 and earlier are vulnerable.  ， cve : advisories | CVE-2008-2080  ，  ， desc : -BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-  ， Hash : SHA1  ， Core Security Technologies - CoreLabs Advisory  ， http : /www.coresecurity.com/corelabs/  ， NASA's Common Data Format buffer overflow  ，  * Advisory Information *   ， Title : NASA's Common Data Format buffer overflow  ， Advisory ID : CORE-2008-0326  ， Advisory URL : http : /www.coresecurity.com/?action=item&id=2260  ， Date published : 2008-05-05  ， Date of last update : 2008-05-05  ， Vendors contacted : GODDARD Space Flight Center  ， Release mode : Coordinated release  ，  * Vulnerability Information *   ， Class : Stack Overflow  ， Remotely Exploitable : Yes  ， Locally Exploitable : No  ， Bugtraq ID : 29045  ， CVE Name : CVE-2008-2080  ，  * Vulnerability Description *   ， CDF [ 1 ] is a common data format developed by the NASA Goddard Space  ， Flight Center. It is a conceptual data abstraction for storing ,   ， manipulating , and accessing multidimensional data sets. The CDF software  ， package is used by hundreds of government agencies , universities , and  ， private and commercial organizations as well as independent researchers  ， on both national and international levels.  ， The CDF Library is vulnerable to a buffer overflow in the stack , which  ， can be exploited by malicious remote attackers to compromise a user's  ， system. The vulnerability is caused due to the CDF  ，  ( 'src/lib/cdfread64.c' ) library not properly sanitizing the length tags  ， on a CDF file before using it to copy data on a stack buffer. This can  ， be exploited to get arbitrary code execution by opening a specially  ， crafted file.  ，  * Vulnerable Packages *   ， . CDF 3.2 and earlier.  ，  * Non-vulnerable Packages *   ， . CDF 3.2.1  ，  * Vendor Information , Solutions and Workarounds *   ， The CDF project has issued a security advisory describing this  ， vulnerability http : /cdf.gsfc.nasa.gov/CDF32_buffer_overflow.html ,   ， partially quoted below.  ， The libraries for the scientific data file format , Common Data Format  ，  ( CDF ) http : /cdf.gsfc.nasa.gov/ version 3.2 and earlier , have the  ， potential for a buffer overflow vulnerability when reading  ， specially-crafted ( invalid ) CDF files. If successful , this could trigger  ， execution of arbitrary code within the context of the CDF-reading  ， program that could be exploited to compromise a system , or otherwise  ， crash the program. While it's unlikely that you would open CDFs from  ， untrusted sources , we recommend everyone upgrade to the latest CDF  ， libraries on their systems , including the IDL and Matlab plugins. Most  ， worrisome is any service that enables the general public to submit CDF  ， files for processing.  ， The vulnerability is in the CDF library routines not properly checking  ， the length tags on a CDF file before copying data to a stack buffer.  ， Exploitation requires the user to explicitly open a specially-crafted  ， file. CDF users should not open files from untrusted third parties until  ， the patch is applied ( and continue then to exercise normal caution for  ， files from untrusted third parties ) .  ， CDF 3.2.1 addresses this vulnerability and introduces further usability  ， fixes http : /cdf.gsfc.nasa.gov/. Updates for Perl , IDL , Matlab and Java  ， WebStart are also available. Java WebStart applications that refer to  ， http : /sscweb.gsfc.nasa.gov/skteditor/cdf/cdf-latest.jnlp , will  ， automatically be updated to include this fix the next time the  ， application is started while connected to the Internet.",
