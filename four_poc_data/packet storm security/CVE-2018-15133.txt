    "text": "title : PHP Laravel Framework Token Unserialize Remote Command Execution  ， detail : This Metasploit module exploits a vulnerability in the PHP Laravel Framework for versions 5.5.40 , 5.6.x up to 5.6.29. Remote command execution is possible via a correctly formatted HTTP X-XSRF-TOKEN header , due to an insecure unserialize call of the decrypt method in Illuminate/Encryption/Encrypter.php. Authentication is not required , however exploitation requires knowledge of the Laravel APP_KEY. Similar vulnerabilities appear to exist within Laravel cookie tokens based on the code fix. In some cases the APP_KEY is leaked which allows for discovery and exploitation.  ， cve : advisories | CVE-2017-16894 , CVE-2018-15133  ，  ， desc :  #   ，  # This module requires Metasploit : https : /metasploit.com/download  ，  # Current source : https : /github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework  ，   ， 'Description' => %q{  ， This module exploits a vulnerability in the PHP Laravel Framework for versions 5.5.40 , 5.6.x <= 5.6.29.  ， Remote Command Execution is possible via a correctly formatted HTTP X-XSRF-TOKEN header , due to  ， an insecure unserialize call of the decrypt method in Illuminate/Encryption/Encrypter.php.  ， Authentication is not required , however exploitation requires knowledge of the Laravel APP_KEY.  ， Similar vulnerabilities appear to exist within Laravel cookie tokens based on the code fix.  ， In some cases the APP_KEY is leaked which allows for discovery and exploitation.  ， }",
