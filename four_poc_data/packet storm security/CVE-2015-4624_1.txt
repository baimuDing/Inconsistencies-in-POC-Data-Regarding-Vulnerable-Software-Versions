    "text": "title : Hak5 WiFi Pineapple Preconfiguration Command Injection 2  ， detail : This Metasploit module exploits a command injection vulnerability on WiFi Pineapples versions 2.0 and below and pineapple versions prior to 2.4. We use a combination of default credentials with a weakness in the anti-csrf generation to achieve command injection on fresh pineapple devices prior to configuration. Additionally if default credentials fail , you can enable a brute force solver for the proof-of-ownership challenge. This will reset the password to a known password if successful and may interrupt the user experience. These devices may typically be identified by their SSID beacons of 'Pineapple5_.' ; details derived from the TospoVirus , a WiFi Pineapple infecting worm.  ， cve : advisories | CVE-2015-4624  ，  ， desc :  #   ，  # This module requires Metasploit : http : /metasploit.com/download  ，  # Current source : https : /github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework  ，  ， require 'msf/core'",
