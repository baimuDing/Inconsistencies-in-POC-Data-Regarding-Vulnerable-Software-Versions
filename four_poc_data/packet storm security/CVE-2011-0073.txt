    "text": "title : Mozilla Firefox \"nsTreeRange\" Dangling Pointer Vulnerability  ， detail : This Metasploit module exploits a code execution vulnerability in Mozilla Firefox 3.6.x <= 3.6.16 and 3.5.x <= 3.5.17 found in nsTreeSelection. By overwriting a subfunction of invalidateSelection it is possible to free the nsTreeRange object that the function currently operates on. Any further operations on the freed object can result in remote code execution. Utilizing the call setup the function provides it's possible to bypass DEP without the need for a ROP. Sadly this exploit is still either dependent on Java or bound by ASLR because Firefox doesn't employ any ASLR-free modules anymore.  ， cve : advisories | CVE-2011-0073 , OSVDB-72087  ，  ， desc :  #   ，  #  $ Id : mozilla_nstreerange.rb 13148 2011-07-10 21 : 10 : 45Z sinn3r $   ，   ，  # This file is part of the Metasploit Framework and may be subject to  ，  # redistribution and commercial restrictions.
