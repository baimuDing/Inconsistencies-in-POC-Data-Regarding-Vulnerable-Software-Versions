Why? Well.there's a lot of kiddies out there ,   ，  * if you know how to program , making a loop or using with other tool is piece of cake. There core idea is there , just use it as you please.  ，  ， / * MODIFICATION * /  ，  ，  * ntpd 'get monlist' ddos amplification cve-2013-5211 exploit Todor Donev ( todor.donev @ gmail.com )   ，  ，  * A Network Time Protocol ( NTP ) Amplification attack is an emerging form of Distributed Denial of Service ( DDoS )   ，  * that relies on the use of publically accessible NTP servers to overwhelm a victim system with UDP traffic.  ，  ，  * The attack relies on the exploitation of the 'monlist' feature of NTP , as described in CVE-2013-5211 , which is  ，  * enabled by default on older NTP-capable devices. This command causes a list of the last 600 IP addresses which  ，  * connected to the NTP server to be sent to the victim. Due to the spoofed source address , when the NTP server  ，  * sends the response it is sent instead to the victim. Because the size of the response is typically considerably  ，  * larger than the request , the attacker is able to amplify the volume of traffic directed at the victim.  ，  * Additionally , because the responses are legitimate data coming from valid servers , it is especially difficult  ，  * to block these types of attacks. The solution is to disable monlist within the NTP server or to upgrade to  ，  * the latest version of NTP ( 4.2.7 ) which disables the monlist functionality.  ，  ，  * PoC generate and send 1 spoofed packet and don't do enough to Distributed Denial of Service.I'm made loop for  ，  * sending multiple packets. Now this exploit is very dangerous against unpatched NTP servers. They can respond  ，  * back to spoofed IP address ( victim ) . The size of the response is typically considerably larger than the request.  ，  ，  * use at your own risk | use at your own risk | use at your own risk | use at your own risk | use at your own risk",
