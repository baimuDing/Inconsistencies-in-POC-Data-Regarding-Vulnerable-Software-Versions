This  ， could allow an arbitrary web site to be spoofed.  ， After discussions with the vendor , CVE-2011-1168 was assigned to this  ， vulnerability.  ， Technical Details  ， Konqueror 4.4.x , 4.5.x and 4.6.x are affected by HTML injection which allows  ， an arbitrary URL to be spoofed. Opening a fresh instance of Konqueror and  ， entering the following URL causes the error page HTML to become corrupted :   ， http : /thisdomainwillnotresolveandrekonqerrorpagewillbeshownwithfullurlembedded.twitter.com/\"><h1>Test</h1>  ， Since Konqueror fails to resolve the hostname it will then will display an  ， error message containing the requested URL including the HTML tags.  ， It is worth noting that Javascript execution does not appear to be possible  ， in the context of the unresolvable hostname for two reasons. Firstly  ， Konqueror disables Javascript within KHTMLPart : htmlError (  )  ( between the  ， calls to begin (  ) and end (  ) and secondly because the code executes in an  ， empty domain preventing the cookies for the spoofed URL from being accessed.  ， Whilst the first of these restrictions could be bypassed in a number of  ， ways ( see below )  , no method has currently been identified to bypass the  ， latter to break Konqueror's same origin policy.  ， It was identified that the first restriction could be bypassed at least two  ， ways. Firstly a link can be injected with a URL in the form javascript : .  ， and secondly an iframe can be injected with a source URL in the form",
