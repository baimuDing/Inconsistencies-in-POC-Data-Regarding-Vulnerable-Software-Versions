    "text": "title : RARLAB WinRAR ACE Format Input Validation Remote Code Execution  ， detail : In WinRAR versions prior to and including 5.61 , there is path traversal vulnerability when crafting the filename field of the ACE format ( in UNACEV2.dll ) . When the filename field is manipulated with specific patterns , the destination ( extraction ) folder is ignored , thus treating the filename as an absolute path. This module will attempt to extract a payload to the startup folder of the current user. It is limited such that we can only go back one folder. Therefore , for this exploit to work properly , the user must extract the supplied RAR file from one folder within the user profile folder ( e.g. Desktop or Downloads ) . User restart is required to gain a shell.  ， cve : advisories | CVE-2018-20250  ，  ， desc :  #   ，  # This module requires Metasploit : https : /metasploit.com/download  ，  # Current source : https : /github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework  ，   ，  # TODO : add other non-payload files",
