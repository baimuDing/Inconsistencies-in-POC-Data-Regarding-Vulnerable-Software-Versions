    "text": "title : VLC MMS Stream Handling Buffer Overflow  ， detail : This Metasploit module exploits a buffer overflow in VLC media player VLC media player prior to 2.0.0. The vulnerability is due to a dangerous use of sprintf which can result in a stack buffer overflow when handling a malicious MMS URI. This Metasploit module uses the browser as attack vector. A specially crafted MMS URI is used to trigger the overflow and get flow control through SEH overwrite. Control is transferred to code located in the heap through a standard heap spray. The module only targets IE6 and IE7 because no DEP/ASLR bypass has been provided.  ， cve : advisories | CVE-2012-1775 , OSVDB-80188  ，  ， desc :  #   ，  # This file is part of the Metasploit Framework and may be subject to  ，  # redistribution and commercial restrictions.
