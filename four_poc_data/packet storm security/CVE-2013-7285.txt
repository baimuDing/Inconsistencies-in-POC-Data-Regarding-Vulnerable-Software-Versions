Hysell  ， Product description :   ， OpenMRS is \"the world's leading open source enterprise electronic  ， medical record system platform.\"  ， Vulnerability summary :   ， The OpenMRS Reporting Module 0.9.7 passes untrusted XML input to a  ， version of the XStream library vulnerable to CVE-2013-7285 , making it  ， vulnerable to remote code execution. If the Appointment Scheduling UI  ， Module 1.0.3 is also installed , this RCE is accessible to  ， unauthenticated attackers. OpenMRS Standalone 2.3 and OpenMRS Platform  ， 1.11.4 WAR with Reporting 0.9.7 and Appointment Scheduling UI 1.0.3  ， installed were confirmed to be vulnerable ; other versions and  ， configurations containing these modules are likely to be vulnerable as  ， well ( see \"Remediation\" ) .  ， Details :   ， In the Reporting module , the method saveSerializedDefinition ( mapped  ， to module/reporting/definition/saveSerializedDefinition ) in  ， InvalidSerializedDefinitionController can be accessed by an  ， unauthenticated user.  ， The attacker must provide a valid UUID for a definition present in  ， OpenMRS or a NullPointerException will be thrown before the remote  ， code execution can take place. However , upon initialization the  ， Appointments Scheduling UI module inserts a definition with a constant  ， UUID hard-coded into AppointmentSchedulingUIConstants  ，  ( c1bf0730-e69e-11e3-ac10-0800200c9a66 ) .",
