    "text": "title : AF_PACKET chocobo_root Privilege Escalation  ， detail : This Metasploit module exploits a race condition and use-after-free in the packet_set_ring function in net/packet/af_packet.c ( AF_PACKET ) in the Linux kernel to execute code as root ( CVE-2016-8655 ) . The bug was initially introduced in 2011 and patched in 2016 in version 4.4.0-53.74 , potentially affecting a large number of kernels ; however this exploit targets only systems using Ubuntu ( Trusty / Xenial ) kernels 4.4.0 < 4.4.0-53 , including Linux distros based on Ubuntu , such as Linux Mint. The target system must have unprivileged user namespaces enabled and two or more CPU cores. Bypasses for SMEP , SMAP and KASLR are included. Failed exploitation may crash the kernel. This Metasploit module has been tested successfully on Linux Mint 17.3 ( x86_64 )  ; Linux Mint 18 ( x86_64 )  ; and Ubuntu 16.04.2 ( x86_64 ) with kernel versions 4.4.0-45-generic and 4.4.0-51-generic.  ， cve : advisories | CVE-2016-8655  ，  ， desc :  #   ，  # This module requires Metasploit : https : /metasploit.com/download  ，  # Current source : https : /github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework",
