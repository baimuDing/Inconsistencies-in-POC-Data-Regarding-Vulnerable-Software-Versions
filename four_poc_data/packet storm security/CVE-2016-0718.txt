It protects  ， against malware and spyware and shields end users from fake websites phishing  ，  ， Unauthorized devices can be blocked from the system entirely. The solution's  ， highly intuitive interface allows for quick navigation.\"  ， Vulnerable versions of ESET Endpoint Antivirus 6 are statically linked with an  ， outdated XML parsing library and do not perform proper server authentication,  ， allowing for remote unauthenticated attackers to perform arbitrary code  ， execution as root on vulnerable clients.  ， Vulnerability  ，  ， The esets_daemon service, which runs as root, is statically linked with an  ， outdated version of the POCO XML parser library (https:/pocoproject.org/) -  ， version 1.4.6p1 from 2013-03-06. This version of POCO is based on Expat  ， (http:/expat.sourceforge.net/) version 2.0.1 from 2007-06-05, which has a  ， publicly known XML parsing vulnerability (CVE-2016-0718) that allows for  ， arbitrary code execution via malformed XML content.  ， When ESET Endpoint Antivirus tries to activate its license, esets_daemon sends a  ， request to https:/edf.eset.com/edf. The esets_daemon service does not validate  ， the web server's certificate, so a man-in-the-middle can intercept the request  ， and respond using a self-signed HTTPS certificate. The esets_daemon service  ， parses the response as an XML document, thereby allowing the attacker to supply  ， malformed content and exploit CVE-2016-0718 to achieve arbitrary code execution  ， as root.  ， Proof of Concept  ，  ， Extract overflow.xml from https:/bugzilla.suse.com/attachment.cgi?id=676490  ， (ZIP file containing a public proof-of-concept for CVE-2016-0718) and run the  ， following Python program:  ， _"
