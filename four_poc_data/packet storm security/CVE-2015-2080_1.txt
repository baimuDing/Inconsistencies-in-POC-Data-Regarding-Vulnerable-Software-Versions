When the Jetty web server receives a HTTP request , the below code is used to parse through the HTTP headers and their associated values. Inductive Automation versions 7.8.1 ( b2016012216 ) and 7.8.0 ( b2015101414 ) are affected.  ， cve : advisories | CVE-2015-2080  ，  ， desc : Inductive Automation Ignition 7.8.1 Remote Leakage Of Shared Buffers  ， Vendor : Inductive Automation  ， Product web page : http : /www.inductiveautomation.com  ， Affected version : 7.8.1 ( b2016012216 ) and 7.8.0 ( b2015101414 )   ， Platform : Java  ， Summary : Ignition is a powerful industrial application platform with  ， fully integrated development tools for building SCADA , MES , and IIoT  ， solutions.  ， Desc : Remote unauthenticated atackers are able to read arbitrary data  ， from other HTTP sessions because Ignition uses a vulnerable Jetty server.  ， When the Jetty web server receives a HTTP request , the below code is used  ， to parse through the HTTP headers and their associated values.
