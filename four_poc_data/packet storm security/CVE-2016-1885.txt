    "text": "title : FreeBSD Kernel amd64_set_ldt Heap Overflow  ， detail : Core Security Technologies Advisory - An integer signedness error has been found in the amd64_set_ldt (  ) function in the FreeBSD kernel code ( define d in the /sys/amd64/amd64/sys_machdep.c file )  , which implements the i386_set_ldt system call on the amd64 version of the OS. This integer signedness issue ultimately leads to a heap overflow in the kernel , allowing local unprivileged attackers to crash the system. FreeBSD 10.2 amd64 is affected.  ， cve : advisories | CVE-2016-1885  ，  ， desc : 1. Advisory Information  ， Title : FreeBSD Kernel amd64_set_ldt Heap Overflow  ， Advisory ID : CORE-2016-0005  ， Advisory URL : http : /www.coresecurity.com/advisories/freebsd-kernel-amd64setldt-heap-overflow  ， Date published : 2016-03-16  ， Date of last update : 2016-03-14  ， Vendors contacted : FreeBSD  ， Release mode : Coordinated release  ， 2. Vulnerability Information  ， Class : Unsigned to Signed Conversion Error [ CWE-196 ]   ， Impact : Denial of service  ， Remotely Exploitable : No  ， Locally Exploitable : Yes  ， CVE Name : CVE-2016-1885  ，   ， 3. Vulnerability Description  ， FreeBSD is an advanced computer operating system used to power modern servers , desktops and embedded platforms. A large community has continually developed it for more than thirty years. Its advanced networking , security and storage features have made FreeBSD the platform of choice for many of the busiest web sites and most pervasive embedded networking and storage devices.  ， An integer signedness error has been found in the amd64_set_ldt (  ) function in the FreeBSD kernel code ( defined in the /sys/amd64/amd64/sys_machdep.c file )  , which implements the i386_set_ldt system call on the amd64 version of the OS. This integer signedness issue ultimately leads to a heap overflow in the kernel , allowing local unprivileged attackers to crash the system.  ， 4. Vulnerable packages  ， FreeBSD 10.2 amd64.  ， Other amd64 versions may be affected too but they were no checked.  ， 5. Non-vulnerable packages  ， FreeBSD 10.2-RELENG.  ， 6. Vendor Information , Solutions and Workarounds  ， The FreeBSD team has released patches for the reported vulnerabilities. You should upgrade to FreeBSD 10.2-RELENG.",
