The out-of-bounds read issues exist because the functions in question do not validate that the chr argument passed to DriveIndex , which calculates an index :   ， inline int DriveIndex ( char chr )   ， {  ，   ，  ， } ;   ， In the VDir : MapPathA function , DriveIndex is called with a potentially untrusted value , pInName , and the return value is then passed to GetDirA : ",
