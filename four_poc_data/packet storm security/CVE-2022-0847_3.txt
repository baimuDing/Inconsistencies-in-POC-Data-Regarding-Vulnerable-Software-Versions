    "text": "title : Dirty Pipe Linux Privilege Escalation  ， detail : Proof of concept for a vulnerability in the Linux kernel existing since version 5.8 that allows overwriting data in arbitrary read-only files. This leads to privilege escalation because unprivileged processes can inject code into root processes.  ， cve : advisories | CVE-2022-0847  ，  ， desc : / * SPDX-License-Identifier : GPL-2.0 * /  ，  ，  * Copyright 2022 CM4all GmbH / IONOS SE  ，  ，  * author : Max Kellermann <max.kellermann @ ionos.com>  ，  ，  * Proof-of-concept exploit for the Dirty Pipe  ，  * vulnerability ( CVE-2022-0847 ) caused by an uninitialized  ，  * \"pipe_buffer.flags\" variable. It demonstrates how to overwrite any  ，  * file contents in the page cache , even if the file is not permitted  ，  * to be written , immutable or on a read-only mount.  ，  ，  * This exploit requires Linux 5.8 or later ; the code path was made  ，  * reachable by commit f6dd975583bd ( \"pipe : merge  ，  * anon_pipe_buf * _ops\" ) . The commit did not introduce the bug , it was  ，  * there before , it just provided an easy way to exploit it.",
