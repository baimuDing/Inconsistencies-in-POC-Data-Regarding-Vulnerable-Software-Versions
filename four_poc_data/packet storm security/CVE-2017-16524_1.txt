    "text": "title : Samsung SRN-1670D Web Viewer 1.0.0.193 Arbitrary File Read / Upload  ， detail : This Metasploit module exploits an unrestricted file upload vulnerability in Web Viewer 1.0.0.193 on Samsung SRN-1670D devices. The network_ssl_upload.php file allows remote authenticated attackers to upload and execute arbitrary PHP code via a filename with a .php extension , which is then accessed via a direct request to the file in the upload/ directory. To authenticate for this attack , one can obtain web-interface credentials in cleartext by leveraging the existing local file read vulnerability referenced by CVE-2015-8279 , which allows remote attackers to read the web interface credentials by sending a request to : cslog_export.php?path=/root/php_modules/lighttpd/sbin/userpw URI.  ， cve : advisories | CVE-2015-8279 , CVE-2017-16524  ，  ， desc :  #   ，  # This module requires Metasploit : https : /metasploit.com/download  ，  # Current source : https : /github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework  ，  ， require 'digest'",
