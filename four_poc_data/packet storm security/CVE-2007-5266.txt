Although the project is currently in a development phase and has  ， not made an official release yet , several vendors of mobile chips have  ， unveiled prototype phones built using development releases of the  ， platform at the Mobile World Congress [ 2 ] . Development using the Android  ， platform gained activity early in 2008 as a result of Google's launch of  ， the Android Development Challenge which includes $ 10 million USD in  ， awards [ 3 ] for which a Software Development Kit ( SDK ) was made available  ， in November 2007.  ， The Android Software Development Kit includes a fully functional  ， operating system , a set of core libraries , application development  ， frameworks , a virtual machine for executing application and a phone  ， emulator based on the QEMU emulator [ 4 ] . Public reports as of February  ， 27th , 2008 state that the Android SDK has been downloaded 750 , 000 times  ， since November 2007 [ 5 ] .  ， Several vulnerabilities have been found in Android's core libraries for  ， processing graphic content in some of the most used image formats ( PNG ,   ， GIF an BMP ) . While some of these vulnerabilities stem from the use of  ， outdated and vulnerable open source image processing libraries other  ， were introduced by native Android code that use them or that implements  ， new functionality.  ， Exploitation of these vulnerabilities to yield complete control of a  ， phone running the Android platform has been proved possible using the  ， emulator included in the SDK , which emulates phone running the Android  ， platform on an ARM microprocessor.  ， This advisory contains technical descriptions of these security bugs ,   ， including a proof of concept exploit to run arbitrary code , proving the  ， possibility of running code on Android stack ( over an ARM architecture )   ， via a binary exploit.  ，  * Vulnerable Packages *   ， . Android SDK m3-rc37a and earlier are vulnerable several bugs in  ， components that process GIF , PNG and BMP images ( bugs # 1 ,  # 2 and # 3 of  ， this advisory ) .  ， . Android SDK m5-rc14 is vulnerable to a security bug in the component  ， that process BMP images ( bug # 3 ) .  ，  * Non-vulnerable Packages *   ， . Android SDK m5-rc15  ，  * Vendor Information , Solutions and Workarounds *   ， Vendor statement :   ， \"The current version of the Android SDK is an early look release to the  ， open source community , provided so that developers can begin working  ， with the platform to inform and shape our development of Android toward  ， production readiness. The Open Handset Alliance welcomes input from the  ， security community throughout this process. There will be many changes  ， and updates to the platform before Android is ready for end users ,   ， including a full security review.\"",
