This is proof of concept code that triggers the kernel panic.  ， cve : advisories | CVE-2014-7822  ，  ， desc : / * -  ，  * cve-2014-7822_poc.c  ，  ，  * The implementation of certain splice_write file operations in the Linux kernel before 3.16 does not enforce a restriction on the maximum size of a single file  ，  * which allows local users to cause a denial of service ( system crash ) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted splice system call ,   ，  * as demonstrated by use of a file descriptor associated with an ext4 filesystem.",
