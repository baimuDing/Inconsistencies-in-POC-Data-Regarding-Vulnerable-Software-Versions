In some versions of PHP (e.g. before 5.4.24), this can be  ， leveraged into a LFI issue. If combined with arbitrary file upload with the  ， Squiz Matrix CMS website, this leads to remote code execution.  ， Within  ， packages/cms/page_templates/page_remote_content/page_remote_content.inc,  ， the POST parameter  ， page_remote_content_[pageid]_sq_remote_input_file_names is passed to  ， unserialize. No generic unserialization gadgets were identified within the  ， default installation, so the autoloader can be attacked instead.  ， There are multiple autoloaders that are enabled during the standard Squiz  ， Matrix execution path. Of note is one found in"
