A remote authenticated administrator can send a specially crafted HTTP POST request to vulnerable script and execute arbitrary SQL commands in applications database.  ， This vulnerability could also be exploited by a remote non-authenticated attacker via CSRF vector , since the application is prone to Cross-Site Request Forgery ( CSRF ) attacks. In order to do so an attacker should trick a logged-in administrator to visit a web page with CSRF exploit.  ， The CSRF exploit code below is based on DNS Exfiltration technique and may be used if the database of the vulnerable application is hosted on a Windows system. The exploit will send a DNS request demanding IP address for `version (  ) ` ( or any other sensitive output from the database ) subdomain of \".attacker.com\" ( a domain name , DNS server of which is controlled by the attacker )  : ",
