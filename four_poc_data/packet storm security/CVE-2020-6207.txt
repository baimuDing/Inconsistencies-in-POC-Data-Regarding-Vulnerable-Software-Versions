    "text": "title : SAP Solution Manager 7.2 Remote Command Execution  ， detail : This Metasploit module exploits the CVE-2020-6207 vulnerability within the SAP EEM servlet of SAP Solution Manager ( SolMan ) running version 7.2. The vulnerability occurs due to missing authentication checks when submitting a SOAP request to the /EemAdminService/EemAdmin page to get information about connected SMDAgents allowing an attacker to send HTTP requests ( SSRF ) and execute OS commands on the connected SMDAgent. Works stable in connected SMDAgent with Java version 1.8. Successful exploitation will allow unauthenticated remote attackers to get a reverse shell from connected to the SolMan agent as the user under which it runs SMDAgent service , which is usually daaadm.  ， cve : advisories | CVE-2020-6207  ，  ， desc :  #   ，  # This module requires Metasploit : https : /metasploit.com/download  ，  # Current source : https : /github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework  ，   ， 'Description' => %q{  ， This module exploits the CVE-2020-6207 vulnerability within the SAP EEM servlet ( tc ~ smd ~ agent ~ application ~ eem ) of  ， SAP Solution Manager ( SolMan ) running version 7.2.
