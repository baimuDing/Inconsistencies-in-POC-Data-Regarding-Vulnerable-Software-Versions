Proof of concept code included.  ， cve:advisories | CVE-2012-3819  ， date_time:Oct 2, 2012  ， desc:Overview  ，  ， DartWebserver.Dll is an HTTP server provided by Dart Comunications  ， (dart.com). It is distributed intheir PowerTCP/Webserver For ActiveX  ， product and likely other similar products.  ， \"Build web applications in any familiar software development  ， environment. Use WebServer for ActiveX to add web-based access to  ， traditional compiled applications.\"  ， Version 1.9 and prior is vulnerable to a stack overflow exception,  ， these maybe generated by producing large requests to the application,  ， e.g. \"a\" * 5200000 + \"\\n\\n\"  ， Analysis  ，  ， During the processing of incoming HTTP requests the server collects  ， data until it encounters a \"\\n\\n\" sentinel. If the request is large,  ， multiple copies are made and stored on the stack, this consumes the  ， amount of stack space available to the process quickly, leading to a  ， stack overflow exception being thrown. This exception is not handled  ， and will typically lead to the termination of the parent process. Some  ， variations may exist per system depending on pre-existing memory  ， conditions and modification of Proof Of Concept (PoC) code may be"
