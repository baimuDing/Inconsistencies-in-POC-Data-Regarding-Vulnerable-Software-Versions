    "text": "title : Reprise License Manager 14.2 User Enumeration  ， detail : Reprise License Manager version 14.2 suffers from a user enumeration vulnerability. The vendor has contacted Packet Storm to note that in v15.1 they have fixed this issue by giving the same ambiguous error whether username , password , or both are entered incorrectly.  ， cve : advisories | CVE-2021-44155  ，  ， desc :  # Product : Reprise License Manager 14.2  ，  # Vendor : Reprise Software  ，  # CVE ID : CVE-2021-44155  ，  # Vulnerability Title : Unauthenticated User Enumeration  ，  # Severity : Low  ，  # Author ( s )  : Mark Staal Steenberg , Bilal El Ghoul , Gionathan Armando Reale , Andreas Fyhn Andersen , Oliver Lind Nordestgaard  ，  # Date : 2021-11-25  ，  ， Introduction :   ， An issue was discovered in /goform/login_process in RLM 14.2. When an attacker attempts to login , the response if an username is valid includes \"Login Failed\" , but does not include this string if the username is invalid. This allows an attacker to enumerate valid users.  ， Vulnerability :   ， This vulnerability is triggered upon failed authentication , if an attacker supplies an invalid user with an invalid password no error message is given however if an attacker supplies the application with a valid user with an invalid password an error message is displayed informing the user \"Login Failed\". The difference in response can be abused in order to allow an attacker to enumerate valid users.  ，   ， Recommendation :   ， We recommend displaying generic error messages upon failed authentication to mitigate the possibility of an attacker enumerating valid users.",
