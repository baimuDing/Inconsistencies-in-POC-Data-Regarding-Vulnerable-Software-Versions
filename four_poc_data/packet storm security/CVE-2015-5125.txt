One of these mitigations , at Vector access time , compares the Vector's in-memory length with a representation of the same length XOR'ed with a secret cookie. The bypass comes about because the secret cookie value is stored inside a structure , and a pointer to that structure is stored alongside the Vector length.  ， cve : advisories | CVE-2015-5125  ，  ， desc : ",
