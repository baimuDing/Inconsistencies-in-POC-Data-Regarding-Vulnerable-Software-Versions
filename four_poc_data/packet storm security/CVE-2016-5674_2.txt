These NVR are Linux embedded video recording systems that can manage a number of cameras and are used worldwide by public institutions , banks , SME's , etc. They also provide a software package to NETGEAR that adds network video recording and monitoring capabilities to the well known NETGEAR ReadyNAS Network Attached Storage systems.  ， The web interface contains a number of critical vulnerabilities that can be abused by unauthenticated attackers. These consist of monitoring backdoors left in the PHP files that are supposed to be used by NUUO's engineers , hardcoded credentials , poorly sanitised input and a buffer overflow which can be abused to achieve code execution on NUUO's devices as root , and on NETGEAR as the admin user.  ， Although only the NVRmini 2 , NVRsolo , Crystal and ReadyNAS Surveillance devices are known to be affected , it is likely that the same code is used in other NUUO devices or even other third party devices ( the firmware is littered with references to other devices like NUUO Titan ) . However this has not been confirmed as it was not possible to access all NUUO and third party devices that might be using the same code.  ， A special thanks to CERT/CC ( https : /www.cert.org/ ) for assistance with disclosing the vulnerabilities to the vendors [ 1 ] . Metasploit exploits for # 1 ,  # 2 and # 3 have been released.  ， > Technical details :   ，  # 1  ， Vulnerability : Improper Input Validation ( leading to remote code execution )   ， CVE-2016-5674  ， Attack Vector : Remote  ， Constraints : None , can be exploited by an unauthenticated attacker  ， Affected products / versions :   ， - NUUO NVRmini 2 , firmware v1.7.5 to 3.0.0 ( older firmware versions might be affected )   ， - NUUO NVRsolo , firmware v1.0.0 to 3.0.0  ， - ReadyNAS Surveillance , v1.1.1 to v1.4.1 ( affects both x86 and ARM versions , older versions might be affected )   ， - Other NUUO products that share the same web interface might be affected",
