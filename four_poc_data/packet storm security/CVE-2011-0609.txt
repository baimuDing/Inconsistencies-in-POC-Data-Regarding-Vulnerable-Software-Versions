    "text": "title : Adobe Flash Player AVM Bytecode Verification  ， detail : This Metasploit module exploits a vulnerability in AVM2 action script virtual machine used in Adobe Flash Player versions 9.0 through 10. The AVM fails to properly verify bytecode streams prior to executing it. This can cause uninitialized memory to be executed. Utilizing heap spraying techniques to control the uninitialized memory region it is possible to execute arbitrary code. Typically Flash Player is not used as a standalone application. Often , SWF files are embedded in other file formats or specifically loaded via a web browser. Malcode was discovered in the wild which embedded a malformed SWF file within an Excel spreadsheet. This exploit is based off the byte stream found within that malcode sample.  ， cve : advisories | CVE-2011-0609  ，  ， desc :  #   ，  #  $ Id : adobe_flashplayer_avm.rb 12091 2011-03-23 04 : 41 : 48Z bannedit $   ，   ，  # This file is part of the Metasploit Framework and may be subject to  ，  # redistribution and commercial restrictions.
