    "text": "title : Samsung Internet Browser 6.2.01.12 SOP Bypass / UXSS  ， detail : Samsung Internet Browser version 6.2.01.12 allows remote attackers to bypass the Same Origin Policy and obtain sensitive information via crafted JavaScript code.  ， cve : advisories | CVE-2017-17859  ，  ， desc : From : https : /poctestblog.blogspot.co.uk/2017/12/samsung-internet-browser-sop-bypassuxss.html  ， Samsung Internet Browser SOP Bypass/UXSS  ， There is a Same Origin Policy bypass / Universal Cross Site Scripting issue in Samsung Internet Browser ( tested on latest version - 6.2.01.12 ) .  ， First of all , using the combination of MHTML and XSLT ends up resulting in a weird interaction. When you create an empty Iframe via MHTML and give a normal header and combine MHTML with XSLT , the browser renders them and confuse as its origin is from a pre-instantiated empty iframe. I hosted a quick Proof-Of-Concept page to test this vulnerability , please have a test on latest Samsung Internet browser ( version - 6.2.01.12 ) .  ， http : /prooftestdomain.hol.es/test/test.php  ， I attached a POC image below to show that Samsung Internet Browser says its origin is https : /google.com and document.domain returns https : /google.com while in reality we are in my test host domain.  ， Following is Proof Of Concept code , you need to upload .mht and .php file. When you visit .php file the exploit runs successfully and bypasses Same Origin Policy to achieve UXSS.  ， test.mht file content :   ， MIME-Version : 1.0  ， Content-Type : multipart/related ; ",
