Therefore , this bug is subject to a 7 day disclosure deadline.  ， VULNERABILITY DETAILS  ， When turbofan compiles code that performs a Map transition , it usually installs a CodeDependency so that the resulting code is deoptimized should the target Map ever be deprecated ( meaning that the code should now transition to a different Map ) . This is done through the TransitionDependencyOffTheRecord function [ 1 ] . This function will only install the dependency if the target Map can be deprecated , which is determined by Map : CanBeDeprecated [ 2 ]  , shown next",
