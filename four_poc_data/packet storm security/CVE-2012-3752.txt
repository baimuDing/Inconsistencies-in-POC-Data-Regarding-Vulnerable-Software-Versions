    "text": "title : Apple QuickTime 7.7.2 TeXML Style Element font-table Field Stack Buffer Overflow  ， detail : This Metasploit module exploits a vulnerability found in Apple QuickTime. When handling a TeXML file , it is possible to trigger a stack-based buffer overflow , and then gain arbitrary code execution under the context of the user. This is due to the QuickTime3GPP.gtx component not handling certain Style subfields properly , as the font-table field , which is used to trigger the overflow in this module. Because of QuickTime restrictions when handling font-table fields , only 0x31-0x39 bytes can be used to overflow , so at the moment DEP/ASLR bypass hasn't been provided. The module has been tested successfully on IE6 and IE7 browsers ( Windows XP and Vista ) .  ， cve : advisories | CVE-2012-3752 , OSVDB-87087  ，  ， desc :  #   ，  # This file is part of the Metasploit Framework and may be subject to  ，  # redistribution and commercial restrictions.
