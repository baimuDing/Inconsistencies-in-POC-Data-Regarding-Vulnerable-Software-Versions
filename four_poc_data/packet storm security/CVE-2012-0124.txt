    "text": "date_time:Jul 2, 2012 ， title:HP Data Protector Create New Folder Buffer Overflow  ， detail:This Metasploit module exploits a stack buffer overflow in HP Data Protector 5. The overflow occurs in the creation of new folders, where the name of the folder is handled in a insecure way by the dpwindtb.dll component. While the overflow occurs in the stack, the folder name is split in fragments in this insecure copy. Because of this, this module uses egg hunting to search a non corrupted copy of the payload in the heap. On the other hand the overflowed buffer is stored in a frame protected by stack cookies, because of this SEH handler overwrite is used. Any user of HP Data Protector Express is able to create new folders and trigger the vulnerability. Moreover, in the default installation the 'Admin' user has an empty password. Successful exploitation will lead to code execution with the privileges of the \"dpwinsdr.exe\" (HP Data Protector Express Domain Server Service) process, which runs as SYSTEM by default.  ， cve:advisories | CVE-2012-0124, OSVDB-80105  ， date_time:Jul 2, 2012  ， desc:#  ， # This file is part of the Metasploit Framework and may be subject to  ， # redistribution and commercial restrictions.
