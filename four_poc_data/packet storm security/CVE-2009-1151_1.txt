    "text": "title : PhpMyAdmin Config File Code Injection  ， detail : This Metasploit module exploits a vulnerability in PhpMyAdmin's setup feature which allows an attacker to inject arbitrary PHP code into a configuration file. The original advisory says the vulnerability is present in phpMyAdmin versions 2.11.x < 2.11.9.5 and 3.x < 3.1.3.1 ; this module was tested on 3.0.1.1. The file where our payload is written ( phpMyAdmin/config/config.inc.php ) is not directly used by the system , so it may be a good idea to either delete it or copy the running config ( phpMyAdmin/config.inc.php ) over it after successful exploitation.  ， cve : advisories | CVE-2009-1151  ，  ， desc :  #   ，  #  $ Id : phpmyadmin_config.rb 7724 2009-12-06 05 : 50 : 37Z jduck $   ，   ，  # This file is part of the Metasploit Framework and may be subject to  ，  # redistribution and commercial restrictions.
