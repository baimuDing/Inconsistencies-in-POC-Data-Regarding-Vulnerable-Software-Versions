    "text": "title : Moodle Authenticated Spelling Binary Remote Code Execution  ， detail : Moodle allows an authenticated user to define spellcheck settings via the web interface. The user can update the spellcheck mechanism to point to a system-installed aspell binary. By updating the path for the spellchecker to an arbitrary command , an attacker can run arbitrary commands in the context of the web application upon spellchecking requests. This Metasploit module also allows an attacker to leverage another privilege escalation vuln. Using the referenced XSS vuln , an unprivileged authenticated user can steal an admin sesskey and use this to escalate privileges to that of an admin , allowing the module to pop a shell as a previously unprivileged authenticated user. This module was tested against Moodle version 2.5.2 and 2.2.3.  ， cve : advisories | CVE-2013-3630 , CVE-2013-4341  ，  ， desc :  #   ，  # This module requires Metasploit : https : /metasploit.com/download  ，  # Current source : https : /github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework  ，  ， require 'rexml/document'  ，  ， 'Description' => %q{  ， Moodle allows an authenticated user to define spellcheck settings via the web interface.  ， The user can update the spellcheck mechanism to point to a system-installed aspell binary.  ， By updating the path for the spellchecker to an arbitrary command , an attacker can run  ， arbitrary commands in the context of the web application upon spellchecking requests.  ， This module also allows an attacker to leverage another privilege escalation vuln.  ， Using the referenced XSS vuln , an unprivileged authenticated user can steal an admin sesskey  ， and use this to escalate privileges to that of an admin , allowing the module to pop a shell  ， as a previously unprivileged authenticated user.  ， This module was tested against Moodle version 2.5.2 and 2.2.3.  ， }",
