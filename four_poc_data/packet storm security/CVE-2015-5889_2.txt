    "text": "title : issetugid (  ) + rsh + libmalloc OS X Local Root  ， detail : The default root-suid binary /usr/bin/rsh on Mac OS X uses execv (  ) in an insecure manner. /usr/bin/rsh will invoke /usr/bin/rlogin if launched with only a host argument , without dropping privileges or clearing the environment. This exploit will pass \"MallocLogFile\" to /usr/bin/rsh , which is then passed on to rlogin and interpreted by libmalloc to create a root-owned file with partially controlled contents at /etc/crontab which gives a rootshell via sudo. Tested on 10.9.5 / 10.10.5 but it most likely works on much older versions too.  ， cve : advisories | CVE-2015-5889  ，  ， desc :  # CVE-2015-5889 : issetugid (  ) + rsh + libmalloc osx local root  ，  # tested on osx 10.9.5 / 10.10.5  ，  # jul/2015  ，  # by rebel",
