The connector fails to properly handle specially crafted HTTP POST requests, resulting a buffer overflow due to the insecure usage of sprintf. Currently, this module works over Windows systems without DEP, and has been tested with Windows 2000 / XP. In addition, the Weblogic Apache plugin version is fingerprinted with a POST request containing a specially crafted Transfer-Encoding header.  ， cve:advisories | CVE-2008-3257, OSVDB-47096  ， date_time:May 18, 2012  ， desc:#  ， # This file is part of the Metasploit Framework and may be subject to  ， # redistribution and commercial restrictions.
