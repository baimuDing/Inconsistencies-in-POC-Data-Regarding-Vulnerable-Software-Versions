    "text": "title : Pentaho Business Server Authentication Bypass / SSTI / Code Execution  ， detail : Hitachi Vantara Pentaho Business Analytics Server prior to versions 9.4.0.1 and 9.3.0.2 , including 8.3.x is vulnerable to an authentication bypass ( CVE-2022-43939 ) and a Server Side Template Injection ( SSTI ) vulnerability ( CVE-2022-43769 ) that can be chained together to achieve unauthenticated code execution as the user running the Pentaho Business Analytics Server. The first vulnerability ( CVE-2022-43939 ) is an authentication bypass which stems from a regex that allows any URL that ends in \"/\" , followed by \"require\" , optionally \"-js\" or \"-cfg\" , any character , and then the string \"js\" followed optionally by \"?\" and then any characters of the attacker's choice. The second ( CVE-2022-43769 ) is a server side template injection. This vulnerability allows remote code execution by making a GET request to /api/ldap/config/ldapTreeNodeChildren and setting the url parameter to ThymeLeaf template code. By abusing the ability to execute arbitrary Java classes within Thymeleaf templates , an attacker can execute arbitrary commands as the user running the Pentaho Business Analytics Server.  ， cve : advisories | CVE-2022-43769 , CVE-2022-43939  ，  ， desc :  #   ，  # This module requires Metasploit : https : /metasploit.com/download  ，  # Current source : https : /github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework  ，   ， 'Description' => %q{  ， Hitachi Vantara Pentaho Business Analytics Server prior to versions 9.4.0.1 and 9.3.0.2 , including 8.3.x is  ， vulnerable to an authentication bypass ( CVE-2022-43939 ) and a Server Side Template Injection ( SSTI ) vulnerability  ，  ( CVE-2022-43769 ) that can be chained together to achieve unauthenticated code execution as the user  ， running the Pentaho Business Analytics Server.  ， The first vulnerability ( CVE-2022-43939 ) is an authentication bypass which stems from a regex that allows any  ， URL that ends in \"/\" , followed by \"require\" , optionally \"-js\" or \"-cfg\" , any character , and then the string  ， \"js\" followed optionally by \"?\" and then any characters of the attacker's choice.  ， The second ( CVE-2022-43769 ) is a server side  ， template injection.
