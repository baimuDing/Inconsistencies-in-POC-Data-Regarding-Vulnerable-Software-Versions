    "text": "title : Windows ANI LoadAniIcon (  ) Chunk Size Stack Overflow ( HTTP )   ， detail : This Metasploit module exploits a buffer overflow vulnerability in the LoadAniIcon (  ) function in USER32.dll. The flaw can be triggered through Internet Explorer 6 and 7 by using the CURSOR style sheet directive to load a malicious .ANI file. The module can also exploit Mozilla Firefox by using a UNC path in a moz-icon URL and serving the .ANI file over WebDAV. The vulnerable code in USER32.dll will catch any exceptions that occur while the invalid cursor is loaded , causing the exploit to silently fail when the wrong target has been chosen. This vulnerability was discovered by Alexander Sotirov of Determina and was rediscovered , in the wild , by McAfee.  ， cve : advisories | CVE-2007-0038  ，  ， desc :  #   ，  #  $ Id : ms07_017_ani_loadimage_chunksize.rb 9085 2010-04-15 16 : 08 : 27Z jduck $   ，   ，  # This file is part of the Metasploit Framework and may be subject to  ，  # redistribution and commercial restrictions.
