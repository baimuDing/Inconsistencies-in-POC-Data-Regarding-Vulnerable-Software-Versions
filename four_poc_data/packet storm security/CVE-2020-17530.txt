    "text": "date_time:Dec 24, 2020 ， title:Apache Struts 2 Forced Multi OGNL Evaluation  ， detail:The Apache Struts framework, when forced, performs double evaluation of attribute values assigned to certain tags attributes such as id. It is therefore possible to pass in a value to Struts that will be evaluated again when a tag's attributes are rendered. With a carefully crafted request, this can lead to remote code execution. This vulnerability is application dependant. A server side template must make an affected use of request data to render an HTML tag attribute.  ， cve:advisories | CVE-2019-0230, CVE-2020-17530  ， date_time:Dec 24, 2020  ， desc:#  ， # This module requires Metasploit: https:/metasploit.com/download  ， # Current source: https:/github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework  ，   ， 'Description' => %q{  ， The Apache Struts framework, when forced, performs double evaluation of attributes' values assigned to certain tags  ， attributes such as id.
