Using this Log Analyzer  ， software , organizations can automate the entire process of managing terabytes  ， of machine generated logs by collecting , analyzing , searching , reporting ,   ， and archiving from one central location. This event log analyzer software  ， helps to mitigate internal threats , conduct log forensics analysis , monitor  ， privileged users and comply to different compliance regulatory bodies  ， by intelligently analyzing your logs and instantly generating a variety of  ， reports like user activity reports , regulatory compliance reports ,   ， historical trend reports , and more.  ， Business recommendation :   ，  ， During a penetration test , multiple vulnerabilities have been identified  ， that are based on severe design/implementation flaws in the application.  ， It is highly recommended not to use this software until a thorough  ， security review has been performed by security professionals and all  ， identified issues have been resolved.  ， Vulnerability description :   ，  ， 1 ) Unauthenticated remote code execution  ， ME EventLog Analyzer contains a \"agentUpload\" servlet which is used by Agents  ， to send log data as zip files to the central server. Files can be uploaded  ， without  ， authentication and are stored/decompressed in the \"data\" subdirectory.  ， As the decompress procedure is handling the file names in the ZIP file in a  ， insecure way it is possible to store files in the web root of server. This can  ， be used to upload/execute code with the rights of the application server.  ， 2 ) Authorization issues  ， The EventLog Analyzer web interface does not check if an authenticated has  ， sufficient permissions to access certain parts of the application. A low  ， privileged  ， user ( for example guest ) can therefore access critical sections of the web  ， interface ,   ， by directly calling the corresponding URLs. This can be used to access the  ， database  ， browser of the application which gives the attacker full access to the database.",
