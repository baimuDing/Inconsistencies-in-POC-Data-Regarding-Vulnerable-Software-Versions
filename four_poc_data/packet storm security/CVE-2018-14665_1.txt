    "text": "title : Xorg X11 Server Local Privilege Escalation  ， detail : This Metasploit module has been tested with AIX 7.1 and 7.2 , and should also work with 6.1. Due to permission restrictions of the crontab in AIX , this module does not use cron , and instead overwrites /etc/passwd in order to create a new user with root privileges. All currently logged in users need to be included when /etc/passwd is overwritten , else AIX will throw 'Cannot get \"LOGNAME\" variable' when attempting to change user. The Xorg '-fp' parameter used in the OpenBSD exploit does not work on AIX , and is replaced by '-config' , in conjuction with ANSI-C quotes to inject newlines when overwriting /etc/passwd.  ， cve : advisories | CVE-2018-14665  ，  ， desc :  #   ，  # This module requires Metasploit : https : /metasploit.com/download  ，  # Current source : https : /github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework",
