Versions SysInfo 10-H81 and above are not affected.  ， cve:advisories | CVE-2018-7268  ， date_time:Jun 18, 2018  ， desc:MagniComp SysInfo Information Exposure [CVE-2018-7268]  ，  ， The latest version of this advisory is available at:  ， https:/sintonen.fi/advisories/magnicomp-sysinfo-information-exposure.txt  ， Overview  ，  ， MagniComp SysInfo contains a information exposure vulnerability through debug  ， functionality.  ， Description  ，  ， Due to a combination of setuid binary and verbose debugging, MagniComp SysInfo can be  ， used to read any file on the system owned by root (uid 0).  ， Impact  ，  ， A local unprivileged user is able to read any root (uid 0) owned file on the system,  ， regardless of the file permissions. Confidential information such as password hashes  ， (/etc/shadow) or other secrets (such as log files, private keys) can be leaked to  ， the attacker. The vulnerability has a confidentiality impact, but has no direct impact  ， on system integrity or availability.  ， Details  ，  ， The discovered vulnerabilities, described in more detail below, enable the attack  ， described here in brief.  ， 1. A local attacker executes the following command to obtain access to /etc/shadow:  ， $ /opt/sysinfo/bin/sysinfo -licensevalid /etc/shadow -debug 2>&1 | grep PARSE:  ， 2. The attacker performs further attacks on the exposed password hashes  ， The attacker is able to use the vulnerability to expose other confidential  ， information, too, such as private keys, configuration and log files.  ， Vulnerabilities  ，  ， 1. CWE-215: Information Exposure Through Debug Information [CVE-2018-7268]  ， The SysInfo mcsiwrapper is installed setuid root. The -licensevalid option reads  ， the license file, parses it and returns validity status of the license. Due to an  ， oversight enabling debug output with -debug also outputs the contents of the file to  ， the stderr while performing the parsing, exposing the file contents in the process.  ， The vulnerability can only be used to read files owned by root (uid 0). An attempt  ， to read a file owned by someone else is met with the following error:  ， \"mcsiwrapper: CERROR: Option -licensefile is unsafe: \"/home/user/foo\" REASON: Path  ， must be owned by uid 0 or uid 0 when running setuid: path owned by uid 1000.\"  ， Vulnerable versions  ，  ， The following SysInfo versions are confirmed vulnerable:  ， - Linux/Unix/Mac SysInfo versions up and including 10.0 (H80)  ， Notably MagniComp SysInfo is bundled with the BMC BladeLogic Automation product. With  ， BMC BladeLogic installations the tool can be found from the following location:  ， /opt/bmc/bladelogic/RSCD/nativetool/bin  ， Mitigation  ，  ， 1. Upgrade to SysInfo 10-H81 or later  ， Similar or prior work  ，  ， 1. Unrelated earlier privilege escalation vulnerability CVE-2017-6516 -  ， https:/cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-6516"
