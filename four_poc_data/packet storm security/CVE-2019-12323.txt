In addition this can potentially be leveraged for post exploit persistence with SYSTEM privileges, if physical access or malware is involved. If a physical attacker or malware can set its own program for the service failure recovery options, it can be used to maintain persistence. Afterwards, it can be triggered by sending a malicious request to DoS the service, which in turn can start the attackers recovery program. The attackers program can then try restarting the affected service to try an stay unnoticed by calling \"sc start HCServerService\". Services failure flag recovery options for \"enabling actions for stops or errors\" and can be set in the services \"Recovery\" properties tab or on the command line. Authentication is not required to reach the vulnerable service, this was tested successfully on Windows 7/10.  ， cve:advisories | CVE-2019-12323  ， date_time:Jun 17, 2019"
