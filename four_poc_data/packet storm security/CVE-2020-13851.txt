    "text": "title : Pandora FMS 7.0 NG 7X Remote Command Execution  ， detail : This Metasploit module exploits a vulnerability ( CVE-2020-13851 ) in Pandora FMS versions 7.0 NG 742 , 7.0 NG 743 , and 7.0 NG 744 ( and perhaps older versions ) in order to execute arbitrary commands. This module takes advantage of a command injection vulnerability in th e Events feature of Pandora FMS. This flaw allows users to execute arbitrary commands via the target parameter in HTTP POST requests to the Events function. After authenticating to the target , the module attempts to exploit this flaw by issuing such an HTTP POST request , with the target parameter set to contain the payload. If a shell is obtained , the module will try to obtain the local MySQL database password via a simple grep command on the plaintext /var/www/html/pandora_console/include/config.php file. Valid credentials for a Pandora FMS account are required. The account does not need to have admin privileges. This module has been successfully tested on Pandora 7.0 NG 744 running on CentOS 7 ( the official virtual appliance ISO for this version ) .  ， cve : advisories | CVE-2020-13851  ，  ， desc :  #   ，  # This module requires Metasploit : https : /metasploit.com/download  ，  # Current source : https : /github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework  ，   ， 'Description' => %q{  ， This module exploits a vulnerability ( CVE-2020-13851 ) in Pandora  ， FMS versions 7.0 NG 742 , 7.0 NG 743 , and 7.0 NG 744 ( and perhaps  ， older versions ) in order to execute arbitrary commands.  ， This module takes advantage of a command injection vulnerability in the  ， `Events` feature of Pandora FMS.
