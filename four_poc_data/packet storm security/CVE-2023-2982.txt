This is due to insufficient encryption on the user being supplied during a login validated through the plugin. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to log in as any existing user on the site , such as an administrator , if they know the email address associated with that user. This was partially patched in version 7.6.4 and fully patched in version 7.6.5.  ， Technical Analysis  ， The WordPress Social Login and Register plugin , according to its settings , provides the ability for users to login to a WordPress website using a social login through various popular social media platforms and service providers. Examining the code reveals that there is a case with custom apps , where the data is sent encrypted during the login process. The data required for login must be decrypted using the secret key at the request.  ，  [ View this code snippet on the blog ]   ， While encrypting this information would normally provide protection against manipulating the request and prevent identity spoofing , we unfortunately found that the encryption key is hardcoded in vulnerable versions of the plugin , which means that threat actors also had access to the key which was not unique per WordPress installation. This makes it possible for attackers to craft a valid request containing a properly encrypted email address which vulnerable versions of the plugin use during the login process to determine the user.  ， Ultimately , this makes it possible for threat actors to bypass authentication and gain access to arbitrary accounts on sites running a vulnerable version of the plugin. As always , authentication bypass vulnerabilities and resulting access to high privileged user accounts , make it easy for threat actors to completely compromise a vulnerable WordPress site and further infect the victim.",
