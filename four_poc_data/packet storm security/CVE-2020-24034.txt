    "text": "title : Sagemcom F @ ST 5280 Privilege Escalation  ， detail : Sagemcom F @ ST 5280 routers using firmware version 1.150.61 , and possibly others , have an insecure deserialization vulnerability that allows any authenticated user to perform a privilege escalation to any other user. By making a request with valid sess_id , nonce , and ha1 values inside of the serialized session cookie , an attacker may alter the user value inside of this cookie , and assume the role and permissions of the user specified. By assuming the role of the user internal , which is inaccessible to end users by default , the attacker gains the permissions of the internal account , which includes the ability to flash custom firmware to the router , allowing the attacker to achieve a complete compromise.  ， cve : advisories | CVE-2020-24034  ，  ， desc : < ! -  ，  # Exploit Title : Sagemcom router insecure deserialization > privilege  ， escalation  ，  # Date : 08-31-2020  ，  # Exploit Author : Ryan Delaney",
