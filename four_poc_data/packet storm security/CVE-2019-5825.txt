    "text": "title : Google Chrome 72 / 73 Array.map Corruption  ， detail : This Metasploit module exploits an issue in Chrome version 73.0.3683.86 ( 64 bit ) . The exploit corrupts the length of a float in order to modify the backing store of a typed array. The typed array can then be used to read and write arbitrary memory. The exploit then uses WebAssembly in order to allocate a region of RWX memory , which is then replaced with the payload. The payload is executed within the sandboxed renderer process , so the browser must be run with the -no-sandbox option for the payload to work correctly.  ， cve : advisories | CVE-2019-5825  ，  ， desc :  #   ，  # This module requires Metasploit : https : /metasploit.com/download  ，  # Current source : https : /github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework",
