    "text": "title : VMware vRealize Log Insight Unauthenticated Remote Code Execution  ， detail : VMware vRealize Log Insights versions 8.x contain multiple vulnerabilities , such as directory traversal , broken access control , deserialization , and information disclosure. When chained together , these vulnerabilities allow a remote , unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the underlying operating system as the root user. This Metasploit module achieves code execution via triggering a RemotePakDownloadCommand command via the exposed thrift service after obtaining the node token by calling a GetConfigRequest thrift command. After the download , it will trigger a PakUpgradeCommand for processing the specially crafted PAK archive , which then will place the JSP payload under a certain API endpoint ( pre-authenticated ) location upon extraction for gaining remote code execution. Successfully tested against version 8.0.2.  ， cve : advisories | CVE-2022-31704 , CVE-2022-31706 , CVE-2022-31711  ，  ， desc :  #   ，  # This module requires Metasploit : https : /metasploit.com/download  ，  # Current source : https : /github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework  ，  ， require 'rex/proto/thrift'  ， require 'rex/stopwatch'  ，  ， 'Description' => %q{  ， VMware vRealize Log Insights versions v8.x contains multiple vulnerabilities , such as  ， directory traversal , broken access control , deserialization , and information disclosure.  ， When chained together , these vulnerabilities allow a remote , unauthenticated attacker to  ， execute arbitrary commands on the underlying operating system as the root user.  ， This module achieves code execution via triggering a `RemotePakDownloadCommand` command  ， via the exposed thrift service after obtaining the node token by calling a `GetConfigRequest`  ， thrift command.
