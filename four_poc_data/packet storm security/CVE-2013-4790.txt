Besides a generic lookup for most prominent mail providers , information of existing external mail accounts of other users , including users from other contexts , is used to discover potential mail server settings. To validate the discovered settings , a login attempt is performed at the discovered mail server. This attack becomes possible if the victim is using OX AppSuite UI , using the OX6 UI does not trigger this vulnerability.  ， Risk :   ， An attacker can inject incorrect host information for popular mail services by providing misleading server settings. These settings are then used to automatically validate other users external mail accounts which includes transferring their external mail accounts login name and password. An attacker can potentially intercept user credentials for external mail accounts by logging all authentication data sent to the rogue IMAP server.",
