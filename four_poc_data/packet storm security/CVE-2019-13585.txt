By sending a specially crafted HTTP request to the HTTP  ， server , the application can be crashed causing a denial-of-service  ， condition.  ， Remote code execution may also be possible , but was not confirmed  ， by SySS GmbH. Gaining control over the instruction pointer ( EIP ) of this  ， 32 bit application by exploiting the stack-based buffer overflow  ， vulnerability was successful.  ，  ， Proof of Concept ( PoC )  :   ， SySS GmbH developed a proof-of-concept exploit that crashes  ， vrimserve.exe. It is to note that the exploit gives control over the EIP  ， register , which is an important prerequisite for remote code execution.  ， curl \"http : / $ {target_host} : 8090/namedrobots/folder/dir/<1268 bytes>BBBBCCCCCCCCC\"  ， The bytes denoted as B overwrite the EIP register.  ，  ， Solution :   ， The vendor has not yet released a security update.  ， It is recommended not making the remote admin web server ( vrimserve.exe )   ， available to untrusted networks.",
