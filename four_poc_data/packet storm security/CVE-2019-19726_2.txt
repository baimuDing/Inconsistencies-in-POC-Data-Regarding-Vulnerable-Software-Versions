    "text": "title : Qualys Security Advisory - OpenBSD Dynamic Loader Privilege Escalation  ， detail : Qualys discovered a local privilege escalation in OpenBSD's dynamic loader ( ld.so ) . This vulnerability is exploitable in the default installation ( via the set-user-ID executable chpass or passwd ) and yields full root privileges. They developed a simple proof of concept and successfully tested it against OpenBSD 6.6 ( the current release )  , 6.5 , 6.2 , and 6.1 , on both amd64 and i386 ; other releases and architectures are probably also exploitable.  ， cve : advisories | CVE-2019-19726  ，  ， desc : Qualys Security Advisory  ， Local Privilege Escalation in OpenBSD's dynamic loader ( CVE-2019-19726 )   ，  ， Contents  ，  ， Summary  ， Analysis  ， Demonstration  ， Acknowledgments  ，  ， Summary  ，  ， We discovered a Local Privilege Escalation in OpenBSD's dynamic loader  ，  ( ld.so )  : this vulnerability is exploitable in the default installation  ，  ( via the set-user-ID executable chpass or passwd ) and yields full root  ， privileges.  ， We developed a simple proof of concept and successfully tested it  ， against OpenBSD 6.6 ( the current release )  , 6.5 , 6.2 , and 6.1 , on both  ， amd64 and i386 ; other releases and architectures are probably also  ， exploitable.  ，  ， Analysis  ，  ， In this section , we analyze a step-by-step execution of our proof of  ， concept :   ，  ， 1/ We execve (  ) the set-user-ID /usr/bin/chpass , but first :   ， 1a/ we set the LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable to one single dot  ，  ( the current working directory ) and approximately ARG_MAX colons ( the  ， maximum number of bytes for the argument and environment list )  ; as  ， described in man ld.so :   ， LD_LIBRARY_PATH  ， A colon separated list of directories , prepending the default  ， search path for shared libraries. This variable is ignored for  ， set-user-ID and set-group-ID executables.  ， 1b/ we set the RLIMIT_DATA resource limit to ARG_MAX * sizeof ( char *  )   ，  ( 2MB on amd64 , 1MB on i386 )  ; as described in man setrlimit :   ， RLIMIT_DATA The maximum size ( in bytes ) of the data segment for a  ， process ; this includes memory allocated via malloc ( 3 ) and  ， all other anonymous memory mapped via mmap ( 2 ) .  ，  ， 2/ Before the main (  ) function of chpass is executed , the _dl_boot (  )   ， function of ld.so is executed and calls _dl_setup_env (  )  :   ， 262 void",
