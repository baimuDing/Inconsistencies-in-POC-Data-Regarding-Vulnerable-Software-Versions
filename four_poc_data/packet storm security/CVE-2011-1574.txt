    "text": "title : VideoLAN VLC ModPlug ReadS3M Stack Buffer Overflow  ， detail : This Metasploit module exploits an input validation error in libmod_plugin as included with VideoLAN VLC 1.1.8. All versions prior to version 1.1.9 are affected. By creating a malicious S3M file , a remote attacker could execute arbitrary code. Although other products that bundle libmodplug may be vulnerable , this module was only tested against VLC. NOTE : As of July 1st , 2010 , VLC now calls SetProcessDEPPoly to permanently enable NX support on machines that support it. As such , this module is capable of bypassing DEP , but not ASLR.  ， cve : advisories | CVE-2011-1574 , OSVDB-72143  ，  ， desc :  #   ，  #  $ Id : vlc_modplug_s3m.rb 12282 2011-04-08 15 : 48 : 53Z jduck $   ，   ，  # This file is part of the Metasploit Framework and may be subject to  ，  # redistribution and commercial restrictions.
