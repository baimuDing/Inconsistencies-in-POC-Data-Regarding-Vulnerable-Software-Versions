    "text": "title : Internet Explorer DTHML Behaviors Use After Free  ， detail : This Metasploit module exploits a use-after-free vulnerability within the DTML behaviors functionality of Microsoft Internet Explorer versions 6 and 7. This bug was discovered being used in-the-wild and was previously known as the \"iepeers\" vulnerability. The name comes from Microsoft's suggested workaround to block access to the iepeers.dll file. According to Nico Waisman , \"The bug itself is when trying to persist an object using the setAttribute , which end up calling VariantChangeTypeEx with both the source and the destination being the same variant. So if you send as a variant an IDISPATCH the algorythm will try to do a VariantClear of the destination before using it. This will end up on a call to PlainRelease which decref the reference and clean the object.\" NOTE : Internet Explorer 8 and Internet Explorer 5 are not affected.  ， cve : advisories | CVE-2010-0806  ，  ， desc :  #   ，  #  $ Id : ms10_018_ie_behaviors.rb 8968 2010-03-31 22 : 36 : 10Z jduck $   ，   ，  # This file is part of the Metasploit Framework and may be subject to  ，  # redistribution and commercial restrictions.
