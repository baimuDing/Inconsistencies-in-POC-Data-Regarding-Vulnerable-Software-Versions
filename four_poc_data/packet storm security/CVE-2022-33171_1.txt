    "text": "title : TypeORM 0.3.7 Information Disclosure  ， detail : TypeORM version 0.3.7 suffers from an information disclosure vulnerability.  ， cve : advisories | CVE-2022-33171  ，  ， desc : I found what I think is a vulnerability in the latest typeorm 0.3.7.  ， TypeORM v0.3 has a new findOneBy method instead of findOneById (  ) and it is  ， the only way to get a record by id  ， Sending undefined as a value in this method removes this parameter from the  ， query. This leads to the data exposure.  ， For example :   ， Users.findOneBy ( {id : req.query.id} ) with /?id=12345 produces SELECT * FROM  ， Users WHERE id=12345 LIMIT 1 while removing id from the query string  ， produces SELECT * FROM Users LIMIT 1  ， Maintainer also does not consider this a vulnerability and stated the  ， root cause is bad input validation. I tried to contact Snyk , but they  ， took the author's position. I still think it is a major vulnerability  ， Vulnerable app : ",
