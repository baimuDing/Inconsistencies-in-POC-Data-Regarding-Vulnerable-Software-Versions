Details provided.  ， cve : advisories | CVE-2006-0377  ，  ， desc : =  ， INTERNET SECURITY AUDITORS ALERT 2006-002  ， - Original release date : February 27 , 2006  ， - Last revised : February 27 , 2006  ， - Discovered by : Vicente Aguilera Diaz  ， - Severity : 3/5  ，  ， I. VULNERABILITY  ，  ， IMAP/SMTP Injection in SquirrelMail  ， II. BACKGROUND  ，  ， SquirrelMail is a standards-based webmail package written in PHP4. It  ， includes built-in pure PHP support for the IMAP and SMTP protocols ,   ， and all pages render in pure HTML 4.0 ( with no JavaScript required )   ，  ， requirements and is very easy to configure and install. SquirrelMail  ， has all the functionality you would want from an email client ,   ， including strong MIME support , address books , and folder manipulation.  ， The product homepage is http : /www.squirrelmail.org.  ， III. DESCRIPTION  ，  ， SquirrelMail provides a graphical interface to interact with mail  ， servers across the IMAP and SMTP protocols.  ， Improper command and information validation transmitted by  ， SquirrelMail to the mail servers during the normal use of this  ， application ( mailbox management , e-mail reading and sending , etc. )   ， facilitates that an authenticate malicious user could inject arbitrary  ， IMAP/SMTP commands into the mail servers used by SquirrelMail across  ， parameters used by the webmail front-ent in its communication with  ， these mail servers.  ， This is become dangerous because the injection of these commands  ， allows an intruder to evade restrictions imposed at application level ,   ， and exploit vulnerabilities that could exist in the mail servers  ， through IMAP/SMTP commands.  ， IV. PROOF OF CONCEPT  ，  ， = IMAP example ( 1.4.2 version ) =  ， SquirrelMail Vulnerable parameter : \"mailbox\"  ， When a user clicks in the subject of an e-mail , he creates a GET  ， request as :   ， http : /<victim>/src/read_body.php?mailbox=INBOX&passed_id=1&startMessage=1&show_more=0  ， A malicious user can modify the value of the \"mailbox\" parameter and  ， inject any IMAP command.  ， The IMAP command injection has the following structure :   ， http : /<victim>/src/read_body.php?mailbox=INBOX%22%0D%0<ID>  ， <INJECT_IMAP_COMMAND_HERE>%0D%0A<ID>  ， %20SELECT%20%22INBOX&passed_id=<CODE>&startMessage=1",
