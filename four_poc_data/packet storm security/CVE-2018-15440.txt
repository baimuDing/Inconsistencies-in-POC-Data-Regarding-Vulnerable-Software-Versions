    "text": "title : Cisco ISE 2.4.0 XSS / Remote Code Execution  ， detail : Cisco Identity Services Engine ( ISE ) version 2.4.0 suffers from cross site scripting , java deserialization , and in conjunction can lead to remote code execution. Full exploit provided.  ， cve : advisories | CVE-2017-5641 , CVE-2018-15440  ，  ， desc : > Multiple vulnerabilities in Cisco Identity Services Engine ( Unauth XSS to RCE as root )   ， > Discovered by Pedro Ribeiro ( pedrib @ gmail.com )  , Agile Information Security and Dominik Czarnota ( dominik.b.czarnota @ gmail.com )   ，  ， Disclosure : 20/01/2019 / Last updated : 05/02/2019  ， > Background and product information  ， From the vendor's website [ 1 ]  :   ， The Cisco Identity Services Engine ( ISE ) is your one-stop solution to streamline security policy management and reduce operating costs. With ISE , you can see users and devices controlling access across wired , wireless , and VPN connections to the corporate network.  ， Cisco ISE allows you to provide highly secure network access to users and devices. It helps you gain visibility into what is happening in your network , such as who is connected , which applications are installed and running , and much more. It also shares vital contextual data , such as user and device identities , threats , and vulnerabilities with integrated solutions from Cisco technology partners , so you can identify , contain , and remediate threats faster.\"  ， > Summary  ， ISE is distributed by Cisco as a virtual appliance. We have analysed version 2.4.0.357 and found three vulnerabilities : an unauthenticated stored cross site scripting , a authenticated Java deserialization vulnerability leading to remote code execution as an unprivileged user , and a privilege escalation from that unprivileged user to root.  ， By putting them all together , we can achieve remote code execution as root , provided we can trap an administrator into visiting the page vulnerable to the stored cross site scripting. A Ruby exploit that implements this full exploit chain ( described in more detail at 'Exploitation summary' , at the end of this file ) is available in [ 2 ] .  ， All the vulnerabilities in this advisory were found independently by Agile Information Security. However , vulnerability # 2 ( Unsafe Flex AMF Java Object Deserialization ) was also found and reported to Cisco by Olivier Arteau of Groupe Technologie Desjardins [ 3 ] and vulnerability # 3 ( Privilege Escalation via Incorrect sudo File Permissions ) was also found and reported to Cisco by Hector Cuesta [ 4 ] .  ， Cisco refused to credit Agile Information Security with finding vulnerabilities # 2 and # 3 , and also refused to provide a CVE for both these vulnerabilities , saying regarding # 3 that \"This issue has been evaluated as a hardening effort to improve the security posture of the device. According with our Security vulnerability policy , we request do not request a CVE assignment for issue with a Severity Impact Rating ( SIR ) lower than Medium. This issue will be fixed in the upcoming ISE release\".  ， At the time of the latest update , Cisco still recommends version 2.4.0.357 - affected by all the vulnerabilities in this advisory - as the \"Suggested Release\" in their software download page.  ， These actions show Cisco is incredibly negligent with regards to the security of their customers. They are still shipping ( and recommending ) a product version vulnerable to unauthenticated remote code execution , with a fully working public exploit and no way to track fixes or fixed versions for these vulnerabilities.  ， Agile Information Security would like to thank Beyond Security's SSD Secure Disclosure programme for helping us disclose these vulnerabilities to Cisco , and publishing the advisory on their site [ 5 ] .  ， > Technical details :   ，  # 1  ， Vulnerability : Stored Cross Site Scripting  ， CVE-2018-15440  ， Attack Vector : Remote  ， Constraints : None ; exploitable by an unauthenticated attacker  ， Affected versions : confirmed on ISE virtual appliance v2.4.0.357  ， The LiveLogSettingsServlet , available at /admin/LiveLogSettingsServlet , contains a stored cross site scripting vulnerability.  ， The doGet (  ) HTTP request handler takes in an Action parameter as a HTTP query variable , which can be \"read\" or \"write\".  ， With the \"write\" parameter , it calls the writeLiveLogSettings (  ) function which then takes several query string variables , such as Columns , Rows , Refresh_rate and Time_period.  ， The content of these query string variables is then written to /opt/CSCOcpm/mnt/dashboard/liveAuthProps.txt , and the server responds with a 200 OK. These parameters are not validated , and can contain any text.",
