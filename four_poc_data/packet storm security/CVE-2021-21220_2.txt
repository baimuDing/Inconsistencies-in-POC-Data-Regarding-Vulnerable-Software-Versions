    "text": "title : Google Chrome XOR Typer Out-Of-Bounds Access / Remote Code Execution  ， detail : This Metasploit module exploits an issue in the V8 engine on x86_x64 builds of Google Chrome versions prior to 89.0.4389.128/90.0.4430.72 when handling XOR operations in JIT'd JavaScript code. Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the V8 process. As the V8 process is normally sandboxed in the default configuration of Google Chrome , the browser must be run with the -no-sandbox option for the payload to work correctly.  ， cve : advisories | CVE-2021-21220  ，  ， desc :  #   ，  # This module requires Metasploit : https : /metasploit.com/download  ，  # Current source : https : /github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework  ，   ， 'Description' => %q{  ， This module exploits an issue in the V8 engine on x86_x64 builds of Google Chrome before 89.0.4389.128/90.0.4430.72  ， when handling XOR operations in JIT'd JavaScript code.
