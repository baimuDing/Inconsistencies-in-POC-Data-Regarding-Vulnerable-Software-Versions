BACKGROUND  ， The runpriv program is a setuid root application that checks to see if a  ， regular user has been granted privileges to execute a certain predefined  ， command , and if so it runs the command found in the directory  ， /usr/sysadm/privbin with root privileges. It is installed by default  ， under multiple versions of IRIX 6.  ， II. DESCRIPTION  ， Local exploitation of a design error vulnerability in the runpriv  ， command included in multiple versions of Silicon Graphics Inc.'s IRIX  ， could allow for arbitrary code execution as the root user.  ， The runpriv program is a setuid root application that checks to see if a  ， regular user has been granted privileges to execute a certain predefined  ， command , and if so it runs the command found in the directory  ， /usr/sysadm/privbin with root privileges.  ， The vulnerability specifically exists because runpriv unsafely executes  ， commands after it has verified a user's privileges. This allows an  ， attacker who has been given privileged access to one binary in  ， /usr/sysadm/privbin to effectively execute any command as root. To  ， exploit this vulnerability , all that is required is appending a string  ， of the form \"command to execute\" to the end of an otherwise authorized  ， and legitimate command. For example , if a user has been authorized to  ， run the mountfs utility , they can exploit this vulnerability in the  ， following way :   ， /usr/sysadm/bin/runpriv mountfs -s test -d / -o \\ |   ， \"ksh -c 'echo r00t : 0 : 0 : r00t : /tmp : /bin/sh > /etc/passwd'\"  ， su r00t -c \"chown root : sys /tmp/passwd123 ;   ， mv /tmp/passwd123 /etc/passwd ;   ， chmod 644 /etc/passwd ; su\"  ， This will have the effect of adding an administrative user \"r00t\" to the  ， system with no password , which allows for trivial privilege escalation.  ， III. ANALYSIS  ， Exploitation requires an attacker to have access to an account which has  ， been granted usage of a binary in the /usr/sysadm/privbin directory. As  ， root must explicitly allow such privileges , the impact of this  ， vulnerability is lessened significantly. Exploitation does not require  ， any knowledge of application internals , making exploitation trivial ,   ， even for unskilled attackers.  ， IV. DETECTION  ， iDEFENSE has confirmed the existence of this vulnerability in SGI IRIX  ， version 6.5.22 ( maintenance ) . It is suspected that previous and later  ， versions of both the feature and maintenance revisions of IRIX 6.5 are  ， also vulnerable.  ， V. WORKAROUND  ， Only grant runpriv privileges to trusted users with secure accounts.  ， Alternately , remove the setuid and setgid bits from runpriv :   ， chmod ug-s /usr/sysadm/bin/runpriv  ， VI. VENDOR RESPONSE  ， A vendor advisory for this vulnerability is to be posted at :   ， http : /www.sgi.com/support/security/advisories.html  ， Vendor patch 7004 for IRIX 6.5.27 and 6.5.28 is available at :   ， http : /support.sgi.com/  ， VII. CVE INFORMATION  ， The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures ( CVE ) project has assigned the  ， name CAN-2005-2925 to this issue. This is a candidate for inclusion in  ， the CVE list ( http : /cve.mitre.org )  , which standardizes names for  ， security problems.  ， VIII.
