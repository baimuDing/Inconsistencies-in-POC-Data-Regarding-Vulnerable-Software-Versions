    "text": "title : PRTG Command Injection  ， detail : PRTG versions prior to 18.2.39 suffer from a command execution vulnerability.  ， cve : advisories | CVE-2018-9276  ，  ， desc : Bugtraq ,   ， I ( Josh Berry ) discovered an authenticated command injection vulnerability  ， in the Demo PowerShell notification script provided by versions of PRTG  ， Network Monitor prior to 18.2.39. The PowerShell notifications demo script  ， on versions of the application prior to 18.2.39 do not properly sanitize  ， input in the Parameter field. The web application provides a security  ， control around running executables/scripts as part of a notification , but  ， the demo PowerShell script contains a command injection vulnerability. As a  ， proof of concept , the following value can be passed in the Parameter  ， field , resulting in the creation of a test account named pentest :   ， Test.txt ; net user pentest p3nT3st ! /add  ， This bypasses the security control in place for the application. I notified  ， Paessler AG , the developer of the application , and they have since patched  ， the issue and assigned a CVE of CVE-2018-9276. Additional details are  ， provided below :   ，  # Vulnerability Title : PRTG < 18.2.39 Command Injection Vulnerability",
