I then had to give my mac to Apple for a couple of weeks for some repairs so only got around to testing 4.0.22 at the end of last week.  ， Unfortunately , 4.0.22 is still exploitable and the subsequent release of 4.0.23 did not fix the issue. Hashicorp reacted much faster this time , taking only a few days to issue a patch instead of a few months and 4.0.24 does fix the issue.  ， As discussed before the plugin installs a \"sudo helper\" encrypted ruby script and four architecture-specific wrappers into ~ /.vagrant.d/gems/2.2.5/gems/vagrant-vmware-fusion-4.0.22/bin  ， vagrant_vmware_desktop_sudo_helper  ， vagrant_vmware_desktop_sudo_helper_wrapper_darwin_386  ， vagrant_vmware_desktop_sudo_helper_wrapper_darwin_amd64  ， vagrant_vmware_desktop_sudo_helper_wrapper_linux_386  ， vagrant_vmware_desktop_sudo_helper_wrapper_linux_amd64  ， The wrapper that matches the system architecture will be made suid root the first time any vagrant box is up'd. When a vagrant box is started the wrapper script elevates privileges and then executes the ruby sudo helper script.",
