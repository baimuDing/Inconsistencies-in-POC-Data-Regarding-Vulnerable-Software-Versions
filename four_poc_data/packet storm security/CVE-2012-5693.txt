Therefore even if the web server hosting SPF GUI is not accessible from the Internet ( which is a case for the majority of pentesters ) the vulnerabilities can still be easily exploited via a local/internal network , or even from the Internet via CSRF vector. In default installation of Smartphone Pentest Framework its web server port and application path of its GUI are easily predictable : localhost : 80/frameworkgui/  ， Please refer to HTB23123 advisory ( https : /www.htbridge.com/advisory/HTB23122 ) for detailed attack scenarios examples.  ， 1 ) Multiple OS Command Execution Vulnerabilities in Smartphone Pentest Framework ( SPF )  : CVE-2012-5878",
