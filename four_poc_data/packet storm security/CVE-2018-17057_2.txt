    "text": "title : TCPDF 6.2.19 Deserialization / Remote Code Execution  ， detail : TCPDF versions 6.2.19 and below suffer from a deserialization vulnerability that can allow for remote code execution.  ， cve : advisories | CVE-2018-17057  ，  ， desc : CVE-2018-17057 : phar deserialization in TCPDF might lead to RCE  ，  ， Affected products  ，  ， TCPDF <= 6.2.19  ， Background  ，  ， \"Started in 2002 , TCPDF is now one of the world's most active Open Source  ， projects , used daily by millions of users and included in thousands of CMS  ， and Web applications.\" - https : /tcpdf.org/  ， \"PHP library for generating PDF documents on-the-fly.\" -  ， https : /github.com/tecnickcom/TCPDF  ， Description  ，  ， TCPDF allows the developers to insert HTML code inside the PDF , which will  ， be translated to a similar-looking design during PDF creation. For example  ， it is possible to insert basic HTML tags , such as \"img\" or \"b\" and have the  ， image and bold text placed in the output PDF.  ， The library allows also to include custom CSS rules by defining a \"link\"  ， tag , like the following :   ， <link type=\"text/css\" href=\"style.css\">  ， While it is a nice feature to have for the developer , it may cause problems  ， in case the PDF creation script is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting ( or  ， \"Code Injection\" ) issues through which an attacker can inject arbitrary  ， HTML code. For example during an invoice creation , an attacker can use its  ， information written on the invoice to insert a malicious \"link\" tag  ， pointing to a local phar archive and trigger a PHP Object Injection through  ， the phar : / scheme once the web application reads that file.  ， Exploit  ，  ， In order to test this vulnerability it's enough to clone the project from  ， github and checkout a vulnerable version , such as 6.2.19 :   ， git clone https : /github.com/tecnickcom/TCPDF.git & cd TCPDF & git  ， checkout tags/6.2.19  ， After that it is possible to craft a phar archive containing a malicious  ， PHP Object and potentially trigger a RCE , here is a vulnerable code which",
