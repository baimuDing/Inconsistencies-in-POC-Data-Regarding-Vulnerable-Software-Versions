    "text": "date_time:Jun 11, 2015 ， title:Libmimedir VCF Memory Corruption Proof Of Concept  ， detail:Libmimedir suffers from a memory corruption vulnerability. Adding two NULL bytes to the end of a VCF file allows a user to manipulate free() calls which occur during it's lexer's memory clean-up procedure. This could lead to exploitable conditions such as crafting a specific memory chunk to allow for arbitrary code execution.  ， cve:advisories | CVE-2015-3205  ， date_time:Jun 11, 2015  ， desc:#!/usr/bin/python  ， # libmimedir-free.py  ，  ， # Libmimedir VCF Memory Corruption PoC (CVE-2015-3205)  ，  ， # Jeremy Brown [jbrown3264/gmail]  ， # June 2015  ，  ， # -Synopsis-  ，  ， # Adding two NULL bytes to the end of a VCF file allows a user to manipulate free() calls  ， # which occur during it's lexer's memory clean-up procedure.

There's already  ， # a stale bug (1049214) to upgrade to latest upstream and there wasn't a movement to work on a  ， # fix with this one. yy_get_next_buffer() in dirlex.c would likely take the patch."
