    "text": "title : Kibana Timelion Prototype Pollution Remote Code Execution  ， detail : Kibana versions before 5.6.15 and 6.6.1 contain an arbitrary code execution flaw in the Timelion visualizer. An attacker with access to the Timelion application could send a request that will attempt to execute javascript code. This leads to an arbitrary command execution with permissions of the Kibana process on the host system. Exploitation will require a service or system reboot to restore normal operation. The WFSDELAY parameter is crucial for this exploit. Setting it too high will cause MANY shells ( 50-100+ )  , while setting it too low will cause no shells to be obtained. WFSDELAY of 10 for a docker image caused 6 shells.  ， cve : advisories | CVE-2019-7609  ，  ， desc :  #   ，  # This module requires Metasploit : https : /metasploit.com/download  ，  # Current source : https : /github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework  ，   ， 'Description' => %q{  ， Kibana versions before 5.6.15 and 6.6.1 contain an arbitrary code execution flaw in the Timelion visualizer.  ， An attacker with access to the Timelion application could send a request that will attempt to execute  ， javascript code.
