    "text": "title : Microsoft RRAS Service RASMAN Registry Overflow  ， detail : This Metasploit module exploits a registry-based stack overflow in the Windows Routing and Remote Access Service. Since the service is hosted inside svchost.exe , a failed exploit attempt can cause other system services to fail as well. A valid username and password is required to exploit this flaw on Windows 2000. When attacking XP SP1 , the SMBPIPE option needs to be set to 'SRVSVC'. Exploiting this flaw involves two distinct steps - creating the registry key and then triggering an overwrite based on a read of this key. Once the key is created , it cannot be recreated. This means that for any given system , you only get one chance to exploit this flaw. Picking the wrong target will require a manual removal of the following registry key before you can try again : HKEY_USERS\\.DEFAULT\\Software\\Microsoft\\RAS Phonebook  ， cve : advisories | CVE-2006-2370  ，  ， desc :  #   ，  #  $ Id $   ，   ，  # This file is part of the Metasploit Framework and may be subject to  ，  # redistribution and commercial restrictions.
