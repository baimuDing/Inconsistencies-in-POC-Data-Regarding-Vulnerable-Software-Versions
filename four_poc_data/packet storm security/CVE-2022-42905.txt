    "text": "title : wolfSSL WOLFSSL_CALLBACKS Heap Buffer Over-Read  ， detail : wolfSSL versions prior to 5.5.2 suffer from a heap buffer over-read with WOLFSSL_CALLBACKS and can be triggered with a single Client Hello message.  ， cve : advisories | CVE-2022-42905  ，  ， desc :  # wolfSSL before 5.5.2 : Heap-buffer over-read with WOLFSSL_CALLBACKS  ，  ，  # INFO  ，  ， The CVE project has assigned the id CVE-2022-42905 to this issue.  ， Severity : 9.1 CRITICAL  ， Affected version : before 5.5.2  ， End of embargo : Ended October 28 , 2022  ， Blog Post : https : /blog.trailofbits.com/2023/01/12/wolfssl-vulnerabilities-tlspuffin-fuzzing-ssh/  ，  # SUMMARY  ，  ， If wolfSSL callback functions are enabled ( i.e. , the flag `WOLFSSL_CALLBACKS` is  ， enabled )  , then a malicious client or network attacker can send a Client Hello  ， message to a server that when parsed by the server will trigger a buffer  ， over-read on the heap of at least 5 bytes. Similarly , a malicious server or a  ， network attacker can send a Hello Retry Request message to a client that when  ， parsed by the client will trigger a buffer over-read on the heap of at least 15  ， bytes.  ， The `AddPacketInfo` is given a buffer that should be the input buffer and that  ， actually is shifted by 5 bytes on the left , i.e. , instead of reading  ， `input [ 0 ] .input [ length ] ` , the function will read `input [ -5 ] .input [ length ] ` and  ， store it in a buffer that is exposed through the wolfSSL API. Note that `input`  ， is stored on the heap and `input [ -5 ] ` to `input [ -1 ] ` might store sensitive data  ， that should not be given to `AddPacketInfo` , for example when callback functions  ， are used as logging facility ( through the API functions `wolfSSL_accept_ex` and  ， `wolfSSL_connect_ex` ) .  ， This buffer over-read can be triggered at a server with a single Client Hello  ， message. We have confirmed this with a proof-of-concept test case given below on  ， wolfSSL 5.5.0 , on the version from the master branch , and on version 5.4.0. A  ， similar buffer over-read can be triggered at a client with the same wolfSSL  ， versions.  ，  # DETAILS",
