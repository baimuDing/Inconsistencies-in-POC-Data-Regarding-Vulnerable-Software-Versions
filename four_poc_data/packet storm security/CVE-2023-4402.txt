This allows unauthenticated attackers to inject a PHP Object. No POP chain is present in the vulnerable plugin. If a POP chain is present via an additional plugin or theme installed on the target system , it could allow the attacker to delete arbitrary files , retrieve sensitive data , or execute code.  ， Description : Insecure Deserialization/PHP Object Injection via products  ， Affected Plugin : Essential Blocks , Essential Blocks Pro  ， Plugin slug : essential-blocks  ， Vendor : WPDeveloper  ， Affected versions : <= 4.2.0 ( Free ) and <= 1.1.0 ( Pro )   ， CVE ID : CVE-2023-4402  ， CVSS score : 8.1 ( High )   ， CVSS Vector : CVSS : 3.1/AV : N/AC : H/PR : N/UI : N/S : U/C : H/I : H/A : H  ， Researcher : Marco Wotschka  ， Fully Patched Version : 4.2.1 & 1.1.1  ， The Essential Blocks plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to PHP Object Injection in versions up to , and including , 4.2.0 via deserialization of untrusted input in the get_products function. This allows unauthenticated attackers to inject a PHP Object. No POP chain is present in the vulnerable plugin. If a POP chain is present via an additional plugin or theme installed on the target system , it could allow the attacker to delete arbitrary files , retrieve sensitive data , or execute code.  ， Technical Analysis  ， The Essential Blocks plugin provides more than 40 blocks to its users including sliders , buttons , pricing tables , maps and others. An API is provided to query for posts and products via the queries and products API endpoints which do not require authentication.  ， Unfortunately , query data and attributes were passed in PHPs serialized string format and were subsequently unserialized by the functions get_posts ( for the queries endpoint ) and get_products ( for the products endpoint ) in /includes/API/PostBlock.php and /includes/API/Product.php , respectively.  ， php-objection-injection-posts  ， get_posts function  ， php-objection-injection-products  ， get_products function  ， Attackers could utilize this to inject a PHP object with properties of their choosing. The presence of a PHP POP chain can make it possible for an attacker to execute arbitrary code , create and delete files and potentially ultimately take over a vulnerable site. Fortunately , no POP chain is present in the Essential Blocks plugin , which means an attacker would require another plugin or theme installed on the vulnerable site with a POP chain present in order to fully exploit these vulnerabilities. It is worth mentioning that POP chains can sometimes be found in popular plugins and libraries which include destructor methods that perform cleanup tasks when an Object is destroyed or deserialized.  ， Despite the lack of a POP chain in the Essential Blocks plugin itself , and the complexity involved in exploiting these types of vulnerabilities , a successful attack often leads to severe consequences. We explain how PHP Object Injections work in this blog post , if you are interested to find out more about their inner workings.",
