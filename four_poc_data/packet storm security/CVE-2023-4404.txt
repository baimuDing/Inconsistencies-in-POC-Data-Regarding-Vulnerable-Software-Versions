This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to specify their user role by supplying the role parameter during a registration.  ， Technical Analysis  ， Charitable is a plugin that makes it possible to create donation forms and fundraising campaigns in WordPress.  ， The plugin provides a shortcode (  [ charitable_registration ]  ) for a custom registration form. However , insecure implementation of the plugins registration functionality allows users to specify arbitrary parameters when creating an account. Examining the code reveals that there is no predefined list of user parameters , nor a ban list of dangerous parameters. This makes it possible to register an administrator user by supplying the role parameter , with the value of the role they would like assigned to their account , such as administrator.  ，  [ VIEW THIS CODE SNIPPET ON THE BLOG ]   ， The update_core_user method in the Charitable_User class  ， As with any Privilege Escalation vulnerability , this can be used for complete site compromise. Once an attacker has gained administrative user access to a WordPress site they can then manipulate anything on the targeted site as a normal administrator would. This includes the ability to upload plugin and theme files , which can be malicious zip files containing backdoors , and modifying posts and pages which can be leveraged to redirect site users to other malicious sites.",
