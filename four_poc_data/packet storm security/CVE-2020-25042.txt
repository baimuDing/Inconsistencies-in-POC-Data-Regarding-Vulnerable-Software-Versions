    "text": "title : MaraCMS 7.5 Remote Code Execution  ， detail : This Metasploit module exploits an arbitrary file upload vulnerability in MaraCMS versions 7.5 and below in order to execute arbitrary commands. The module first attempts to authenticate to MaraCMS. It then tries to upload a malicious PHP file to the web root via an HTTP POST request to codebase/handler.php. If the php target is selected , the payload is embedded in the uploaded file and the module attempts to execute the payload via an HTTP GET request to this file. For the linux and windows targets , the module uploads a simple PHP web shell. Subsequently , it leverages the CmdStager mixin to deliver the final payload via a series of HTTP GET requests to the PHP web shell. Valid credentials for a MaraCMS admin or manager account are required. This module has been successfully tested against MaraCMS 7.5 running on Windows Server 2012 ( XAMPP server ) .  ， cve : advisories | CVE-2020-25042  ，  ， desc :  #   ，  # This module requires Metasploit : https : /metasploit.com/download  ，  # Current source : https : /github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework  ，   ， 'Description' => %q{  ， This module exploits an arbitrary file upload vulnerability in  ， MaraCMS 7.5 and prior in order to execute arbitrary commands.  ， The module first attempts to authenticate to MaraCMS.
