These are new vulnerabilities  ， in Domino, which I've found at 03.05.2012 together with other holes.  ， In August 2012 I've wrote about vulnerabilities in IBM Lotus Domino, which  ， were related to Domino WebMail. I'll add new vulnerabilities in WebMail to  ， previous two holes. Which had CVE-2012-3302 and described in IBM Security  ， Bulletin: Aug-2012 IBM Lotus Domino Web Server Cross-Site Scripting  ， Vulnerabilities (http:/www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21608160).  ， IBM haven't created new CVE and new advisory for these vulnerabilities (at  ， least they didn't tell me and I didn't find it at their site).  ，  ， Affected products:  ，  ， Vulnerable are IBM Lotus Domino 8.5.4 and previous versions. These  ， vulnerabilities have been fixed in Domino 9.0. Which was recently released.  ， So every user of Domino can upgrade to latest 9.0 version or to use  ， workaround for previous versions (provided bellow).  ，  ， Details:  ，  ， Cross-Site Scripting (WASC-08):  ， The attack is possible via data: and vbscript: URI."
