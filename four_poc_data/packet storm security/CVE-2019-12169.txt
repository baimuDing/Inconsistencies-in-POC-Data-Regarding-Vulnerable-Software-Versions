The zip  ， archive takes advantage of a directory traversal vulnerability that will  ， cause the PHP file to be dropped in the root server directory ( `htdocs`  ，  ， encoded payload that allows for remote command execution on the  ， target server. The zip archive can be uploaded via two vectors , the  ， `Import New Language` function and the `Patcher` function. The module  ， first uploads the archive via `Import New Language` and then attempts to  ， execute the payload via an HTTP GET request to the PHP file in the root  ， server directory. If no session is obtained , the module creates another  ， zip archive and attempts exploitation via `Patcher`.  ， Valid credentials for an ATutor admin account are required. This module  ， has been successfully tested against ATutor 2.2.4 running on Windows 10  ，  ( XAMPP server ) .  ， }",
