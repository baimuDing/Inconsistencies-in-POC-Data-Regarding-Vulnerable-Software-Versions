    "text": "title : Firefox 8/9 AttributeChildRemoved (  ) Use-After-Free  ， detail : This Metasploit module exploits a use-after-free vulnerability in Firefox 8/8.0.1 and 9/9.0.1. Removal of child nodes from the nsDOMAttribute can allow for a child to still be accessible after removal due to a premature notification of AttributeChildRemoved. Since mFirstChild is not set to NULL until after this call is made , this means the removed child will be accessible after it has been removed. By carefully manipulating the memory layout , this can lead to arbitrary code execution.  ， cve : advisories | CVE-2011-3659  ，  ， desc :  #   ，  # This file is part of the Metasploit Framework and may be subject to  ，  # redistribution and commercial restrictions.
