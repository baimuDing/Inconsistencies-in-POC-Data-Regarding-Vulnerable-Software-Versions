    "text": "title : EyesOfNetwork AutoDiscovery Target Command Execution  ， detail : This Metasploit module exploits multiple vulnerabilities in EyesOfNetwork version 5.3 and prior in order to execute arbitrary commands as root. This module takes advantage of a command injection vulnerability in the target parameter of the AutoDiscovery functionality within the EON web interface in order to write an Nmap NSE script containing the payload to disk. It then starts an Nmap scan to activate the payload. This results in privilege escalation because the apache user can execute Nmap as root. Valid credentials for a user with administrative privileges are required. However , this module can bypass authentication via two methods , i.e. by generating an API access token based on a hard-coded key , and via SQL injection. This module has been successfully tested on EyesOfNetwork 5.3 with API version 2.4.2.  ， cve : advisories | CVE-2020-8654 , CVE-2020-8655 , CVE-2020-8656 , CVE-2020-8657  ，  ， desc :  #   ，  # This module requires Metasploit : https : /metasploit.com/download  ，  # Current source : https : /github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework",
