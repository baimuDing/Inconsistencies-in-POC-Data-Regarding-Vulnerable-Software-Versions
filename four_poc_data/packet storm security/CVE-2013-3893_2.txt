    "text": "title : Microsoft Internet Explorer SetMouseCapture Use-After-Free  ， detail : This Metasploit module exploits a use-after-free vulnerability that targets Internet Explorer 9 on Windows 7. The flaw most likely exists in versions 6/7/8/9/10/11. It was initially found in the wild in Japan , but other regions such as English , Chinese , Korean , etc , were targeted as well. The vulnerability is due to how the mshtml ! CDoc : SetMouseCapture function handles a reference during an event. An attacker first can setup two elements , where the second is the child of the first , and then setup a onlosecapture event handler for the parent element. The onlosecapture event seems to require two setCapture (  ) calls to trigger , one for the parent element , one for the child. When the setCapture (  ) call for the child element is called , it finally triggers the event , which allows the attacker to cause an arbitrary memory release using document.write (  )  , which in particular frees up a 0x54-byte memory. The exact size of this memory may differ based on the version of IE. After the free , an invalid reference will still be kept and passed on to more functions , eventually arriving in function MSHTML ! CTreeNode : GetInterface , and causing a crash ( or arbitrary code execution ) when this function attempts to use this reference to call what appears to be a PrivateQueryInterface due to the offset ( 0x00 ) . To mimic the same exploit found in the wild , this module will try to use the same DLL from Microsoft Office 2007 or 2010 to leverage the attack.  ， cve : advisories | CVE-2013-3893 , OSVDB-97380  ，  ， desc :  #   ，  # This file is part of the Metasploit Framework and may be subject to  ，  # redistribution and commercial restrictions.
