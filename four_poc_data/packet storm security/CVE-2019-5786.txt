    "text": "title : Chrome 72.0.3626.119 FileReader Use-After-Free  ， detail : This exploit takes advantage of a use after free vulnerability in Google Chrome 72.0.3626.119 running on Windows 7 x86. The FileReader.readAsArrayBuffer function can return multiple references to the same ArrayBuffer object , which can be freed and overwritten with sprayed objects. The dangling ArrayBuffer reference can be used to access the sprayed objects , allowing arbitrary memory access from Javascript. This is used to write and execute shellcode in a WebAssembly object. The shellcode is executed within the Chrome sandbox , so you must explicitly disable the sandbox for the payload to be successful.  ， cve : advisories | CVE-2019-5786  ，  ， desc :  #   ，  # This module requires Metasploit : https : /metasploit.com/download  ，  # Current source : https : /github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework",
