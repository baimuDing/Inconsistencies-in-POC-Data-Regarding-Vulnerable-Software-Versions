    "text": "title : WordPress Download Manager 3.2.50 Arbitrary File Deletion  ， detail : WordPress Download Manager plugin versions 3.2.50 and below suffer from an arbitrary file deletion vulnerability.  ， cve : advisories | CVE-2022-2431  ，  ， desc : Description : Authenticated ( Contributor+ ) Arbitrary File Deletion  ， Affected Plugin : Download Manager  ， Plugin Slug : download-manager  ， Plugin Developer : W3 Eden , Inc.  ， Affected Versions : <= 3.2.50  ， CVE ID : CVE-2022-2431  ， CVSS Score : 8.8 ( High )   ， CVSS Vector : CVSS : 3.1/AV : N/AC : L/PR : L/UI : N/S : U/C : H/I : H/A : H  ， Researcher/s : Chloe Chamberland  ， Fully Patched Version : 3.2.51  ， Download Manager is a popular WordPress plugin designed to allow site content creators to share downloadable files that are stored as posts. These downloads can be displayed on the front-end of the WordPress site for users to download. Unfortunately , vulnerable versions of the plugin contain a bypass in how the downloadable file is stored and subsequently deleted upon post deletion that make it possible for attackers to delete arbitrary files on the server.  ， More specifically , vulnerable versions of the plugin register the deleteFiles (  ) function that is called via the before_delete_post hook. This hook is triggered right before a post has been deleted and its intended functionality in this case is to delete any files that may have been uploaded and associated with a download post.  ， At first glance this looks like a relatively safe functionality assuming the originally supplied file path is validated. Unfortunately , however , that is not the case as the path to the file saved with the download post is not validated to ensure it was a safe file type or in a location associated with a download post. This means that a path to an arbitrary file with any extension can be supplied via the file [ files ]  [  ] parameter when saving a post and that would be the file associated with the download post. On many configurations an attacker could supply a path such as /var/www/html/wp-config.php that would associate the sites WordPress configuration file with the download post.  ， When the user goes to permanently delete the download post the deleteFiles (  ) function will be triggered by the before_delete_post hook and the supplied file will be deleted , if it exists.  ， This can be used by attackers to delete critical files hosted on the server. The wp-config.php file in particular is a popular target for attackers as deletion of this file would disconnect the existing database from the compromised site and allow the attacker to re-complete the initial installation process and connect their own database to the site. Once a database is connected , they would have access to the server and could upload arbitrary files to further infect the system.  ， This vulnerability requires contributor-level access and above to exploit , so it serves as an important reminder to make sure you dont provide contributor-level and above access to untrusted users. Its also important to validate that all users have strong passwords to ensure your site wont subsequently be compromised as a result of a vulnerability like this due to an unauthorized actor gaining access via a weak or compromised password.",
