Certain versions of the firmware for the DPC2100 model feature a  ， web interface that is vulnerable to the following issues. Testing was  ， performed on a DPC2100R2 modem, with firmware v2.0.2r1256-060303. Other  ， WebSTAR modems and firmware versions may be vulnerable as well.  ， 1. Cross-site request forgery (CSRF). Several features provided by the web  ， interface fail to properly establish sessions that restrict access to  ， authorized users, including forms for changing the administrative password,  ， resetting the modem, and installing new firmware. An attacker may create a  ， malicious website that, when visited by a victim, updates these settings on the  ， victim's modem on the victim's behalf without their authorization or need for  ， any additional user interaction. This can be used to deny service by resetting  ， the modem or wiping the firmware, to change the default administrative  ， password, or potentially to steal information from the victim by installing  ， malicious firmware. This issue has been assigned CVE-2010-2025.  ， 2. Insufficient authentication. The modem's access control scheme, which has  ， levels numbered from 0-2 (or 0-3 on some other models), is not properly checked  ， before performing operations that should require authentication, including  ， resetting the modem and installing new firmware. The modem requires the proper  ， access level to access web interface pages containing forms that allow a user  ， to perform these actions, but does not properly authenticate the pages that  ， actually carry out these actions. By sending a POST request directly to these  ， pages, these actions may be performed without any authentication. Attacks may  ， be performed by an attacker on the local network or by leveraging the CSRF  ， vulnerability. This issue has been assigned CVE-2010-2026.  ， =Identifying Vulnerable Installations=  ， Most home installations of this modem will feature a web interface that is  ， accessible at \"http:/192.168.100.1\". The following proof-of-concept code may  ， be used to test for vulnerability. It leverages the CSRF vulnerability to  ， change the access level of your modem to the most restrictive settings (a  ， harmless action). If your modem is vulnerable, then you will be presented with  ， a message stating that your settings have been successfully updated. If you  ， are greeted with a page stating there was a \"Password confirmation error\", then  ， your modem password has been changed from the default but you are still  ， vulnerable. If you are greeted with an HTTP authentication form or other  ， message, then your model is not vulnerable."
