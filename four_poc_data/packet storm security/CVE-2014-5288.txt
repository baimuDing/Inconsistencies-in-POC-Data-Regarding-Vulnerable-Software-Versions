I had a chance to test it and this blog post summarises some of the most interesting vulnerabilities I have discovered and which have not been published yet. For those of you who want to try it as well , you can get a free trial version here : http : /kemptechnologies.com/server-load-balancing-appliances/virtual-loadbalancer/vlm-download  ，   ， By default , Kemp web administrative interface is protected by Basic authentication , so the vulnerabilities discussed in the post below can either be exploited attacking an authenticated user via CSRF or XSS based attacks.  ，   ， The following vulnerabilities were discovered when looking at Kemp Load Master v.7.1-16 and some of them should be fixed in the latest version ( 7.1-20b or later ) .  ，   ， Change logs of the fixed issues can be found at the following page :   ，   ， \"PD-2183 Functions have been added to sanitize input in the WUI in order to resolve some security issues fix for CVE-2014-5287 and CVE-2014-5288\".  ，   ， Remote Code Execution - status : fixed in 7.1.20b ( reported in June 2014 ) - CVE-2014-5287/5288  ，   ， An interesting remote code execution vector can be found through the attack payload below :   ，   ， http : /x.x.x.x/progs/fwaccess/add/1 | command  ，   ， The web application functionality is based on multiple bash scripts contained in the /usr/wui/progs folder. The application is using CGI so that the scripts can handle HTTP requests.  ，   ，   ， We notice that if the result of the command on line 285 is not positive ( check on 286 )  , then seterrmsg function is called.  ，   ，   ， On line 318 we see a dangerous \"eval\" against our parameters. By simply attempting multiple characters , the seterrmsg function is invoked and returns plenty of interesting information :   ，   ， http : /x.x.x.x/progs/fwaccess/add/1'ls  ，   ， Response :   ，   ， HTTP/1.1 200 OK  ， Date : Sat , 27 Dec 2014 23 : 25 : 55 GMT  ， Server : mini-http/1.0 ( unix )   ， Connection : close",
