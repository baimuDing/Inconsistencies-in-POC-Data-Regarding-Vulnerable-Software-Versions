The software was developed to reduce  ， the costs of using new media in education and further training and to  ， ensure the maximum level of customer influence in the implementation of  ， the software. ILIAS is published under the General Public Licence and  ， free of charge.\"  ， Due to inconsistencies in parameter handling ILIAS is vulnerable to  ， reflected cross-site-scripting in various locations.  ，  ， Vulnerability Details :   ， Request parameters handled through the saveParameter (  ) mechanism can be  ， supplied through both URL parameters and application/x-www-form-urlencoded  ， POST bodies. These parameters will be included in the constructed HTML form  ， action URL without further encoding. While URL parameters are generally  ， sanitized by stripping HTML tags and a variety of characters , this is not  ， the case for parameters from the POST body.  ， Requesting a page with a saved parameter using a POST request , and supplying  ， that parameter inside the POST body , will therefor result in that value  ， being embedded into the page without proper escaping.  ， Instances of this issue have been identified in the ilStartupGui as well  ， as the ilCalendarAppointmentGUI pages , but there are likely more vulnerable  ， instances.  ， The necessary POST request can be initied by a third party site by  ， submitting a HTML form through JavaScript.  ， An attacker crafting such a site and tricking an user into visiting it  ， can therefor supply arbitrary JavaScript code to be executed in the  ， context of the target application.  ， This is suited to either execute arbitrary operations as an already  ， authenticated users or to steal a not-yet authenticated users credentials  ， by redirecting him to the regular login page with malicious JavaScript code  ， embedded sending them to a third-party server.  ，  ， Proof of Concept ( PoC )  :   ， 'seed' is a saved parameter for the add action of ilCalendarAppointmentGUI  ， which can be accessed via POST ,   ， POST  ， /ILIAS-5.3.2/ilias.php?cmd=add&cmdClass=ilcalendarappointmentgui&cmdNode=zm : ao : b1&baseClass=ilPersonalDesktopGUI  ， HTTP/1.1  ，  [ . ]   ， Cookie : PHPSESSID= [ . ]  ; ilClientId=test  ， Content-Type : application/x-www-form-urlencoded  ，  [ . ] ",
