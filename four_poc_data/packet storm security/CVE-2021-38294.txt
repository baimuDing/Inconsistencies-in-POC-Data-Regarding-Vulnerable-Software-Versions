In order for the vulnerability to be exploitable , there must have been at least one topology submitted to the server. The topology may be active or inactive , but at least one must be present. Successful exploitation results in remote code execution as the user running Apache Storm. This vulnerability was patched in versions 2.1.1 , 2.2.1 and 1.2.4. This exploit was tested on version 2.2.0 which is affected.  ， cve : advisories | CVE-2021-38294  ，  ， desc :  #   ，  # This module requires Metasploit : https : /metasploit.com/download  ，  # Current source : https : /github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework  ，  ， require 'rex/proto/thrift'  ， require 'rex/stopwatch'  ，  ， 'Description' => %q{  ， This module exploits an unauthenticated command injection vulnerability within the Nimbus service component of Apache Storm.  ， The getTopologyHistory RPC method method takes a single argument which is the name of a user which is  ， concatenated into a string that is executed by bash.
