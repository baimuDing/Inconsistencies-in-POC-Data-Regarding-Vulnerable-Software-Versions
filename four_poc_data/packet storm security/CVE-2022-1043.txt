    "text": "title : io_uring Same Type Object Reuse Privilege Escalation  ， detail : This Metasploit module exploits a bug in io_uring leading to an additional put_cred (  ) that can be exploited to hijack credentials of other processes. This exploit will spawn SUID programs to get the freed cred object reallocated by a privileged process and abuse them to create a SUID root binary that will pop a shell. The dangling cred pointer will , however , lead to a kernel panic as soon as the task terminates and its credentials are destroyed. We therefore detach from the controlling terminal , block all signals and rest in silence until the system shuts down and we get killed hard , just to cry in vain , seeing the kernel collapse. The bug affected kernels from v5.12-rc3 to v5.14-rc7. More than 1 CPU is required for exploitation. Successfully tested against Ubuntu 22.04.01 with kernel 5.13.12-051312-generic.  ， cve : advisories | CVE-2022-1043  ，  ， desc :  #   ，  # This module requires Metasploit : https : /metasploit.com/download  ，  # Current source : https : /github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework  ，   ， 'Description' => %q{  ， This module exploits a bug in io_uring leading to an additional put_cred (  )   ， that can be exploited to hijack credentials of other processes.  ， We spawn SUID programs to get the free'd cred object reallocated by a  ， privileged process and abuse them to create a SUID root binary ourselves  ， that'll pop a shell.  ， The dangling cred pointer will , however , lead to a kernel panic as soon as  ， the task terminates and its credentials are destroyed.
