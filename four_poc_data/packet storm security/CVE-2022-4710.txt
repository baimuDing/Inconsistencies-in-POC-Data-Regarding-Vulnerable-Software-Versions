    "text": "title : WordPress Royal Elementor 1.3.59 XSS / CSRF / Insufficient Access Controls  ， detail : WordPress Royal Elementor add-ons versions 1.3.59 and below suffer from cross site request forgery , insufficient access control , cross site scripting vulnerabilities.  ， cve : advisories | CVE-2022-4700 , CVE-2022-4701 , CVE-2022-4702 , CVE-2022-4703 , CVE-2022-4704 , CVE-2022-4705 , CVE-2022-4707 , CVE-2022-4708 , CVE-2022-4709 , CVE-2022-4710 , CVE-2022-4711  ，  ， desc : On December 23 , 2022 , the Wordfence Threat Intelligence team initiated the responsible disclosure process for a set of 11 vulnerabilities in Royal Elementor Addons , a WordPress plugin with over 100 , 000 installations. The plugin developers responded on December 26 , and we sent over the full disclosure that day.  ， We released a firewall rule protecting against these vulnerabilities to Wordfence Premium , Care , and Response customers on December 23 , 2022. Sites still running the free version of Wordfence will receive the same protection 30 days later , on January 22 , 2023.  ， While none of the vulnerabilities were critical , several of them could have been used by any authenticated user to modify content , disable plugins , or even temporarily take down the site in some circumstances. Additionally one of the patched vulnerabilities was a Reflected Cross-Site Scripting vulnerability which could have been used to take over the site if an attacker was able to trick an administrator into performing an action , such as clicking a link.  ， This email content has also been published on our blog and you're welcome to post a comment there if you'd like to join the conversation. Or you can read the full post in this email.  ， Vulnerability Details  ， The primary set of issues we found with Royal Elementor Addons was due to a lack of access control and nonce checks on various AJAX actions in the plugin.  ， Description : Insufficient Access Control to Theme Activation  ， Affected Plugin : Royal Elementor Addons  ， Plugin Slug : royal-elementor-addons  ， Affected Versions : <= 1.3.59  ， CVE ID : CVE-2022-4700  ， CVSS Score : 5.4 ( Medium )   ， CVSS Vector : CVSS : 3.1/AV : N/AC : L/PR : L/UI : N/S : U/C : N/I : L/A : L  ， Researcher/s : Ramuel Gall  ， Fully Patched Version : 1.3.60  ， Royal Elementor Addons has an option to quickly activate the recommended Royal Elementor Kit theme. Unfortunately , this is performed via an AJAX function , wpr_activate_required_theme , which did not perform capability or nonce checks , or even check if the theme was installed on the site. This meant that any logged-in user , such as a subscriber , could change a vulnerable sites theme. If the Royal Elementor Kit theme was not installed on the site , this would result in a loss of availability as the site would fail to load and instead display an error message.  ， Description : Insufficient Access Control to Plugin Deactivation  ， Affected Plugin : Royal Elementor Addons  ， Plugin Slug : royal-elementor-addons  ， Affected Versions : <= 1.3.59  ， CVE ID : CVE-2022-4702  ， CVSS Score : 5.4 ( Medium )   ， CVSS Vector : CVSS : 3.1/AV : N/AC : L/PR : L/UI : N/S : U/C : N/I : L/A : L  ， Researcher/s : Ramuel Gall  ， Fully Patched Version : 1.3.60  ， Royal Elementor Addons has an option to revert the site to a compatible state for imported templates via the wpr_fix_royal_compatibility AJAX function. This involves deactivating all but a short list of hard-coded plugins. As the function did not use capability or nonce checks , this means that any authenticated user could deactivate plugins necessary for site functionality as well as any security plugins that do not specifically block this action. This could cause the site to become unavailable or vulnerable to additional exploits.  ， Description : Insufficient Access Control to Template Import  ， Affected Plugin : Royal Elementor Addons  ， Plugin Slug : royal-elementor-addons  ， Affected Versions : <= 1.3.59  ， CVE ID : CVE-2022-4704  ， CVSS Score : 5.4 ( Medium )   ， CVSS Vector : CVSS : 3.1/AV : N/AC : L/PR : L/UI : N/S : U/C : N/I : L/A : L  ， Researcher/s : Ramuel Gall  ， Fully Patched Version : 1.3.60",
