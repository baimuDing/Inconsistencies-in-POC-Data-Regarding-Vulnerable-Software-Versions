    "text": "title : Dell OpenManage Server Administrator 8.4 Directory Traversal  ， detail : OpenManage Server Administrator version 8.4 suffers from a directory traversal vulnerability.  ， cve : advisories | CVE-2016-4004  ，  ， desc : Now that a patch has been available for Dell OMSA to fix CVE-2016-4004 et  ， al for a few days , I feel more comfortable discussing a severe variant of  ， the vulnerability that works against Linux hosts ( new !  ) and does not  ， require credentials that work on the victim host ( new !  ) .  ， Admins running Dell OMSA on their servers should update the application to  ， v8.5.  ， The following can be treated as an addendum to [ 1 ] and a response to [ 2 ]  ,   ， and has been found to work on Dell OMSA 7.x and 8.x before 8.5. Testing  ， occurred on CentOS 6 , CentOS 7 and RHEL 7. In all cases , the application  ， was installed using the consolidated Linux download and installing the RHEL  ， packages ( which , for CentOS , required minor modifications to the installer  ， such that it identified CentOS as RHEL ) .  ， Introduction =  ， Two major shortcomings of [ 1 ] were as follows :   ， 1 : Certain security checks on the file parameter required traversing into a  ， potentially non-existent directory and back out of it , something which is  ， allowed on Windows but not on Linux.  ， 2 : The exploit required logging in to the application as a privileged user.  ， Both of these shortcomings can be easily resolved.  ， Support for Linux =  ， The first shortcoming can be resolved as follows :   ， tl ; dr : upload a file , get a valid link , and then put the directory  ， traversal in the app parameter , not the file parameter  ， There is another parameter you can optionally use , app , which does not  ， appear to have security checks done on it , and thus lets you do a clean  ， directory traversal that would work on Linux.  ， At this point , the only concern is the value of the parameter path , which  ， both needs to exist and needs to be one of the allowed values. There is  ， e-mail form functionality with attachment capabilities in this application ,   ， which serves our purposes well. Either click the aE-mail [ Page ] a button  ， anywhere throughout the application , or choose to upload a file as an  ， attachment to an e-mail , and a link will appear in the e-mail form  ， representing a new attachment. You may use the value of the path attribute  ， in the link , knowing that the path now exists.  ， If the application doesnat have SMTP settings configured , the e-mail form  ， may not display , but that does not stop you from uploading a file if you  ， issue an appropriate POST request.  ， If you scripted up logging into your own server , uploading an attachment ,   ， and then abusing the vulnerability , the latter might look like :   ， https : /IP : 1311/VID/ViewFile?path=/oma/upload/0&app=././././././././././././././.&file=etc/shadow&vid=VID  ， Avoiding Authentication =  ， The second shortcoming can be resolved as follows :   ， tl ; dr : click aManage Remote Nodea at the bottom of the login screen , then  ， provide the IP of a server you control  ， If you read between the lines in [ 1 ]  , it merely says awhen authenticated as  ， an admina ; it never says an admin on the victim host. On a default  ， installation of Dell OMSA with all components installed on a supported Dell  ， server , at the bottom of the login screen youall notice a link that reads  ， aManage Remote Nodea , which will take you to the aManaged System Logina  ， page. Here , you can specify both a host and the credentials for that  ， host. If only the web server interface component is installed , or the  ， server is not a Dell server , the application may default to showing this  ， aManaged System Logina page.  ， When you choose to log in to a specific host , the application will attempt  ， to connect to a WS-Management server on the specified host , authenticate if  ， necessary , and you will be logged into the application if the WS-Management  ， server supports certain Dell-specific extensions.  ， For those of us either on a budget or that wouldnat like bringing Dell  ， servers along on pentests , it isnat terribly complicated to create a fake  ， server that passes for a amanaged systema. Two example minimalistic  ， implementations that are just barely enough to get you through the front  ， door and to the vulnerability are available at [ 3 ] and [ 4 ] . These example  ， implementations donat require authentication , so any username and password  ， will work. Youall probably need to make sure you check the aIgnore  ， certificate warningsa option , depending on your setup.  ， If you scripted up the Linux exploit above , at this point youad just modify  ， the login part to point to your system , and make sure a fake server is  ， running.  ， For the moment , Iall leave scripting all of this up as an exercise for the  ， reader.  ， References =  ，  [ 1 ]  : https : /www.exploit-db.com/exploits/39486/  ，  [ 2 ]  :   ， http : /topics-cdn.dell.com/pdf/dell-openmanage-server-administrator-8.4_Release%20Notes10_en-us.pdf  ，  [ 3 ]  : https : /github.com/hantwister/FakeDellOM  ，  [ 4 ]  : https : /www.exploit-db.com/exploits/39909/ ( lines 65-107 ) ",
