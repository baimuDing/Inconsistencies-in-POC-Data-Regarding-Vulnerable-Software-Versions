    "text": "title : Rock RMS File Upload / Account Takeover / Information Disclosure  ， detail : Rock RMS suffers from arbitrary file upload , account takeover , and personal information disclosure vulnerabilities. Various versions are affected.  ， cve : advisories | CVE-2019-18641 , CVE-2019-18642 , CVE-2019-18643  ，  ， desc : Title  ，  ， Multiple vulnerabilities found in Rock RMS including RCE and account takeover. A total of three CVEs were issued for the vulnerabilities ( CVE-2019-18641 , CVE-2019-18642 , CVE-2019-18643 )   ， Product Description  ，  ， Rock RMS is an open source CRM. Although the product is free , they request a paid subscription based on number of users. In some cases , early access to patches require a paid subscription.  ， Vulnerability Descriptions  ，  ， 1  ， Name : File upload restriction bypass - CVE-2019-18643  ， CVSS score : 9.8 - CVSS : 3.0/AV : N/AC : L/PR : N/UI : N/S : U/C : H/I : H/A : H  ， Details : The file upload functionality using the fileUpload.ashx page was vulnerable to uploading malicious files by bypassing the file extension restrictions. Rock RMS uses a black list of file extensions which is checked upon uploading a file. The logic for the black list validation was vulnerable to bypass leading to arbitrary file uploads resulting in RCE. There were other issues with the file upload functionality such as being able to tamper the upload location which led to the ability to upload files to any directory on the system. Several failed patches were released for this vulnerability which partially addressed the issue but the product remained vulnerable to exploitation until the final patch was released.  ， Disclosure dates :   ， 01/09/2019 - initial disclosure of filetype restriction bypass  ， 03/17/2019 - second disclosure informing that the 8.6 patch did not fully fix the vulnerability. File upload is still vulnerable by tweaking the exploit  ， 07/10/2019 - third disclosure informing that the 8.8 patch did not fully fix the vulnerability. File upload is still vulnerable by tweaking the exploit  ， 11/03/2019 - fourth disclosure informing that the 8.9 patch did not fully fix the vulnerability. File upload is still vulnerable by tweaking the exploit  ， Patch date and version : Final patch was released on 11/05/2019 for version 8.10 and on 11/06/2019 for version 9.4. Vulnerable versions are < 8.10 and 9.0 - 9.3.  ， 2  ， Name : Account takeover - CVE-2019-18642  ， CVSS score : 9.8 - CVSS : 3.0/AV : N/AC : L/PR : N/UI : N/S : U/C : H/I : H/A : H  ， Details : When a low privileged user updates their profile , the user ID is sent to the server. This ID can be tampered to make changes to any other user including the system administrator account. Changing the email address of another account allows an attacker to perform a password reset then login and take over the account. Performing this action on the administrator account leads to full application compromise.  ， Disclosure date : 01/16/2019  ， Patch date and version : 02/19/2019 in version 8.6  ， 3  ， Name : User personal information leak - CVE-2019-18641  ， CVSS score : 5.3 - CVSS : 3.0/AV : N/AC : L/PR : N/UI : N/S : U/C : L/I : N/A : N  ， Details : The GetVCard functionality was not setup with any security. This allowed any unauthenticated user to loop through all sequential user ID's and exfiltrate user's personal information they have entered for their account. This information could include first name , last name , phone numbers , email address , physical address , etc.  ， Disclosure date : 01/09/2019  ， Patch date and version : 02/19/2019 in version 8.6  ， There were other security risks that were identified in the product such as several API calls that were not secured , reflected XSS and private calendar access leading to information leakage.  ， Detection and Remediation  ，  ， Firstly , update to the most recent patch as soon as possible. Once updated , there are a few things that can be checked to determine if any malicious activity has taken place on your implementation of Rock RMS.  ， -Review the Content directory for any files that have file extensions that could be malicious such as aspx  ， -Check all web logs you have to see if the file upload functionality was used to upload to a directory outside the Content directory  ， -Check web logs for suspicious iterations looping through objects such as vcard IDs",
