This is the twenty-seventh entry  ， in the series. This information is available in more detail on my blog  ， at http : /blog.skylined.nl/20161207001.html. There you can find a repro  ， that triggered this issue in addition to the information below.  ， Today's release is not very interesting , because it was one of the first  ， bugs I found and reported to the ZDI back in 2012 , before I had  ， developed the tools and skills to properly analyze MSIE bugs. This  ， report is therefore very scarce in information.  ， If you find this information useful , and would like to help me make time  ， to continue releasing this kind of information , you can make a donation  ， in bitcoin to 183yyxa9s1s1f7JBpAPHPmzAQ346y91Rx5DX.  ， Follow me on http : /twitter.com/berendjanwever for daily browser bugs.  ， MSIE 9 MSHTML CDispNode : InsertSiblingNode use-after-free  ，  ，  ( MS13-037 , CVE-2013-1309 )   ， Synopsis  ，  ， A specially crafted web-page can trigger a memory corruption  ， vulnerability in Microsoft Internet Explorer 9.
