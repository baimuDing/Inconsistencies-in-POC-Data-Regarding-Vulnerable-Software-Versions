VoIP Analog Phone  ， Adapter integrates legacy Phones and Fax machines into a UCC Environment.  ， High-quality voice and reliable fax over any IP network. All-IP does not end  ， when analog terminals have to be integrated. Security and quality guaranteed.\"  ， Due to an error in the authorization mechanism and improper input validation ,   ， the device allows unauthenticated adversaries to execute OS commands via  ， the web interface.  ，  ， Vulnerability Details :   ， SySS GmbH found an unauthenticated OS command injection vulnerability in  ， SmartNode 200 ( SN200 ) devices.  ， The SN200 devices offer a \"Network Diagnostic Commands\" feature to  ， administrative users. This feature is designed to execute network diagnostic  ， commands like ping. However , as SySS GmbH discovered , the feature can be  ， used to execute arbitrary system commands.  ， Furthermore , a flaw in the authorization mechanism was found. This issue allows  ， unauthenticated adversaries to execute system commands via the affected feature.  ，  ， Proof of Concept ( PoC )  :   ， The following HTTP request shows how the system command \"id\" is executed  ， on the device :   ，  ， POST /rest/xx/xx?executeAsync HTTP/1.1  ， Cookie : AuthToken= ; AuthGroup=superuser ; UserName=admin  ，  [ . shortened . ]   ， Connection : close  ， {\"cmd\" : \"/usr/bin/id\" , \"arguments\" :  [  ] }  ，  ， The following output from the web interface shows that the command has  ， been executed :   ，  ，  * Command started *   ，  [ . shortened . ]   ， uid=0 ( root ) gid=0 ( root )   ， PING 127.0.0.1 ( 127.0.0.1 )  : 56 data bytes  ， 64 bytes from 127.0.0.1 : seq=0 ttl=64 time=1.025 ms  ， 64 bytes from 127.0.0.1 : seq=1 ttl=64 time=1.781 ms  ，  * Command completed *   ，  ， Especially noteworthy is that an empty cookie \"AuthToken\" can be used in  ， order to bypass the authorization checks.  ， Since the vulnerability is still active , parts of the PoC have been redacted.  ，  ， Solution :   ， A patch for this issue is not yet available. Therefore , it is recommended to  ， disable the vulnerable \"Network Diagnostic Commands\" feature if possible.  ， Furthermore , it is advised to block network access to the HTTP interface  ， either on the device directly or via firewall.",
