    "text": "title : HP LoadRunner lrFileIOService ActiveX WriteFileString Remote Code Execution  ， detail : This Metasploit module exploits a vulnerability on the lrFileIOService ActiveX , as installed with HP LoadRunner 11.50. The vulnerability exists in the WriteFileString method , which allow the user to write arbitrary files. It's abused to drop a payload embedded in a dll , which is later loaded through the Init (  ) method from the lrMdrvService control , by abusing an insecure LoadLibrary call. This Metasploit module has been tested successfully on IE8 on Windows XP. Virtualization based on the Low Integrity Process , on Windows Vista and 7 , will stop this module because the DLL will be dropped to a virtualized folder , which isn't used by LoadLibrary.  ， cve : advisories | CVE-2013-4798 , OSVDB-95642  ，  ， desc :  #   ，  # This file is part of the Metasploit Framework and may be subject to  ，  # redistribution and commercial restrictions.
