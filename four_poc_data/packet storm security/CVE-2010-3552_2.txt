    "text": "title : Sun Java Runtime New Plugin docbase Buffer Overflow  ， detail : This Metasploit module exploits a flaw in the new plugin component of the Sun Java Runtime Environment before v6 Update 22. By specifying specific parameters to the new plugin , an attacker can cause a stack-based buffer overflow and execute arbitrary code. When the new plugin is invoked with a \"launchjnlp\" parameter , it will copy the contents of the \"docbase\" parameter to a stack-buffer using the \"sprintf\" function. A string of 396 bytes is enough to overflow the 256 byte stack buffer and overwrite some local variables as well as the saved return address. NOTE : The string being copied is first passed through the \"WideCharToMultiByte\". Due to this , only characters which have a valid localized multibyte representation are allowed. Invalid characters will be replaced with question marks ( '?' ) . This vulnerability was originally discovered independently by both Stephen Fewer and Berend Jan Wever ( SkyLined ) . Although exhaustive testing hasn't been done , all versions since version 6 Update 10 are believed to be affected by this vulnerability. This vulnerability was patched as part of the October 2010 Oracle Patch release.  ， cve : advisories | CVE-2010-3552  ，  ， desc :  #   ，  #  $ Id : java_docbase_bof.rb 10820 2010-10-25 20 : 22 : 08Z jduck $   ，   ，  # This file is part of the Metasploit Framework and may be subject to  ，  # redistribution and commercial restrictions.
