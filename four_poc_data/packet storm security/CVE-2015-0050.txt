The  ， issue does not appear to be easily exploitable.  ， Known affected software , attack vectors and mitigations  ，  ，  * Microsoft Internet Explorer 8  ， An attacker would need to get a target user to open a specially  ， crafted web-page. Disabling Javascript should prevent an attacker  ， from triggering the vulnerable code path.  ， Description  ，  ， The issue requires rather complex manipulation of the DOM and results in  ， reading a value immediately following an object. The lower three bits of  ， this value are returned by the function doing the reading , resulting in  ， a return value in the range 0-7. After exhaustively skipping over the  ， read AV and having that function return each value , no other side  ， effects were noticed. For that reason I assume this issue is hard if not  ， impossible to exploit and did not investigate further. It is still  ， possible that there may be subtle effects that I did not notice that  ， allow exploitation in some form or other.  ， Time-line  ，  ，  *  * June 2014 *  : This vulnerability was found through fuzzing.  ，  *  * October 2014 *  : This vulnerability was submitted to ZDI.  ，  *  * October 2014 *  : This vulnerability was rejected by ZDI.  ，  *  * November 2014 *  : This vulnerability was reported to MSRC.  ，  *  * February 2015 *  : This vulnerability was addressed by Microsoft in  ， MS15-009.  ，  *  * November 2016 *  : Details of this issue are released.  ， Cheers ,   ， SkyLined  ， Repro.html  ， < !
