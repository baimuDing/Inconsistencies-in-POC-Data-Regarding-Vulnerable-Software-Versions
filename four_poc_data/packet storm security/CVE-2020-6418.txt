    "text": "title : Google Chrome 80 JSCreate Side-Effect Type Confusion  ， detail : This Metasploit module exploits an issue in Google Chrome version 80.0.3987.87 ( 64 bit ) . The exploit corrupts the length of a float array ( float_rel )  , which can then be used for out of bounds read and write on adjacent memory. The relative read and write is then used to modify a UInt64Array ( uint64_aarw ) which is used for read and writing from absolute memory. The exploit then uses WebAssembly in order to allocate a region of RWX memory , which is then replaced with the payload shellcode. The payload is executed within the sandboxed renderer process , so the browser must be run with the -no-sandbox option for the payload to work correctly.  ， cve : advisories | CVE-2020-6418  ，  ， desc :  #   ，  # This module requires Metasploit : https : /metasploit.com/download  ，  # Current source : https : /github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework",
