    "text": "title : VMware vCenter Server File Upload / Remote Code Execution  ， detail : This Metasploit module exploits an unauthenticated OVA file upload and path traversal in VMware vCenter Server to write a JSP payload to a web-accessible directory. Fixed versions are 6.5 Update 3n , 6.7 Update 3l , and 7.0 Update 1c. Note that later vulnerable versions of the Linux appliance aren't exploitable via the webshell technique. Furthermore , writing an SSH public key to /home/vsphere-ui/.ssh/authorized_keys works , but the user's non-existent password expires 90 days after install , rendering the technique nearly useless against production environments. You'll have the best luck targeting older versions of the Linux appliance. The Windows target should work ubiquitously.  ， cve : advisories | CVE-2021-21972  ，  ， desc :  #   ，  # This module requires Metasploit : https : /metasploit.com/download  ，  # Current source : https : /github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework  ，   ， 'Description' => %q{  ， This module exploits an unauthenticated OVA file upload and path  ， traversal in VMware vCenter Server to write a JSP payload to a  ， web-accessible directory.  ， Fixed versions are 6.5 Update 3n , 6.7 Update 3l , and 7.0 Update 1c.  ， Note that later vulnerable versions of the Linux appliance aren't  ， exploitable via the webshell technique.
