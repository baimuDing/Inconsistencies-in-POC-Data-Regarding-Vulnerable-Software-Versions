    "text": "title : WordPress VeronaLabs WP Statistics 13.1.4 SQL Injection  ， detail : WordPress VeronaLabs WP Statistics plugin versions 13.1.4 and suffer from a remote unauthenticated blind SQL injection vulnerability.  ， cve : advisories | CVE-2022-0513  ，  ， desc : On February 7 , 2022 , Security Researcher Cyku Hong from DEVCORE reported a vulnerability to us that they discovered in WP Statistics , a WordPress plugin installed on over 600 , 000 sites. This vulnerability made it possible for unauthenticated attackers to execute arbitrary SQL queries by appending them to an existing SQL query. This could be used to extract sensitive information like password hashes and secret keys from the database. On request , we assigned them the vulnerability identifier : CVE-2022-0513.  ， Even though Wordfence provides protection against this vulnerability , we strongly recommend ensuring that your site has been updated to the latest patched version of WP Statistics , which is version 13.1.5 at the time of this publication.  ， Description : Unauthenticated Blind SQL Injection  ， Affected Plugin : WP Statistics  ， Plugin Slug : wp-statistics  ， Plugin Developer : VeronaLabs  ， Affected Versions : <= 13.1.4  ， CVE ID : CVE-2022-0513  ， CVSS Score : 9.8 ( Critical )   ， CVSS Vector : CVSS : 3.1/AV : N/AC : L/PR : N/UI : N/S : U/C : H/I : H/A : H  ， Researcher/s : Cyku Hong from DEVCORE  ， Fully Patched Version : 13.1.5  ， WP Statistics is a WordPress plugin designed to provide a centralized hub for all of a WordPress sites statistics , such as visitor data , and it emphasizes storing this data locally to the WordPress site to preserve user privacy. As such , it is reasonable to expect that the plugin would implement a lot of functionality to store and retrieve information from the database through the use of SQL queries. Unfortunately , the implementation of one of these queries was insecure , creating a SQL Injection vulnerability.  ， When the Record Exclusions' feature was enabled , this vulnerability became exploitable. The Record Exclusions feature is designed to record when a visit , or a hit , is excluded from the sites statistics , such as visits by users with specific roles , login page access , and anything else that a site owner may have explicitly selected to exclude. It records that data to a separate database table so as not to contaminate the main statistical data the plugin collects.",
