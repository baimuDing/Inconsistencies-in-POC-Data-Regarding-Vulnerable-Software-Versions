The vulnerabilities , documented under CVE-2016-9553 , allow the remote compromise of the appliance's underlining Linux subsystem. The vulnerabilities have now been patched in the January 2017 4.3.1 release of the appliance line.  ， Here is a summary of the two vulnerabilities documented under CVE-2016-9553.  ， CVE ID  ， CVE-2016-9553<http : /cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-9553>  ， Vulnerability Details  ， The Sophos Web Appliance ( version 4.2.1.3 ) is vulnerable to two Remote Command Injection vulnerabilities affecting its web administrative interface. These vulnerabilities occur in the MgrReport.php ( /controllers/MgrReport.php ) component responsible for blocking and unblocking IP addresses that are able to access appliance.  ， The device doesn't properly escape the information passed in the variables 'unblockip' and 'blockip' before calling the shell_exec (  ) function which allows for system commands to be injected into the device.  ， The page that contains the vulnerabilities , /controllers/MgrReport.php , is accessed by a number of the machine's built in commands in administrative interface. The pages that call to the vulnerable page ( passed in the '&c=' parameter ) are : 'report' , 'trend_volume' , 'trend_suspect' , 'top_app_ctrl' , 'perf_latency' , 'perf_throughput' , 'users_browse_summary' , 'traf_sites' , 'traf_blocked' , 'traf_users' , 'users_virus_downloaders' , 'users_pua_downloaders' , 'users_highrisk' , 'users_policy_violators' , 'users_top_users_by_browse_time' , 'users_quota' , 'users_browse_time_by_user' , 'users_top_users_by_category' , 'users_site_visits_by_user' , 'users_category_visits_by_user' , 'users_monitored_search_queries' , 'users_app_ctrl' , 'traf_category' , 'traf_download' , and 'warned_sites'.  ， Exploitation of this vulnerability yields shell access to the remote machine under the system account 'spiderman'.  ， Vendor Response  ， Sophos has issued an update to correct this vulnerability.
