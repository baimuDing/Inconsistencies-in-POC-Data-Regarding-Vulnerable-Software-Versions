    "text": "title : Mac OS X Sudo Password Bypass  ， detail : This Metasploit module gains a session with root permissions on versions of OS X with sudo binary vulnerable to CVE-2013-1775. Tested working on Mac OS 10.7-10.8.4 , and possibly lower versions. If your session belongs to a user with Administrative Privileges ( the user is in the sudoers file and is in the \"admin group\" )  , and the user has ever run the \"sudo\" command , it is possible to become the super user by running `sudo -k` and then resetting the system clock to 01-01-1970. This Metasploit module will fail silently if the user is not an admin or if the user has never run the sudo command.  ， cve : advisories | CVE-2013-1775 , OSVDB-90677  ，  ， desc :  #   ，  # This file is part of the Metasploit Framework and may be subject to  ，  # redistribution and commercial restrictions.
