    "text": "title : IPConfigure Orchid VMS 2.0.5 Directory Traversal / Information Disclosure  ， detail : Orchid Core VMS is vulnerable to a directory traversal attack. This affects Linux and Windows operating systems. This allows a remote , unauthenticated attacker to send crafted GET requests to the application , which results in the ability to read arbitrary files outside of the applications web directory. This issue is further compounded as the Linux version of Orchid Core VMS application is running in context of a user in the sudoers group. As such , any file on the underlying system , for which the location is known , can be read. This Metasploit module was tested against 2.0.5. This has been fixed in 2.0.6.  ， cve : advisories | CVE-2018-10956  ，  ， desc : require 'msf/core'  ，   ， class MetasploitModule < Msf : Auxiliary  ， Rank = ExcellentRanking",
