    "text": "title : libxml 2.9.2 Stack Overflow  ， detail : libxml versions prior to 2.9.3 suffer from a stack overflow vulnerability when parsing a malicious file.  ， cve : advisories | CVE-2016-3627  ，  ， desc : Hi  ， This is a disclosure of the following issue that was raised a week ago  ， on the distro's mailing list. Both bugs on the gnome bugtracker are  ， currently private and should be made public now. The two attached  ， patches are based off the 2.9.3 libxml2 release.  ， A couple of weeks back while working on a related bug [ CVE-2016-3627 ] I  ， discovered a specially created xml file is capable of triggering a stack  ， overflow before libxml2 can detect its a invalid xml file.  ， We raised this issue upstream on 2016-04-18 and informed them that we  ， would place a two week embargo on the issue in case we didn't here back.  ， As of yet we have had no response so we have posted here.  ， https : /bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=765207  ， We intend to keep the current embargo ( ending May 3 ) unless we get  ， advise otherwise here. Below is a script to generate the xml file along  ， with a tested patch to fix the issue. I will also include our  ， unpublished patch and simplified reproducer for CVE-2016-3627 as again  ， we have had no response upstream and its likely that you will want to  ， fix this less severe issue at the same time.  ， https : /bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=762100  ， python3 repoducer.py ; xmllint repo.xml  ， repoducer.py  ，  ，  #  ! /bin/python3",
