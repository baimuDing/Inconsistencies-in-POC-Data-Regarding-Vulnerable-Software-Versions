    "text": "title : Western Digital MyCloud Unauthenticated Command Injection  ，  ， 'Description' => %q{  ， This module exploits authentication bypass ( CVE-2018-17153 ) and  ， command injection ( CVE-2016-10108 ) vulnerabilities in Western  ， Digital MyCloud before 2.30.196 in order to achieve  ， unauthenticated remote code execution as the root user.  ， The module first performs a check to see if the target is  ， WD MyCloud. If so , it attempts to trigger an authentication  ， bypass ( CVE-2018-17153 ) via a crafted GET request to  ， /cgi-bin/network_mgr.cgi. If the server responds as expected ,   ， the module assesses the vulnerability status by attempting to  ， exploit a commend injection vulnerability ( CVE-2016-10108 ) in  ， order to print a random string via the echo command. This is  ， done via a crafted POST request to /web/google_analytics.php.  ， If the server is vulnerable , the same command injection vector  ， is leveraged to execute the payload.  ， This module has been successfully tested against Western Digital  ， MyCloud version 2.30.183.  ， Note : based on the available disclosures , it seems that the  ， command injection vector ( CVE-2016-10108 ) might be exploitable  ， without the authentication bypass ( CVE-2018-17153 ) on versions  ， before 2.21.126. The obtained results on 2.30.183 imply that  ， the patch for CVE-2016-10108 did not actually remove the command  ， injection vector , but only prevented unauthenticated access to it.  ， }",
