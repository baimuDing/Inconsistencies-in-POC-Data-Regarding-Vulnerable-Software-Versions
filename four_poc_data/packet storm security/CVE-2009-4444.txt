Specifically, it is possible to upload ASP code via the ASP.NET connector in FCKEditor. The vulnerability requires that the remote server be running IIS. This vulnerability has been confirmed on FCKEditor 2.5.1 and 2.6.6.  ， cve:advisories | CVE-2009-4444  ， date_time:Aug 30, 2010  ， desc:R7-0036: FCKEditor.NET File Upload Code Execution  ， August 30, 2010  ， - Vulnerability Details:  ， FCKEditor contains a file renaming bug that allows remote code execution. Specifically, it is possible to upload ASP code via the ASP.NET connector in FCKEditor. The vulnerability requires that the remote server be running IIS. This vulnerability has been confirmed on FCKEditor 2.5.1 and 2.6.6.  ，   ， CVSS Vector: AV:R/AC:L/Au:NR/C:C/I:C/A:C  ， Browse to http:/<ip>fckeditor/editor/filemanager/connectors/test.html and choose the ASP.NET connector. By uploading a file with the same name as an existing file, that includes an underscore followed by a dot, it is possible to bypass the file renaming mitigation in place. For instance, when uploading a file twice with the name:  ，   ， myfile_.asp;.txt  ，   ， The first file would be renamed  ，   ， myfile_asp;.txt  ，   ， BUT the second file will be renamed  ，   ， myfile_.asp;(1).txt  ，   ， Due to the IIS semi-colon vulnerability (http:/cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2009-4444) the server will remotely execute myfile_.asp;(1).txt when the second file is accessed."
