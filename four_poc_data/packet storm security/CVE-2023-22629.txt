    "text": "title : Titan FTP Path Traversal  ， detail : Titan FTP server versions prior to 2.0.1.2102 suffer from a path traversal vulnerability.  ， cve : advisories | CVE-2023-22629  ，  ， desc : Titan FTP Server Path Traversal Vulnerability in move-file Function  ， Version : < 2.0.1.2102  ， CVE-2023-22629  ， CWE-24 : Path Traversal  ， TitanFTP Server is vulnerable to a path traversal attack in the move-file function. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by providing a specially crafted newPath parameter that contains directory traversal sequences ( e.g. , './' ) to move a file to a directory outside the intended directory. This can allow an attacker to access sensitive files and execute arbitrary code. The vulnerability exists because the server does not properly validate the user-supplied newPath parameter. As a result , an attacker can send a request with the malicious parameter to bypass the intended directory and access unauthorized files.  ， This is an authenticated exploit. An attacker would need a user account on the TitanFTP server , to upload the files.  ， CWE-427 : Uncontrolled Search Path Element  ， The service-application is vulnerable to a DLL search order hijack. It is importing several Windows DLL-files , like version.dll. By placing a proxy-DLL named version.dll exploiting the path traversal vulnerability , this DLL will proxy imports to the original version.dll also uploaded in the application directory , with the name version32.dll , one will gain Remote Code Execution on the server as NT System.  ， Exploit code  ， Using this batchfile , an authenticated attacker can upload 2 dll-files , doing DLL-Hijack by proxy. In this poc , I am uploading a reverse-shell DLL-File , named version.dll , that proxies exports to the original version.dll , here named version32.dll.",
