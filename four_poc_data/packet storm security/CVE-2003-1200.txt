    "text": "title : MDaemon <= 6.8.5 WorldClient form2raw.cgi Stack Overflow  ， detail : This Metasploit module exploits a stack overflow in Alt-N MDaemon SMTP server for versions 6.8.5 and earlier. When WorldClient HTTP server is installed ( default )  , a CGI script is provided to accept html FORM based emails and deliver via MDaemon.exe , by writing the CGI output to the Raw Queue. When X-FromCheck is enabled ( also default )  , the temporary form2raw.cgi data is copied by MDaemon.exe and a stack based overflow occurs when an excessively long From field is specified. The RawQueue is processed every 1 minute by default , to a maximum of 60 minutes. Keep this in mind when choosing payloads or setting WfsDelay. You'll need to wait. Furthermore , this exploit uses a direct memory jump into a nopsled ( which isn't very reliable ) . Once the payload is written into the Raw Queue by Form2Raw , MDaemon will continue to crash/execute the payload until the CGI output is manually deleted from the queue in C : \\MDaemon\\RawFiles\\ * .raw.  ， cve : advisories | CVE-2003-1200  ，  ， desc :  #   ，  #  $ Id $   ，   ，  # This file is part of the Metasploit Framework and may be subject to  ，  # redistribution and commercial restrictions.
