    "text": "title : Microsoft Windows NtUserMNDragOver Local Privilege Escalation  ， detail : This Metasploit module exploits a NULL pointer dereference vulnerability in MNGetpItemFromIndex (  )  , which is reachable via a NtUserMNDragOver (  ) system call. The NULL pointer dereference occurs because the xMNFindWindowFromPoint (  ) function does not effectively check the validity of the tagPOPUPMENU objects it processes before passing them on to MNGetpItemFromIndex (  )  , where the NULL pointer dereference will occur. This module has been tested against Windows 7 x86 SP0 and SP1. Offsets within the solution may need to be adjusted to work with other versions of Windows , such as Windows Server 2008.  ， cve : advisories | CVE-2019-0808  ，  ， desc :  #   ，  # This module requires Metasploit : https : /metasploit.com/download  ，  # Current source : https : /github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework  ，  ， require 'msf/core/post/file'  ， require 'msf/core/exploit/exe'  ， require 'msf/core/post/windows/priv'  ，  ， 'Description' => %q{  ， This module exploits a NULL pointer dereference vulnerability in  ， MNGetpItemFromIndex (  )  , which is reachable via a NtUserMNDragOver (  ) system call.  ， The NULL pointer dereference occurs because the xMNFindWindowFromPoint (  )   ， function does not effectively check the validity of the tagPOPUPMENU  ， objects it processes before passing them on to MNGetpItemFromIndex (  )  ,   ， where the NULL pointer dereference will occur.  ， This module has been tested against Windows 7 x86 SP0 and SP1.
