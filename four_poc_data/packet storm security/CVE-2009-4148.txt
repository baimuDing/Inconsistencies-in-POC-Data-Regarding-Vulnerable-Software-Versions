DAZ Studio can be accessed via a scripting language which allows for quite a bit of diversity in tool creation. DAZ Studio does not ask for any confirmation from the user prior to executing a scripting file with any of the following extensions: .ds, .dsa, .dse, .dsb. An attacker could abuse the scripting interface by enticing an unsuspecting user to open a malicious scripting file, thus obtaining remote code execution. Proof of concept code included.  ， cve:advisories | CVE-2009-4148  ， date_time:Dec 3, 2009  ， desc:-BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-  ， Hash: SHA1  ， Core Security Technologies - CoreLabs Advisory  ， http:/www.coresecurity.com/corelabs/  ， DAZ Studio Arbitrary Command Execution  ， 1. *Advisory Information*  ， Title: DAZ Studio Arbitrary Command Execution  ， Advisory Id: CORE-2009-0911  ， Advisory URL:  ， http:/www.coresecurity.com/content/dazstudio-scripting-injection  ， Date published: 2009-12-02  ， Date of last update: 2009-12-01  ， Vendors contacted: DAZ  ， Release mode: User release  ， 2. *Vulnerability Information*  ， Class: Insufficient UI Warning of Dangerous Operations [CWE-357]  ， Impact: Code execution  ， Remotely Exploitable: Yes  ， Locally Exploitable: No  ， Bugtraq ID: 37176  ， CVE Name: CVE-2009-4148  ， 3. *Vulnerability Description*  ， DAZ Studio [2] is a 3D figure illustration/animation application  ， released by DAZ 3D Inc.
