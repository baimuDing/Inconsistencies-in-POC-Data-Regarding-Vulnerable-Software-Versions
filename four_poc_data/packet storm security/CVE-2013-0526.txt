This flaw exist because webapp variables are not sanitized. In this case , parameters $ count and $ size from ping.php allow to create a special crafted URL to inject text to an exec (  ) so it can be arbitrary used to execute any command on the KVM embedded linux.  ， cve : advisories | CVE-2013-0526  ，  ， desc : I. Product description  ， The IBM 1754 GCM family provides KVM over IP and serial console management  ， technology in a single appliance.  ， II. Vulnerability information  ， Impact : Command execution  ， Remotely exploitable : yes  ， CVE : 2013-0526  ， CVS Score : 8.5  ， III. Vulnerability details  ， GCM16 ( v.1.18.0.22011 ) and older versions of this KVM switch contain a flaw  ， that allows a remote authenticated user to execute unauthorized commands as  ， root.  ， This flaw exist because webapp variables are not sanitised. In this case ,   ， parameters $ count and $ size from ping.php allow to create a special crafted  ， URL to inject text to an exec (  ) so it can be arbitrary used to execute any  ， command on the KVM embedded linux.  ， IV. Proof of concept  ， Following is a simple exploit that lead to root access to the device ,   ， opening a telnet and creating a new user with root permission without  ， password ( sessid and target are hardcoded so it must be changed to work )  :   ，  #  ! /usr/bin/python  ， \"  ， This exploit for Avocent KVM switch allows to gain root access to embedded  ， device. SessionId ( avctSessionId ) is neccesary for this to work , so you  ， need a valid user. Default user is \"Admin\" with blank password.  ， After running exploit , connect using telnet to device with user target  ，  ( pass : target ) then do \"/tmp/su - superb\" to gain root  ， \"",
