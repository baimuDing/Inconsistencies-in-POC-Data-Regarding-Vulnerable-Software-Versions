    "text": "title : WordPress PHPMailer Host Header Command Injection  ， detail : This Metasploit module exploits a command injection vulnerability in WordPress version 4.6 with Exim as an MTA via a spoofed Host header to PHPMailer , a mail-sending library that is bundled with WordPress. A valid WordPress username is required to exploit the vulnerability. Additionally , due to the altered Host header , exploitation is limited to the default virtual host , assuming the header isn't mangled in transit. If the target is running Apache 2.2.32 or 2.4.24 and later , the server may have HttpProtocolOptions set to Strict , preventing a Host header containing parens from passing through , making exploitation unlikely.  ， cve : advisories | CVE-2016-10033  ，  ， desc :  #   ，  # This module requires Metasploit : http : /metasploit.com/download  ，  # Current source : https : /github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework",
