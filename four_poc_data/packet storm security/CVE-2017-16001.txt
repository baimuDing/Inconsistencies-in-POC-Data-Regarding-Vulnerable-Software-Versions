Hashicorp pushed some mitigations for this issue fairly  ，  # quickly but unfortunately 5.0.1 is still exploitable with a slightly different  ，  # approach.  ，   ，  # They removed the chmod/chown shell commands from their osascript invocation and  ，  # instead simply executed their installer as root , but apparently didn't realise  ，  # that the installer is not root-owned so can be swapped out by a local attacker  ，  # during the process.  ，   ，  # This issue is fixed in version 5.0.2.  ，   ，  # https : /m4.rkw.io/vagrant_vmware_privesc_5.0.1.sh.txt  ，  # c38ecc9fdb4f37323338e8fd12b851133a2121f3505cde664e6d32f1ef49ba23",
