    "text": "title : JBoss Seam 2 File Upload / Execute  ， detail : Versions of the JBoss Seam 2 framework prior to 2.2.1CR2 fail to properly sanitize inputs to some JBoss Expression Language expressions. As a result , attackers can gain remote code execution through the application server. This Metasploit module leverages RCE to upload and execute a meterpreter payload. Versions of the JBoss AS admin-console are known to be vulnerable to this exploit , without requiring authentication. Tested against JBoss AS 5 and 6 , running on Linux with JDKs 6 and 7. This Metasploit module provides a more efficient method of exploitation - it does not loop to find desired Java classes and methods. NOTE : the check for upload success is not 100% accurate. NOTE 2 : The module uploads the meterpreter JAR and a JSP to launch it.  ， cve : advisories | CVE-2010-1871  ，  ， desc :  #   ，  # This module requires Metasploit : http/metasploit.com/download  ，  # Current source : https : /github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework  ，  ， require 'rex/proto/http'  ， require 'msf/core'",
