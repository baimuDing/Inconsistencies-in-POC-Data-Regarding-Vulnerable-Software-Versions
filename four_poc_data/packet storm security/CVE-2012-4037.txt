    "text": "title : Transmission BitTorrent Cross Site Scripting  ， detail : Transmission BitTorrent client versions prior to 2.61 suffer from a cross site scripting vulnerability.  ， cve : advisories | CVE-2012-4037  ，  ， desc : -BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-  ， Hash : SHA1  ， Vulnerability Report  ， Author : Justin C. Klein Keane <justin @ madirish.net>  ， Reported : July 19 , 2012  ， CVE-2012-4037  ， Description of Vulnerability :   ，  ， Transmission ( http : /www.transmissionbt.com ) is a popular , cross  ， platform , open source BitTorrent client. Transmission includes  ， functionality to enable a web based display of the application.  ， Unfortunately this web based client doesn't sanitize text from  ， .torrent files that are loaded into the client resulting in an  ， arbitrary script injection ( or cross site scripting ( XSS ) vulnerability.  ， Impact  ，  ， Clients loading a maliciously crafted .torrent file into Transmission  ， and viewing the web client could be subject to arbitrary script  ， injection , allowing an attacker to run arbitrary code in the context  ， of the victim's web browser. This could lead to privacy compromises  ，  ( such as if the script \"phoned home\" to another URL with client  ， information ) or client side attacks ( such as drive by downloads ) .  ， Systems affected :   ，  ， Transmission 2.50 on Fedora 17 was tested and shown to be vulnerable ,   ， but Transmission is a cross platform tool so it is possible versions  ，  ， are vulnerable as well.  ， Mitigating factors :   ，  ， The information displayed via the Transmission web client is loaded  ， via AJAX calls and is entirely event driven. This means malicious  ， scripts must be crafted to exploit the way in which content is  ， dynamically rendered. This presents some barrier , but is easy  ， bypassed by injecting event driven elements in the display. Malicious  ， script elements in the torrent name are easily visible via the desktop  ， client , but malicious elements in the 'created by' or 'comments'  ， elements are more difficult for end users to detect.",
