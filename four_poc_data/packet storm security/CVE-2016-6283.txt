The bug occurs at pages carrying attached files , even though the attached file name parameter is correctly sanitized upon submission , it is possible for an attacker to later edit the attached file name property and supply crafted data ( i.e HTML tags and script code ) without the occurrence of any security checks , resulting in an exploitable persistent cross site scripting injection.  ， cve : advisories | CVE-2016-6283  ，  ， desc : = [ Tempest Security Intelligence - ADV-3/2016 CVE-2016-6283 ] =  ， Persisted Cross-Site Scripting ( XSS ) in Confluence Jira Software  ，  ， Author ( s )  :   ， - Jodson Santos  ， - jodson.santos @ tempest.com.br  ， Tempest Security Intelligence - Recife , Pernambuco - Brazil  ， = [ Table of Contents ] =  ， 1.
