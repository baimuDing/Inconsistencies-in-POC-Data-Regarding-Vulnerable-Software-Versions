    "text": "title : WordPress Newsletter 7.8.9 Cross Site Scripting  ， detail : WordPress Newsletter plugin versions 7.8.9 and below suffer from a persistent cross site scripting vulnerability.  ， cve : advisories | CVE-2023-4772  ，  ， desc : Vulnerability Summary from Wordfence Intelligence  ， Description : Newsletter <= 7.8.9 Authenticated ( Contributor+ ) Stored Cross-Site Scripting via Shortcode  ， Affected Plugin : Newsletter Send awesome emails from WordPress  ， Plugin Slug : newsletter  ， Affected Versions : <= 7.8.9  ， CVE ID : CVE-2023-4772  ， CVSS Score : 6.4 ( Medium )   ， CVSS Vector : CVSS : 3.1/AV : N/AC : L/PR : L/UI : N/S : C/C : L/I : L/A : N  ， Researcher/s : Lana Codes  ， Fully Patched Version : 7.9.0  ， The Newsletter plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the newsletter_form shortcode in versions up to , and including , 7.8.9 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user supplied attributes. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers with contributor-level and above permissions to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.  ， Technical Analysis  ， The Newsletter plugin is a newsletter and email marketing system , with a drag and drop newsletter builder and many other features. It provides a shortcode (  [ newsletter_form ]  ) that displays the newsletter subscription form when added to a WordPress page.  ， Unfortunately , insecure implementation of the plugins shortcode functionality allows for the injection of arbitrary web scripts into these pages. Examining the code reveals that the shortcode has two types , one of which is the get_subscription_form_minimal method handling the minimal type in the NewsletterSubscription class. In vulnerable versions , this method does not adequately sanitize the user-supplied class input , and also does not adequately escape the class output when it displays the form. This makes it possible to inject attribute-based Cross-Site Scripting payloads via the class attribute.  ，  [ View this code snippet on the blog. ]   ， This makes it possible for threat actors to carry out stored XSS attacks. Once a script is injected into a page or post , it will execute each time a user accesses the affected page. While this vulnerability does require that a trusted contributor account is compromised , or that a user be able to register as a contributor , successful threat actors could steal sensitive information , manipulate site content , inject administrative users , edit files , or redirect users to malicious websites which are all severe consequences.  ， Shortcode Exploit Possibilities  ， Some previous versions of WordPress contained a vulnerability that allowed shortcodes supplied by unauthenticated commenters to be rendered in certain rare configurations , though the vast majority of sites have been automatically upgraded to a patched release of WordPress as of this writing.",
