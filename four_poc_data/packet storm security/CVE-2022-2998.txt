    "text": "title : Chrome LinkToTextMenuObserver : CompleteWithError Heap Use-After-Free  ， detail : A use-after-free issue exists in Chrome 104 and earlier versions. Processing maliciously crafted web content may lead to arbitrary code execution in the browser process. LinkToTextMenuObserver holds a raw pointer to a RenderFrameHost object , but is not owned by the frame host and does not watch for frame host destruction events. Therefore , if an attacker manages to destroy the frame host right after the observer is created but before the timeout task posted in StartLinkGenerationRequestWithTimeout (  ) is executed , use-after-free will occur.  ， cve : advisories | CVE-2022-2998  ，  ， desc : ",
