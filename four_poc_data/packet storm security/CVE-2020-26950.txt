    "text": "title : Firefox MCallGetProperty Write Side Effects Use-After-Free  ， detail : This Metasploit modules exploits CVE-2020-26950 , a use-after-free exploit in Firefox. The MCallGetProperty opcode can be emitted with unmet assumptions resulting in an exploitable use-after-free condition. This exploit uses a somewhat novel technique of spraying ArgumentsData structures in order to construct primitives. The shellcode is forced into executable memory via the JIT compiler , and executed by writing to the JIT region pointer. This exploit does not contain a sandbox escape , so firefox must be run with the MOZ_DISABLE_CONTENT_SANDBOX environment variable set , in order for the shellcode to run successfully. This vulnerability affects Firefox versions prior to 82.0.3 , Firefox ESR versions prior to 78.4.1 , and Thunderbird versions prior to 78.4.2 , however only Firefox versions up to 79 are supported as a target. Additional work may be needed to support other versions such as Firefox 82.0.1.  ， cve : advisories | CVE-2020-26950  ，  ， desc :  #   ，  # This module requires Metasploit : https : /metasploit.com/download  ，  # Current source : https : /github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework  ，   ， 'Description' => %q{  ， This modules exploits CVE-2020-26950 , a use after free exploit in Firefox.  ， The MCallGetProperty opcode can be emitted with unmet assumptions resulting  ， in an exploitable use-after-free condition.  ， This exploit uses a somewhat novel technique of spraying ArgumentsData  ， structures in order to construct primitives.
