    "text": "title : Joomla 1.6.0 SQL Injection / PHP Execution  ， detail : A vulnerability was discovered by Aung Khant that allows for exploitable SQL Injection attacks against a Joomla 1.6.0 install. This exploit attempts to leverage the SQL Injection to extract admin credentials , and use those credentials to execute arbitrary PHP code against the target. The vulnerability is due to a validation issue in /components/com_content/models/category.php that erroneously uses the \"string\" type whenever filtering the user supplied input. This issue was fixed by performing a whitelist check of the user supplied order data against the allowed order types , and also escaping the input.  ， cve : advisories | CVE-2011-1151  ，  ， desc :  # Requirements  ， require 'msf/core'  ，  # Class declaration",
